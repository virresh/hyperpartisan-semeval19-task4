__label__0 with the hillary clinton-donald trump debates upon us, the quadrennial question comes begging: do these showdowns matter? the chances for impact seem ripe this year. the two most unpopular major-party candidates in the history of abc news/washington post polls are facing off. donald trump's unorthodox campaign style and provocative positions have piqued public interest; the debates may be the single best opportunity for him to allay concerns about his qualifications, temperament and policy promises alike. hillary clinton, for her part, needs -– like trump -– to ease questions about her trustworthiness, as well as to spark greater enthusiasm among her supporters. can either candidate move the needle? it will be tough: a review of data since 1960 suggests that past debates have almost never directly and measurably changed the candidates' relative standings. that's admittedly a high standard, though, and at least some debates may have had more subtle impacts. debates have been held in 11 presidential races since 1960. we find just one after which the lead in presidential preference changed hands by a significant margin: in 1980, when ronald reagan uttered his "are you better off?" line. he gained 7 points in a post-debate poll. still, there are other cases in which debates (or post-debate evaluations) may have influenced campaign dynamics. debates are, after all, an essential window on the candidates’ styles and grasp of the issues. they can seem to add or reverse momentum. and polls are only so precise. consider 1960: after richard nixon’s pasty-faced performance, john f. kennedy went from 46 percent support to 49 percent in gallup data; nixon, from 47 percent to 46 percent. those changes were within the polls' margin of sampling error. nonetheless, the numerical "lead" switched, and collective memory maintains that the debates spelled nixon's narrow defeat. nor did gallup polls show significant movement immediately after the 1976 debate in which gerald ford said poland was free (and news reports pounced on the misstatement); jimmy carter gained a single point, ford lost 3. still, even if not measurably, the gaffe may have halted what had been a slide in carter's lead. then 73-year-old reagan's teasing jibe in 1984 about 56-year-old walter mondale's "youth and inexperience" didn't meaningfully change the numbers in abc news/washington post polls, but perhaps helped put aside questions about reagan's age and acuity. in 2000, al gore's wonk-heavy performance saw him go in at +2 and leave at -3, but again, that was within sampling error. there's also the question of missed opportunities, as in mike dukakis' bloodless answer, in 1988, to what he'd do if his wife were raped and murdered. he didn't seize on the chance to show a non-technocratic side. and abc/post polls did not meaningfully move. abc news/washington post polls in 1996, 2004, 2008 and 2012 also showed no significant movement around the debates. in 1992 there was more movement, including a significant gain for ross perot, but never enough to change bill clinton’s advantage. in instant reactions, at least, polling has found that debates typically reinforce preconceived notions rather than change them. most of each candidates' supporters say it's their candidate who won, and precious few say their minds were changed. but post-debate evaluations can shift. in 1992, right after the first debate, 24 percent of viewers said perot had won. by the next night, amid positive reviews of perot's performance, that grew to 37 percent among people who'd watched, heard or read about it. and perot's support did advance, from 6 percent before the debates to 17 percent after them. that shift may have been real, but it also may have reflected the challenges of immediate post-debate reaction polls. conducted in mere minutes, among individuals pre-recruited to participate, they're subject to considerable sampling and weighting limitations. further, some ask who "won," others who "did the better job"; some accept "tie" as an answer and some don't. instant reactions also bypass the role of considered judgment. hard as it may be to believe in the twitter age, sometimes people actually need a little while to think about things. the clearest response to the debates this year may take some days to emerge.  here's a rundown of the measurable debate effect (or lack thereof) in each election since 1960. there were no debates in 1964, 1968 or 1972. click here for data tables associated with each election. 1960: gallup had nixon +1, but that was 12 days before the first debate; it had kennedy +3 after it. twelve days is a long time and 4 points is a small number. gallup didn't poll between the remaining three debates, but showed kennedy +4 after the last one. 1976: news reports jumped on ford's misstatement of soviet domination of eastern europe in the second debate. carter's lead had been diminishing, and that did stop after this debate. but the measured change after the second debate was tiny -- carter gained 1 point, ford lost 3. 1980: this one looks to have mattered: gallup's pre-debate poll had carter +8; post-debate, reagan +3. (john anderson did not participate.) 1984: mondale crept up, but reagan stayed ahead by double digits nonetheless. 1988: we don't have an abc poll done right before the first debate; in a gallup poll it was george h. w. bush +8. our poll after the second debate showed no meaningful movement. 1992: perot moved up 5 points in abc news polling after the first debate and 4 points after the third debate. before the debates he had 6 percent support; after the last debate he was up to 17 percent. clinton moved up by 5 points after the second debate, bush down by 6, then clinton down by 6 after the third. but clinton led throughout. 1996: the race looked perhaps slightly tighter after the second debate, but clinton maintained a double-digit lead throughout. 2000: gore went in +2 and came out -3 -– a change of lead, but within sampling error. and a week after the last debate it was back to a dead heat, 47-47 percent. 2004: there were some wiggles in the debate period –- a 6-point lead for george w. bush before the first debate was a dead heat before the third -– but when all was said and done the race after the debates looked a lot like the race before them. 2008: the main shift in vote preference came before the first debate, as obama seized the reins of economic discontent after the failure of lehman brothers in mid-september. mccain's +2 in early september, just after the gop convention, proved to be his best. the race shifted to obama +9 in an abc/post poll completed sept. 22, four days before the first debate. obama never trailed again. 2012: obama was +2 ahead of the first debate in abc/post polls, within the margin of sampling error, +3 after the second debate and -1 after the final debate, all within sampling error.      the impact of debates? it's debatable      
__label__0 as police today captured the man wanted for questioning in connection to a series of explosive devices in new york city and new jersey, new information about him has begun to emerge. the man, ahmad khan rahami, 28, was born in 1988 in afghanistan and is a naturalized u.s. citizen, according to the fbi. he was discovered and captured in linden, new jersey, not far from his last known address in elizabeth.       a u.s. official initially told abc news rahami came to the u.s. in 2000, but his father later said the family came over in 1995. court records indicate ahmad rahami was from a large family and may have as many as seven siblings. former classmates said he attended edison high school in new jersey. one of them, chris konya, said rahami was quiet but funny and a "pretty normal guy." konya and another former classmate said rahami had a child with his high school girlfriend. rahami was enrolled at middlesex county college from fall of 2010 to fall of 2012, where he worked toward an associate's degree in criminal justice but did not graduate, according to school officials.   the rahami family owned a fried chicken restaurant in elizabeth. an employee and a recent customer said rahami worked there. "i come in here every week or two, just to get something to eat," local resident ryan mccann told the associated press. "he's always in there. he's a very friendly guy. that's what's so scary. it's hard when it's home." members of the rahami family apparently did not get along well with the local police and sued several officers in 2011 for allegedly harassing them over purported violations related the restaurant's operation. the case was dismissed in 2012, pending the resolution of a related legal matter, according to documents. investigators are poring over rahami's past travel, including what may have been a recent nearly year-long trip in which he flew to quetta, pakistan in april 2013 and returned to the u.s. through the united arab emirates in march 2014, according to the u.s. official. rahami reported to authorities that he was visiting his wife and family, who he said were afghan refugees living in quetta, and that he had traveled by car between pakistan and afghanistan.   in august 2014 rahami was arrested after allegedly stabbing someone in the leg, according to court documents. a complaint filed by a police officer said the officer "has reason to believe that the person is a danger to himself, others or property," but rahami was not indicted. today rahami was shot at least once by police during an exchange of gunfire before he was captured and then taken to a local hospital, authorities said. he is not cooperating with investigators, even so far as refusing to give his name, according to a source briefed on the case. officials said they have not determined a motive for the attacks. late monday officials announced charges against rahami related to the shootout with police: five counts of attempted murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. bail has been set at $5.2 million. it is unclear if rahami has an attorney. a senior afghan official told abc news the afghan government is ready to assist the u.s. in any way it can and is searching for any information it may have on rahami.   abc news' cindy galli, megan christie, randy kreider, alex hosenball and cho park contributed to this report. [editor's note sept. 28, 2016: the original version of this report said that ahmad rahami came to the u.s. in 2000. rahami's father later told abc news, however, that his son and the family came in 1995 and that rahami received his green card in 2000.]      details emerge about nyc bomb suspect ahmad khan rahami      
__label__0 one day after explosive devices were discovered in the manhattan neighborhood of chelsea and in seaside park and elizabeth in new jersey, republican nominee donald trump repeated his calls to implement police profiling to stop more attacks in the united states. "our local police, they know who a lot of these people are. they are afraid to do anything about it because they don't want to be accused of profiling and they don't want to be accused of all sorts of things," trump said on "fox and friends" when asked what policies he would implement as president to "get tough" on terrorism. he argued that the country had no other choice but to follow the lead of israel. "israel has done an unbelievable job, and they will profile. they profile. they see somebody that's suspicious," he said, "they will profile. they will take that person in and check out. do we have a choice? look what's going on. do we really have a choice? we're trying to be so politically correct in our country, and this is only going to get worse." trump previously made similar comments. after the orlando nightclub shooting in june, he said in an interview on "face the nation" that it was something the u.s. needed to seriously consider.      donald trump repeats calls for police profiling after nyc area explosions      
__label__0 ahmad khan rahami, earlier named a person of interest in the weekend explosions in new york city and new jersey, has been charged with five counts of attempted murder of a law enforcement officer. he is also charged with second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. rahami was taken into custody and hospitalized this morning after a shootout with police in linden, new jersey, the union county acting prosecutor said today. he has been "directly linked" to the devices used in the new york and new jersey explosions on saturday, fbi official bill sweeney said. new york city mayor bill de blasio said this afternoon there is "every reason to believe this was an act of terror." but there is "no indication that there is a cell operating in the area or in the city," sweeney said, adding that "the investigation is ongoing." "we will continue to conduct investigative activity to ensure we completely understand rahami's social network," sweeney said. "for that reason, i do not plan to answer specific questions about our techniques, or our knowledge of the devices." rahami was taken into custody in linden, about 4 miles south of elizabeth, after being injured in the altercation, during which a responding officer was shot in his bulletproof vest and second officer was injured.   rahami was taken to a hospital in newark, where he is undergoing surgery, said grace park, the union county acting prosecutor. the extent of his injuries was not immediately clear. the confrontation happened at about 10:30 a.m., when an owner of a linden bar reported that someone was sleeping in a hallway of his establishment, linden mayor derek armstead told abc new york station wabc. the bar owner, harry bains, told abc station wabc in an exclusive interview that "it was my gut reaction" to call the police. armstead said, "one of our police officers went to investigate and to wake him up and realized that he was [rahami], the suspect that had been being sought in the bombings." "he realized it was the suspect, and within moments, the suspect fired on him," armstead said. "and thank god that he had his vest on. and i think that was very helpful for him. i think that saved his life."   president barack obama said this afternoon that he spoke on the phone with the officers who apprehended rahami. "they are going to be fine, they sustained some modest injuries but ones that they’ll rapidly recover from," obama said. "they were in good spirits and i communicated to them of how appreciative the american people are." a source briefed on the investigation said agents are searching for other people they want to talk to and that the investigation is not over. an alert sent shortly before 8 a.m. today said police were seeking a man in connection with the saturday night bombing in manhattan's chelsea neighborhood -- identified by authorities as rahami, 28. he is believed to be the man seen in surveillance video at both the scene of the explosion on west 23rd street and on west 27th street, where the unexploded device was found, a police source said.   his last known address was in elizabeth, new jersey. the address of a home searched by fbi agents in elizabeth this morning is linked to a person with a similar name. rahami is a u.s. citizen of afghan descent.         sources said authorities believe the three bombs -- one exploding in an oceanfront town on the new jersey shore, one in manhattan and another in elizabeth, a town bordering newark international airport, just beyond new york city's borders -- are related. sweeney said today the explosion in elizabeth is still under investigation.   the explosions did not cause any fatalities, but the chelsea explosion injured 29 people. the incident have put residents, police and other security personnel on high alert. de blasio, on "good morning america" today, praised the nypd's response to the threat and said the department has "the largest anti-terror force of any police force in the country." the latest incident was sunday night in elizabeth, about 15 miles southwest of the chelsea neighborhood in manhattan. police recovered five possible homemade pipe bombs in a backpack, and one device exploded early today as a police robot attempted to disarm it. the fbi's newark office tweeted that its bomb technicians had responded to the scene, along with investigators from union county and the state police of new jersey. no one was injured.   the manhattan blast took place on west 23rd street around 8:30 p.m. saturday and injured 29 people. all the injured have been released from hospitals, mayor de blasio said.    new york gov. andrew cuomo told reporters sunday night there was no evidence of international involvement. but he said today he considers the explosion an act of terrorism. "i believe it was an act of terrorism," he said. "i believe you set off a bomb and you try to set off a second bomb, that is an appearance of trying to intimidate new yorkers." he added, "yesterday there was no hint of any connection to foreigner terrorism." "no group had taken accountability. no group had put out a statement. it was very early in the investigation. it still is early. but there may very well turn out to be a link to foreign terrorist organizations," he said. "we will find that out today or in the coming days."     new jersey sen. bob menendez called the incidents "clearly an act of terrorism." in the search after the chelsea explosion, officials found a possible second device on 27th street, said james o'neill, the city's police commissioner. the second device, described as a pressure cooker, was removed and did not explode. the first incident of the weekend was saturday morning, when an apparent improvised explosive device was set off in seaside park, new jersey, a beach town about 90 miles south of new york city. the device went off along the route of a planned 5k charity race to benefit u.s. marines and sailors. because of delays with the start of the run, the explosion occurred before many people were nearby.   officials announced late sunday night the detention of up to five individuals in connection with saturday night's explosion in chelsea. no charges were made, and the individuals are no longer in custody, the fbi's sweeney said today. "i'm not going to discuss what they could face in the potential future," he said. as the investigations continue, officials in new york city are preparing to host heads of government from around the world at the annual united nations general assembly this week in manhattan. president obama is among the speakers. abc news' j.j. gallagher and michael edison hayden contributed to this report.      ny, nj bombings suspect charged with attempted murder of cops      
__label__0 donald trump's surrogates and leading supporters on sunday were pushing a narrative that the republican candidate started two days earlier when he declared that hillary clinton's 2008 campaign "started the birther controversy," meaning the false notion that president obama was born outside the united states. on cbs news’ face the nation on sunday, trump campaign manager kellyanne conway pushed the claim that so-called "birtherism" began with the clinton 2008 campaign by invoking the words of former clinton campaign manager patti sollis doyle. “even patti solis doyle, who was hillary clinton's campaign manager in 2008 ... until she was fired by hillary clinton, admitted on friday ... that she said, yes, these are her words: there was a volunteer in iowa who was pushing this,” conway said. sollis doyle, in an interview on cnn, said a volunteer coordinator had forwarded an email promoting the birther conspiracy. but she said that person was immediately fired and that the birther conspiracy theory was never promoted by clinton herself.     conway also mentioned a memo circulated by mark penn when he was chief strategist for clinton’s 2008 campaign that talked about obama’s lack of american roots. penn wrote a memo in 2007 saying that obama’s foreign background could present a weakness for him and that clinton should emphasize her middle-class midwestern upbringing. "his roots to american values and culture are at best limited," the memo says. "i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and values." but it does not say that obama was foreign-born. new jersey gov. chris christie, a prominent trump supporter, also invoked sollis doyle’s comments and then downplayed trump's role in promoting the idea that obama wasn't born in the u.s. "it's not true that he kept it up for five years,” christie said on cnn’s “state of the union.” “it wasn't like he was talking about it on a regular basis." similarly, republican national committee chairman reince priebus in an interview on "face the nation" said he thinks the "birther" movement "was something that got started in the 2008 presidential campaign ... by the preponderance of evidence before us, hillary clinton, or her campaign, were definitely involved in this issue." trump himself gave a short statement on friday morning, at an event under the glittering chandeliers of his newest hotel, in an attempt to reverse his long-held assertion that there is uncertainty surrounding the location of president obama's birth. “hillary clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. i finished it. i finished it. you know what i mean. president barack obama was born in the united states, period,” the republican presidential nominee said. trump's statement friday came just a day after he refused to acknowledge to the washington post that obama was born in the u.s. and for years, trump had helped perpetuate conspiracy theories about whether the first black president is wholly american and in fact born in hawaii -- as his public birth certificate says, an attack many, including clinton, have said is racially charged. in an august 2013 interview with abc news' jon karl, for example, trump stood behind his push to reveal obama's "true birth status." karl asked, "you don't acknowledge that you went overboard on this whole birther stuff?" trump replied, "actually, i think it made me very popular, if you want to know the truth, ok? so i do think i know what i'm doing."      trump surrogates push narrative that clinton started 'birtherism'      
__label__0 one woman was killed and several children were injured after airstrikes pounded the city of aleppo, according to residents and activists. on sunday, warplanes targeted the besieged syrian city for the first time since the cease-fire went into effect last week, according to the syrian observatory for human rights. the 52-year-old woman died after a wall fell on her after airstrikes on her house, according to abu rajab, a radiologist and managing director of the hospital where she was treated in aleppo's al-sakhur neighborhood. "she had a head injury and suffered suffocation," abu rajab, told abc news. four children were also treated at the hospital, he said. among them was a 15-year-old girl who had pieces of shrapnel in her chest. "she was experiencing severe pain and is still under observation at the hospital," abu rajab said. another child, a 3-year-old girl, was injured in the scalp and right hand. "we give children gifts to help them relax. i gave her a toy train so that she could play with it and forget her pain," abu rajab said, adding that the girl remains in the hospital. two other children, a 3-year-old and a 2-year-old, were treated at the hospital and have been discharged, according to abu rajab. "they had lighter wounds and stayed for one day," he said. "they had dust in their lungs and we gave them oxygen." the u.s.-russian-brokered cease-fire agreement was focused on reducing violence in the war-torn region and delivering humanitarian aid. the agreement had to be met before russia and the u.s. would work together to fight militant groups isis and al-nusra in syria. so far no aid has entered eastern aleppo, where up to 275,000 people live under siege, according to the united nations. two u.n. trucks carrying flour and food supplies that could feed around 185,000 people for one month are still parked by the turkish border, ready to go. "i am pained and disappointed that a united nations convoy has yet to cross into syria from turkey, and safely reach eastern aleppo, where up to 275,000 people remain trapped without food, water, proper shelter or medical care," stephen o’brien, u.n.'s undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, said in a statement today. "all parties must facilitate regular and sustained access to families in all the besieged and hard-to-reach areas across the country, through both cross-line and cross-border routes. the people of syria have suffered long enough. millions of syrian civilians continue to face horrific deprivation and violence, especially those trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas." aid workers have not been able to reach eastern aleppo since clashes between the syrian government and armed rebel groups started on july 7. around 13.5 million people in syria are in need of humanitarian assistance, while 4.8 million have fled their country and 6.1 million are internally displaced, according to this month's figures from the u.n.'s office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs.      1 woman killed, several children injured after airstrikes in aleppo      
__label__0 a syrian human rights group said today that at least 32 people had been killed and dozens injured in aleppo, syria, and its western suburbs in the hours after syria's military declared the u.s.-russian brokered cease-fire over. after the syrian military blamed rebels for not observing the truce, which was in its seventh day, the united nations said a convoy transporting aid to the hard-hit city had been attacked, with 18 of the convoy's 31 trucks initially believed to have been hit. the rights group, the syrian observatory for human rights, said that 12 people had been killed when the convoy was struck. farhan haq, a deputy spokesman for u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon, told abc news that he could not confirm any information on potential casualties or the cause of the attack. he said that the united nations' initial understanding was that a warehouse operated by the syrian arab red crescent had also been hit along with the convoy, before the trucks could distribute any aid to 78,000 people whom international groups had hoped to reach. the fighting came amid signs the cease-fire was falling apart, with russia casting doubt on it and the syrian military declaring its conclusion. but u.s. secretary of state john kerry, speaking to reporters in new york city, disputed the notion that the cease-fire had ended and redirected his frustrations toward the russians. "we have not had seven days of calm and delivery of humanitarian goods, and so it'd be good if they didn't talk first to the press but if they talked to the people who are actually negotiating this," kerry said. "and i think it's -- as i said yesterday -- time to end the grandstanding and time to do the real work of delivering on the humanitarian goods that are necessary for access. so we just began today to see real movement of humanitarian goods, and let's see where we are, and we're happy to have a good conversation with them about how to proceed." kerry is in new york city for the united nations general assembly, where international leaders will discuss the world's refugee crisis in a large part caused by the five-year syrian war. in a statement, state department spokesman john kirby stressed that the u.s. was waiting to hear from russia on the current state of the cease-fire. "while we have seen comments attributed to the syrian military, our arrangement is with russia, which is responsible for the syrian regime's compliance, so we expect russia to clarify their position," he said. before today's declaration by the syrian military, the cease-fire was already on shaky ground, with reports of violations on both sides. according to the syrian observatory for human rights, the besieged city of aleppo was hit by at least four airstrikes on sunday. the group also reported that convoys carrying humanitarian aid shipments had not received permission to enter the city, which desperately needs them. aleppo is home to nearly 2 million people who lack regular access to water and electricity. an estimated 250,000 to 275,000 people live in areas held by anti-government rebels that have been a focus of intense airstrikes and artillery bombardment.     additionally, on saturday the u.s.-led coalition fighting isis halted an airstrike in eastern syria that the russian defense ministry said killed 62 syrian government soldiers and injured 100 others. a u.s. defense official told abc news that the strike was supposed to target a collection of vehicles and personnel believed to belong to isis. the airstrike was halted after russia communicated to the coalition that it was syrian forces that were being struck. australia, denmark and the united kingdom have acknowledged that their aircraft participated in the strike. a senior obama administration official told abc news that the u.s. "relayed our regret" to the syrian government through russian officials. according to a u.s. defense official, the leading theory is that the syrian forces hit in the airstrike may have been conscripts or prisoners wearing civilian clothes, not regular syrian army uniforms. the cease-fire must be renewed every 48 hours. the last extension was on friday. abc news' luis martinez contributed to this report.      syrian military says us-russian brokered cease-fire over

"then there are the topics that are important but not needle movers -- like gentrification. from new york to los angeles, the poor are being pushed out by rising rents and property taxes as developers reshape neighborhoods. nestled in the shadows of the 'detroit's recovery' narrative is the question of 'what will detroit look like when it's over?' take a look at harlem: beautiful, yet void of the people and the history that made it an essential piece of americana. detroit is progressing toward that same fate and yet it cannot stay where it was. solving this riddle is as important as creating jobs, whether it is on the news or not.” dowd: “it's our birthplace and what formed us to a large degree as we went into our respective professions. detroit really is the story of america. from modest beginnings on the frontier, to terrific economic growth from industrial revolution through mass production. headquarters of the automobile, which symbolizes the freedom american's love. and the building of the middle class which really forms america in its unique position. and through the fall of detroit because of loss of manufacturing, broken political governmental and corporate institutions. and now, rebuilding detroit in whole new ways is taking place across america through entrepreneurs and innovation.”  "we are at a point of incredible disruption in all our institutions. and there is fear that our democracy might be broken and we can't do the things that need to be done. with two major party leaders distrusted and disliked by a majority of the country, and americans facing this choice in a few weeks.” granderson: “politically michigan is an important state and detroit an important city because it really does capture the rural versus urban vote that can be found in numerous states. there is miami and then there is florida. there is chicago and then illinois. there is detroit, then there are huge chunks of the state that couldn't be more different. those differences are what both candidates are banking on and is a reason why neither is liked." "honestly this cultural division has been going on for some time. perhaps it's the personalities of the two doing the dividing that makes this year's campaign season particularly distasteful. but detroit, a city that is 90 percent black, voted for a white mayor for the first time in decades. so once again detroit can show the nation what happens when voters actively decide to shake up the status quo in the name of salvation.”   jessica care moore | poet, detroit advocate ron fournier | associate publisher, crain’s business detroit peter cummings | real estate developer angie reyes | executive director, detroit hispanic development corp yusef shakur | neighborhood activist khaled beydoun associate professor, university of detroit mercy law fatina abdrabboh | director, american arab anti-discrimination committee in dearborn chuck stokes | editorial & public affairs director, wxyz-tv ashley mcguire | senior fellow, the catholic association ‘strait talk with matt & lz’ will be streamed live on abcnews.com and on abc news’ apps on mobile and ott as well as abc news’ facebook page. launched in september 2015, “strait talk with matt & lz” is an original livestream series on politics and culture, hosted by abc news political contributors matthew dowd and lz granderson. with over 30 shows to date, dowd and granderson host “strait talk” from abc news headquarters in new york and have brought the show to cities across the u.s, including los angeles, austin and detroit as well as manchester for both of abc news’ primary debates and cleveland and philadelphia for the 2016 conventions.

__label__0 president barack obama characterized donald trump's presidential campaign as an "infomercial" during a fundraiser in manhattan sunday night. in town for this week's united nations general assembly, obama spoke to supporters at the gramercy park home of restaurateur danny meyer and his wife audrey. "this guy's unqualified to be president and he shows no interest in even gaining the rudimentary knowledge required to make really hard decisions on a day to day basis," obama said of the republican presidential candidate. "there's no curiosity. there's no desire to get up to speed. it's a infomercial. it's a reality show." trump previously appeared on several seasons of nbc's reality show, "the apprentice," and he has also lent his name to several products over the course of his career, including menswear, alcohol, magazines and hotels. and in a nod to trump's comments and policies that have been slammed by critics as racist and xenophobic, obama said, "it's tapping into some of our worst impulses ... one's that divide us rather then bring us together. one's that seek to put down people who have been historically vulnerable opposed to lifting them up." obama admitted that presidential race will be a close race, explaining, "so this should not be a close election but it will be and the reason it will be is not because of hillary's flaws but rather because structurally we've become a very polarized society and if all you're doing is watching fox news and listening to rush limbaugh... a lot of misinformation on a regular basis, it's very hard for you to think that you're going to vote for somebody who you've been told is taking the country in the wrong direction." the president also acknowledge that americans are still trying to come to terms with having a female president. "i will also say that there's a reason why we haven't had a women president... as a society we still grapple with what it means to see powerful women. and it still troubles us in a lot of ways unfairly. and that expresses itself in all sorts of ways."       obama describes trump's presidential run as an 'infomercial' and 'reality show'      
__label__0 rose pak, a brash and lively community activist who helped transform san francisco's growing asian american population into a politically powerful constituency during an era when few women carried such clout, has died. she was 68. pak died of natural causes in her home sunday morning. friends and family said she seemed healthy after spending several months in china after a kidney transplant, the san francisco chronicle reported monday (http://bit.ly/2d22ere). pak never held elective office, but as the longtime consultant to the chinese chamber of commerce, she helped raise money for preferred politicians and backed projects that benefited chinatown's residents. she hated being called a power broker. "if i was white, they'd call me a civic leader." in 2011, pak started a campaign that led to ed lee becoming the city's first chinese american mayor. she would later call him an enormous disappointment. "she was strong and fearless," lee told the chronicle. "whether she was right or wrong, she grounded herself in representing the community. she really wanted to make sure chinatown as a whole was respected." pak was born in hunan, china, and fled to hong kong with her family as a child. she arrived in san francisco in 1967, became a reporter for the chronicle and covered the community she would later champion. she was such an aggressive reporter that a lawyer ended up in court on battery charges after throwing a punch at park during an interview. the lawyer called her "an enormously pushy person." pak countered that she "was trained to be persistent." pak became an advocate as she became immersed in issues concerning the neighborhood. in the 1970s, she helped save chinatown's chinese hospital, an underfunded medical center for cantonese-speaking poor. a few years ago, she took over efforts to raise more than $100 million to rebuild the facility. "i don't know if i'm the best person, but someone had to do it," she said, according to the newspaper. pak was such an institution that 300 people, including lt. gov. and former san francisco mayor gavin newsom, were on hand in may at san francisco's airport to greet her when she returned from china. she told the crowd that her doctor said she could live another 40 years. pak said she only needed 15, including 10 to rebuild a housing complex in chinatown and five "to get even with the people who wished me dead."      influential san francisco activist rose pak dies at 68      
__label__0 one of the victims wounded in a stabbing at a central minnesota mall says the man who carried out the attack showed no emotion and his eyes looked blank. ryan schliep, one of 10 people who suffered wounds that were not life-threatening before the attacker was fatally shot, told wcco-tv that the man "just walked right at me" before striking quickly and penetrating the skin of his scalp. "he looked just blank in the eyes like he wasn't even there," schliep said shortly before being released from a st. cloud hospital. authorities are treating saturday's stabbings at crossroads center mall as a possible act of terrorism, in part because an islamic state-run news agency claimed that the attacker was a "soldier of the islamic state" who had heeded the group's calls for attacks in countries that are part of a u.s.-led anti-is coalition. but it wasn't immediately known whether the extremist group had planned the attack or knew about it beforehand. st. cloud police chief blair anderson said monday the attack appeared to be the work of a single individual and there was no sign that the attacker, identified as 20-year-old dahir adan, was radicalized or communicated with any terrorist group. president barack obama said the stabbings had no apparent connection to weekend bombings in new york and new jersey. because adan was somali, leaders of the state's large somali community acknowledged the prospect of a "long winter" for their people after the stabbings, but warned not to quickly accept the terrorism connection. "we cannot give isis and other terrorist organizations more air time and propaganda without real facts," said jaylani hussein, executive director of the council on american-islamic relations' minnesota chapter. little is known about adan, who was identified sunday by his father, ahmed adan, and then by st. cloud police monday night. he had only a traffic ticket on his record, was apparently out of work after his job as a part-time security guard ended and hadn't enrolled in college since the spring semester. adan was wearing a security guard's uniform during the attack. a spokesman for the family, abdi wahid osman, read from a statement expressing condolences for the injured and anyone else who was impacted. "as we mourn the death of our son, dahir adan, who was very dear to us, we are in deep shock as everyone else is in the state of minnesota," the statement said. federal officials released no new information monday on the investigation into the stabbing, which was stopped by an off-duty police officer just minutes into it. fbi special agent in charge rick thornton has said authorities were digging into adan's background and possible motives, looking at social media accounts and electronic devices and talking to people he knew. minnesota has the nation's largest somali population, an estimated 57,000 people. both anderson and gov. mark dayton warned against a possible backlash due to the stabbings, especially in st. cloud, where somalis in the 65,000-resident city about 65 miles (104 km) northwest of minneapolis have spoken about mistreatment in the past. "i implore the citizens of st. cloud and the citizens of minnesota to rise above this incident and remember our common humanity," dayton said. "it's going to be tough times. we know it's going to be a long winter for this community," said haji yusuf, who is part of unitecloud, a local group founded to tackle racial and ethnic tension in the city. last year, st. cloud school officials met with somali parents, community elders and students after somali-american students walked out to protest their treatment. one student had said somali-americans were called islamic state members and had their headscarves pulled off, and a photo posted on social media of a somali-american student who was using a wheelchair after breaking her leg with a caption that said she was "disabled in isis." five years earlier, cair's minnesota chapter asked for a federal civil rights investigation into allegations that muslim students had been harassed at two st. cloud high schools. a 2011 agreement resolved the case, but the u.s. department of education still was monitoring the case last year. in 2013, cair called on police in nearby waite park to reject a training program about somalis because a flier unfairly suggested the activities of al-shabab — a militant group in east africa that has had success in recruiting somali-americans in minnesota — are supported by most muslims. if the stabbings are ultimately deemed a terrorist act, it would be the first carried out by a somali on u.s. soil. adan was employed by the security firm securitas, and was assigned for a few months to an electrolux factory near the mall, electrolux spokeswoman eloise hale said. his father, speaking through an interpreter, told the minneapolis star tribune that he was 22, but court records and a driver's license database showed his age as 20. police also said he was 20. a spokesman for st. cloud state university confirmed that adan was a student majoring in information systems, but hadn't enrolled since the spring semester. yusuf, who has spoken with adan's parents, said adan went to the mall to pick up an iphone. yusuf said adan seemed happy when left the home, which was the last time his parents saw him. a person at the t-mobile store where yusuf said adan had gone declined to comment or take a message for his supervisor. five minutes after authorities received the first 911 call, jason falconer, a part-time officer in the city of avon who was there shopping, began shooting the attacker as he was lunging at him with the knife, anderson said, and continued to engage him as the attacker got up three times. avon police chief corey nellis said monday that falconer owns a firing range and is the city's firearms instructor. "if i was going to ask anybody to fire ... live rounds in a crowded mall, i would trust his abilities next to anybody's," nellis said. the mall reopened monday after being closed sunday. ——— forliti reported from minneapolis. associated press writers steve karnowski and john mone contributed to this report from st. cloud, minnesota, and jeff baenen contributed from minneapolis. ——— this story has been corrected to show that the electrolux facility is near, but not in the crossroads center mall at st. cloud. it also has been corrected to reflect that adan's age to 20, rather than 22, and to reflect that yusuf's group is unitecloud, rather than onecloud.      victim: mall attacker emotionless; leaders urge 'rise above'      
__label__0 a federal prosecutor told jurors on monday that a witness will testify that republican gov. chris christie was told about a plan to close traffic lanes near the george washington bridge as part of a political vendetta while the shutdown was happening, a claim christie has contested for years. the trial comes three years after gridlock paralyzed a town next to the busy bridge, which connects new jersey and new york city, for four days. prosecutors said two former christie allies, bill baroni and bridget kelly, had sought political revenge against democratic fort lee mayor mark sokolich, who didn't endorse christie for re-election. baroni was a top christie appointee to the port authority of new york and new jersey, which runs area bridges, tunnels and transit hubs. kelly was christie's former deputy chief of staff. assistant u.s. attorney vikas khanna told jurors that another port authority official, david wildstein, who pleaded guilty in connection with the scandal last year, will testify he and baroni made christie aware of the plan during a sept. 11 memorial in new york in 2013, three days after the gridlock started. "the evidence will show that ... they bragged about the fact that there were traffic problems in fort lee and that mayor sokolich was not getting his calls returned," khanna said. christie has denied knowing about the scheme until well after it was carried out, and a taxpayer-funded report he commissioned absolved him of wrongdoing. he wasn't charged in the federal investigation. a message left at his office seeking comment wasn't immediately returned monday. christie, an unsuccessful candidate for the 2016 republican presidential nomination, conceded last week that the bridge scandal was a factor in gop nominee donald trump's not picking him as a running mate. defense attorneys spent considerable time in their opening statements castigating wildstein, a former political blogger and high school classmate of christie who they called the governor's hatchet man at the port authority. they characterized him as a vulgar, power-smitten opportunist aiming to ride christie's coattails to washington, d.c., at a time when christie, about to easily win re-election in his heavily democratic state, was seen as a top presidential hopeful. kelly's attorney, michael critchley, called wildstein and others in christie's inner circle "cowards who were addicted to power" and said kelly, who had been deputy chief of staff for three months at the time of the lane closures, was a sacrificial lamb. "the idea that bridget kelly is directing the affairs of the state of new jersey is almost laughable," he said. "they wanted to throw her, in some sense, under the presidential bus." baroni's lawyer, michael baldassare, called wildstein a liar and "a horrible person, a vindictive individual who would destroy your life." in the government's opening, khanna described how crushing gridlock engulfed fort lee on four days beginning sept. 9, 2013, and how the defendants ignored sokolich's texts, emails and voicemails seeking help. kelly's "time for some traffic problems in fort lee" email to wildstein was sent aug. 13, 2013, a day after she was notified sokolich wouldn't endorse christie, khanna said. he added that although the lane realignment was wildstein's idea, wildstein "will also tell you kelly instructed him to take that action and baroni blessed it. and the three of them worked hand in hand." critchley, kelly's attorney, said kelly regretted sending the email but it was merely joking banter taken out of context. he told jurors kelly believed wildstein's proffer that the three access lanes from fort lee to the bridge were part of a "corrupt political deal" years ago and should be re-examined. baroni and kelly face counts of wire fraud, conspiracy, deprivation of civil rights and misusing an organization receiving federal funds, the port authority. the most serious charge in the indictment, wire fraud conspiracy, carries a maximum 20-year prison term upon conviction. witness testimony is scheduled to begin tuesday, with fort lee's police chief. ——— this story has been corrected to show that kelly was former deputy chief of staff, not chief of staff.      prosecutor: gov. christie was told about plan to close lanes      
__label__0 the recent connected bombings in new york and new jersey and the stabbing attack at a mall in minnesota have increased interest in how the presidential candidates would handle national security. hillary clinton and donald trump have spoken out since the attacks, which left dozens of people injured. john cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the department of homeland security, said he believes that the terrorist attacks that have occurred during the campaign "have a significant impact" on voters. "when events occur like this ... you tend to have people become more fearful, and when people are more fearful, they tend to gravitate towards a candidate who appears to be more strong," said cohen, who currently works as an abc news consultant. three of the latest national polls — all conducted before the attacks this weekend — had clinton leading when respondents were asked whom they trust to handle the issue of terrorism.     in an abc news/washington post poll released sept. 11, clinton led, 50 percent to trump's 41 percent among all adults and 48 percent to trump's 45 percent among likely voters when asked about who was more trusted to handle terrorism. a cbs/new york times poll released sept. 14 had clinton doing "a better job handling terrorism and national security" according to 49 percent of respondents, compared with trump's 45 percent. the split was closest in a quinnipiac poll released sept. 15, in which respondents were asked who they thought would do a better job keeping the country safe from terrorism, "regardless of how you intend to vote." in that poll, clinton got 49 percent to trump's 47 percent. "traditionally, it's been the republican party who has projected strength and awareness in the area of law enforcement and homeland security, but today that's kind of flipped because, despite his rhetoric, there are a number of national security experts who have raised concerns about the level of understanding that donald trump has as it relates to terrorism and national security threats," cohen said.   current events are factoring into the political campaigns, with the candidates scheduling speeches about national security in the wake of attacks. but cohen said political rhetoric could also be affecting and even motivating the attacks themselves. he said trump's rhetoric and calls to bar foreign muslims from entering the united states "may even serve to further along those who are becoming inspired to act on [isis'] behalf." james campbell, a professor of political science at the university at buffalo in new york who has written a book about political polarization, told abc news that he believes the attacks translate to a potential advantage for trump. "i have to think that terrorist events in this country help trump and hurt clinton. for these events to be occurring with the frequency they do may be read by many as a failure of the current administration and particularly its foreign policy team to effectively deal with the problem," he said. "it may also suggest that we need a tougher approach to dealing with terrorism, an approach associated with trump. when suspects are identified who have muslim-sounding names, then that may further fuel support for tougher immigration standards and scrutiny," campbell added.      terrorist attacks will likely affect 2016 presidential race, experts say      
__label__0 ivanka trump met privately with house speaker paul ryan, r-wisconsin, monday in new york city, sources confirmed to abc news. trump, who requested the meeting, attended ryan's speech at the economic club of new york before the two had a scheduled meeting.     ryan shared some of his experiences from the 2012 presidential campaign trail and trump provided ryan with an update on her father's presidential campaign, according to a source. ryan has not crossed paths with trump or his family since the republican national convention. he has been running a parallel election-year campaign touting the house gop "better way" policy agenda and raising money for republicans in the house and senate, setting fundraising records. last week, he suggested trump should release his tax returns. ivanka trump, who is one of her father's closest confidantes, has kept in touch with hill republicans throughout the presidential campaign on policy issues. she also joined her father in washington, d.c. for his meetings with house and senate republicans in early july.

__label__0 in this final stretch before election day, the clinton camp is setting its sights on the youth. the democratic presidential nominee today held a millennial-focused campaign event at temple university in philadelphia, where she made her pitch to the voting bloc that has been unwilling to fully rally behind her. "even if you are totally opposed to donald trump, you may still have some questions about me. i get that," clinton, in a moment of self-reflection, told the crowd of 300 people. "and i want to do my best to answer those questions.” she explained that the “service” part of “public service” has always been easier for her than the “public” part. “i will never be the showman my opponent is and, you know what, that's ok with me,” she said, referring to donald trump.       over the past week, the clinton campaign has redoubled its efforts to attract millennials, whom demographers define loosely as people born in the early-1980s through the early-2000s. clinton surrogates president obama, first lady michelle obama, sen. bernie sanders of vermont and sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts have all been tapped to hit the trail. the main focus: urging young people to vote. “we need everyone off the sidelines,” clinton said today. “not voting is not an option. that just plays into trump’s hands, it really does.” clinton, who started her remarks calling on the country to “remain vigilant” in the wake of the bombings in new york and new jersey, also used the opportunity to contrast herself with her republican opponent. "you want something to vote for, not just against," she told the crowd. “optimism, not resentment. answers, not anger. ideas, not insults. bridges, not walls. “you're also here because you know this election isn't a reality-tv show. it shouldn't be about birth certificates or name calling or stunts to get on the cable news,” she added, referencing trump’s long-held and false belief that obama was born outside the united states. “this election comes down to a choice between two very different visions for america,” she concluded. trump has since said that he believes obama was born in the united states. although clinton is polling better with young adults than trump (a recent abc news/washington post poll found that she has 40 percent support among youth versus trump’s 28 percent), the demographic, as a whole, has shown less enthusiasm for her candidacy than other democrats. according to that same poll, 60 percent of democratic adults under the age of 30 said they had hoped sanders would win their party’s nomination, while 26 percent said clinton. that number, however, is better than it was four months ago. (during the primary in spring, 75 percent of democrats under the age of 30 supported sanders, while only 25 percent said they supported clinton, according to the abc news/washington post poll.) clinton campaign officials, who hope to close that gap further, say they plan to continue these outreach efforts throughout the rest of the campaign. "the millennial generation is a key voting bloc in this election and it's clear that the campaign must do more to earn their vote,” clinton spokesman jennifer palmieri said in a statement today. “that is why the campaign has recently ramped up efforts to engage millennial voters through a stretch of events with surrogates like president obama, first lady michelle obama, senator tim kaine, anne holton, chelsea clinton, senator elizabeth warren and senator bernie sanders. “the campaign has also brought on board staff at headquarters and in states to organize and mobilize millennial voters,” she added. “and over the coming weeks, the campaign will continue to host discussions in communities on how hillary clinton is fighting for them.” abc news’ ryan struyk contributed to this report.      hillary clinton accepts that millennial voters still have 'questions about me'      
__label__0 today marks the one-week mark ahead of the first of the three presidential debates during the 2016 campaign and the candidates are gearing up. the commission on presidential debates announced today the broad topics that are slated to be covered during the first debate: america's direction, achieving prosperity and securing america. the topics were selected by the moderator, lester holt of "nbc nightly news," but are "subject to possible changes because of news developments." the commission also made its final decision on friday that there would only be two candidates taking the debate stage on monday, sept. 26. it ruled that neither libertarian party nominee gary johnson nor green party nominee jill stein had met the 15 percent mark in a combination of polls, which had previously been set as the bar for participation qualification.       before republican nominee donald trump and democratic nominee clinton head to hofstra university, the site of the first debate, the candidates and their campaign aides have started teasing their debate prep strategies. trump started his debate prep in late august, and at the time, sources told abc news that he hadn't participated in mock debates, which is one of the more typical prep strategies for presidential candidates. as for trump's personal debate strategy, he hasn't talked about the specifics of his game plan, focusing more on how he will deal with facing one opponent head on. "i will treat her with great respect unless she treats me in a certain manner, in which case that will be the end of that," trump said about clinton last week during an appearance on sean hannity's fox news show. "but i'm certainly starting off with the feeling that i'm going to treat her with great respect. i hope we can talk about policy and certain things. i am not looking to go in and treat her with disrespect." clinton's press secretary brian fallon told msnbc last thursday that she won't "go in there seeking to provoke donald trump." "she's going to do what she always does which shows she got the grasp of the issue and the command and poise of being commandeering chief. that contrast there will speak for itself," fallon said.      the first presidential debate is just a week away      
__label__0 russian president vladimir putin’s party has won national parliamentary elections with a significantly increased majority, a result that cements putin's total control over the country's political life and which potentially grants him the ability to change russia's constitution. with 93% of the vote counted, the party, united russia, was shown to have taken 343 of 450 seats in the lower house of parliament, a sizable increase on its previous 238 seats. the vote was marked by an exceptionally low turnout of just 40 percent, illustrating a sense among many russians that the election was of little importance in a country where the kremlin determines all major policy decisions and elections are seen as stage-managed.   russia’s communist party came a close third, while the anti-putin opposition failed to break the 5% barrier to enter parliament, losing its only lawmaker there. the win gives united russia a two-thirds majority that allows it to amend the constitution. united russia's head, prime minister dmitry medvedev declared victory and putin congratulated the party, saying it showed "political maturity" among russians. the outcome was not surprising. with the country strongly behind putin -- whose approval ratings stand around 80 percent -- and the opposition effectively sidelined, the vote had been described by some observers as the “dullest” election in russian history. the only surprise was the scale of united russia's win, overcoming polls suggesting it would have a poor showing. that was in stark contrast to the last time russians voted for their parliament in 2011, when significant vote-rigging prompted huge street protests. tens of thousands marched in moscow demanding putin’s resignation in what was the biggest popular challenge to his rule that the russian leader has faced. such upheavals seem now all but impossible, underlining the vivid shift in russia’s political atmosphere since then. eager to avoid a repeat of 2011’s trouble, this time the kremlin has sought to create an impression that the vote would be clean. it removed the head of russia’s elections commission -- pejoratively nicknamed the “wizard” for his ability to make the numbers add up in putin’s favor, and replacing him with a respected human rights defender. confident the country’s beleaguered opposition was without traction among the public, authorities had also opened up a small breathing space for them during the elections allowing them to field more candidates and to take part in tv debates. those moves led many to predict the elections would not see significant amounts of voting fraud. with popular sentiment aggressively pro-putin and most russians convinced of the impossibility of political change, there appeared little need for vote rigging. how true that was was still being debated on monday. following the vote across russia's 11 time zones, it was clear that the vote had been far from pristine, with growing reports of cheating and numerous videos appearing to show ballot-stuffing, but there were few claims that the violations had had any decisive impact. while threatening to annul some results where cheating was recorded, the head of russia’s elections commission, ella pamfilova, said was sure the vote had been legitimate, the tass state news agency reported. although the vote may prove to be cleaner than in the past, critics said it was not fairer. under putin, the kremlin has neutered russia’s political debates, creating a pseudo-opposition and marginalizing actual opponents by jailing or blocking them from running, largely barring them from television, and harassing their campaigns. the parliament itself has become a rubber-stamping body, directed on how to act on most issues by the kremlin and offering no opposition on major decisions. before today the unauthorized opposition, the so-called “nonsystem opposition”, had only one lawmaker in the parliament, and its leaders and activists have been continuously harassed and occasionally physically attacked. this year, as part of the experiment to lend greater legitimacy to the elections, anti-putin parties were given greater leeway. that step, however, seemed to reflect the kremlin’s confidence in its position rather than any newfound political liberalism. with the country wrapped in nationalist sentiment following crimea’s annexation and intensified repression of dissent, there is virtually no desire for major political change. yabloko and parnas, the two leading parties running on anti-putin platforms, both failed to get above the 5%, with the early results suggesting that russia's parliament would now not have a single openly anti-putin lawmaker in parliament. with the final result never in doubt, there was a sensation of the system going through the motions and the majority of russians appeared to opt out of the vote, viewing it as of little relevance. many russians said they can’t remember a more lackluster election run. even the kremlin official tasked with managing the vote, vladimir volodin, has described united russia’s campaign as “sterile”, telling the business paper rbc that he believed the tactic was not to produce enthusiasm for the party but just to bring off a technically irreproachable campaign. the apathy was reflected in a record low turnout, at 40.37% the lowest since putin took power in 2000 and 20% lower than in the contested election in 2012. in moscow, the turnout was just 33%. in the days prior to voting, a startling number of russians were not even aware the elections were happening. the sharp drop in participation compared with 2011, suggested that russians' beliefs in what was politically possible in the country had narrowed considerably. at polling stations in moscow on sunday, many voters said they expected the vote to be cleaner than in previous years, though few expected it would be totally without fraud. many, even those voting for the ruling party, were ambivalent about whether the vote showed russia had democracy. asked whether he felt russia was democratic, one man pulled face and made a half-and-half gesture with his hand. “does russia have democracy?,” vyacheslav aleksandrovich, 63, said before voting. “maybe. probably we have some kind of democracy. i don’t know, i haven’t seen any other kind.” others were more definite, saying that although they did not believe they had full-fledged democracy, it was important to vote to keep what elements of it still exist in russia. “at the very least, it opposes the trend of authoritarianism that has appeared in russia recently,” lev karakhan, a television producer accompanied by his children said after voting.      putin's party wins big majority in russian parliamentary elections

"i think there's going to be a lot of focus [on the debates] and they've always been a really important part of the process," said peter eyre, a senior adviser with the commission on presidential debates, the independent organization that sponsors the events. watch the third presidential debate on abc news and abcnews.com at 9 p.m. et on wednesday, oct. 19. here's a rundown of the debates so far and what we know about the second and third head-to-head match-ups between donald trump and hillary clinton.  first presidential debate: sept. 26 at hofstra university in hempstead, new york. moderator: nbc's "nightly news" anchor lester holt the debate had six segments covering different subjects, as mandated by the commission. the commission had announced that holt selected three topics -- america's direction, achieving prosperity and securing america -- to cover during the debate, but noted that they were subject to change based on news events. vice presidential debate: oct. 4 at longwood university in farmville, virginia. moderator: cbs news correspondent elaine quijano the debate was set to feature nine segments, each about 10 minutes long. the topics of the debate were not announced in advance. tim kaine answered the first question, as a result of a coin toss. second presidential debate: oct. 9 at washington university in st. louis, missouri. moderators: abc news' chief global affairs correspondent martha raddatz and cnn anchor anderson cooper the debate was held in a town hall format, with about half the questions asked by members of the audience and the other by the moderators. gallup was responsible for finding the audience members, who are supposed to be uncommitted voters, the commission announced. the topics of the debate were not announced in advance. third presidential debate: oct. 19 at the university of nevada at las vegas. moderator: "fox news sunday" anchor chris wallace the final debate will be in the same format as the first one. the specific topics of the debate were announced today and include debt and entitlements, immigration, the economy, the supreme court, foreign hot spots and fitness to be president. they are subject to change based on news events.    much like the first presidential debate, clinton and trump are the only two candidates who will be on stage this sunday. based on the cpd's average of polls from five different national polls, clinton has 44.8 percent of the national vote, trump has 40.8 percent, and neither libertarian candidate gary johnson nor green party candidate jill stein passed the required 15 percent threshold to be included in the debate. the averages put johnson at 7.8 percent and green at 2.6 percent, respectively. the commission previously announced it will use five surveys -- abc news/washington post, cbs/new york times, cnn/opinion research corp., fox news and nbc/wall street journal -- to make the decision. kaine and pence were the only two candidates who participated in the vice presidential debate.  the names of any high-profile campaign guests have not yet been announced for the town hall debate. for that town hall debate, the participating audience will be anywhere in size from a couple dozen people up to as many as 100 people, with a viewing audience of about 1,000. polling company gallup has been tasked with finding the audience members for the participating audience, who are expected to be uncommitted voters. in the run-up to the first presidential debate, attention was paid to some of the big names who would be in the audience off-stage. chelsea clinton attended the debate, a first for her this election cycle after not attending any of the democratic primary debates. and then another familiar face was present in the front row supporting team clinton: mark cuban. the billionaire dallas mavericks owner is a vocal clinton supporter and reportedly went so far as to volunteer to play trump in clinton's mock debates. he has said the clinton team never returned his email offer, but they did keep him in mind for another move.  just got a front row seat to watch @hillaryclinton overwhelm @realdonaldtrump at the "humbling at hofstra" on monday. it is on !  about 1,000 people are expected in the viewing audience at each debate, and while eyre didn’t expect there to be frequent cuts to the audience by tv cameras, there is a chance that special guests sitting near the front may be seen on tv at some point. the audience will be a mix of guests of the universities, guests of the campaigns and "others who have made the debates possible, including sponsors, members of the media, security, etc.," he said.  commission officials are tasked with picking the moderators for the debates, and while they normally announce their decisions in august, the final list was released in september this year. "these journalists bring extensive experience to the job of moderating, and understand the importance of using expanded time periods effectively,” frank j. fahrenkopf jr. and michael d. mccurry, co-chairs of the nonpartisan commission, said in the statement announcing the moderators. raddatz, who is a co-anchor of the abc news sunday show "this week," is the only one of the four who has been selected by the commission before. she moderated the vice presidential debate between joe biden and rep. paul ryan in 2012. cnn's candy crowley was selected to moderate the town hall-style debate between president obama and mitt romney in 2012. this year, that format will have two moderators: raddatz and cooper. crowley was the second female debate moderator ever. the first was abc news' carole simpson in 1992. "the formats chosen for this year's debates are designed to build on the formats introduced in 2012, which focused big blocks of time on major domestic and foreign topics,” fahrenkopf and mccurry said in the statement. “we are grateful for their willingness to moderate, and confident that the public will learn more about the candidates and the issues as a result.”  trump spoke repeatedly about his relaxed approach to preparations ahead of the first presidential debate. that might have changed with the second debate, but not according to trump: he denies that a town hall-style event in new hampshire on thursday -- complete with a timer set to the same response times required for sunday's debate -- was practice for the main event this weekend. kaine and pence have both been running mock debates, with d.c. power lawyer bob barnett acting as pence and wisconsin gov. scott walker standing in as kaine. as for the top of their tickets, the candidates took dramatically different approaches to debate prep in keeping with their starkly different campaigns. clinton cleared her schedule and took herself off the campaign trail for the four days before the first debate. she did intensive debate prep, which included mock debates complete with a trump stand-in: her longtime aide philippe reines, whom clinton has called "loyal, passionate and shrewd." she also reviewed trump's performance in republican primary debates, according to campaign sources. by contrast, trump had two campaign events scheduled days before the first debate on sept. 26. his debate prep was slim and he did not delve into policy or participated in mock debates, sources have told abc news. the one study tactic that they both shared was a review of their opponent's past performances. but while aides say clinton actively reviewed trump's work, senior level trump sources said he was given an ipad loaded with footage of old clinton debates, though it's unclear how much time he spent watching them. trump was reportedly being advised by his senior campaign staff, including campaign manager kellyanne conway and campaign ceo stephen bannon, as well as former fox news chief roger ailes, who has worked on the campaigns of presidents george w. bush and ronald reagan in the past. well-known washington lawyer bob barnett was said to be advising clinton during her debate prep. he helped her prepare for the primary debates by playing sen. bernie sanders. the campaign reportedly found someone to play trump in their mock debates but they were tight-lipped about the person's identity. trump didn’t speak extensively about his debate prep, but talked about the tone he expected to take. "i'm going to be very respectful of her," trump said during a phone interview on fox news before the first debate, referring to clinton. "i think she deserves that and i'm going to be nice. and if she's respectful of me, that’ll be nice. we'll have something that i think people will respect as a debate but we'll see where it all goes. you really never know exactly how it's going to turn out and that's why we’re going to have a lot of people watching," trump said. abc news' liz kreutz, john santucci, candace smith and ryan struyk contributed to this report. watch full live coverage of the third presidential debate at 9 p.m. et on wednesday, oct. 19. coverage and analysis of the debate will begin on abcnews.com/live at 7 p.m. et.      everything you need to know about the presidential debates      
__label__0 the suspect in a spate of bombings that terrorized the new york city metropolitan area this weekend visited a city in pakistan known for being a hotbed of insurgent activity, a source told abc news. the suspect, ahmad khan rahami, was born in 1988 in afghanistan and is a naturalized u.s. citizen, according to the fbi. rahami spent time in quetta, pakistan, and afghanistan during a trip, from april 2013 to march 2014, the source said.     quetta, a city of about 2 million people, is a known hotspot for insurgents and the reported home of the leadership of the afghan taliban. "if they spent more than a few days, it raises suspicions that while they were there, they will have been recruited by terrorist groups," national security consultant richard clarke said on abc news' "world news tonight" monday, referring to rahami's travel to the area. a spokesman for the taliban, zabiullah mujahid, told abc news that there was no link between the taliban and rahami.   afghan and u.s. government officials say they believe quetta has sheltered the afghan taliban's leaders since the u.s. invasion forced them to flee the country in 2002. the taliban's central leadership council, believed to be based there, is known as the quetta shura. officials say leaders there have planned and directed attacks across the border in afghanistan and coordinated with terrorist groups like al-qaeda. the area has a major border crossing that leads to kandahar in afghanistan and is reported to be a transit point for extremists traveling in and out of afghanistan and a hub for illegal trade crossing the porous and largely unsecured border.   several al-qaeda militants have been killed or captured in the area, and the united states last year destroyed an al-qaeda base across the border in kandahar province that u.s. officials said was the largest militant training camp discovered in the history of the afghanistan war. quetta harbors a long-simmering insurgency against the pakistani government. the city has seen a number of significant violent attacks and bombings, most recently last month, when a blast killed more than 70 people and injured over 100 others. in may of this year, a u.s. airstrike in baluchistan province, which encompasses quetta, killed taliban leader mullah akhtar muhammad mansour. the pentagon said in a 2014 report that as long as afghan taliban forces enjoy “sanctuary” in quetta and in neighboring border areas of western pakistan, the afghan insurgency will persist. rahami, who was captured monday after a shootout with police, is being held on charges of attempted murder of a law enforcement officer, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.      ny-nj bombing suspect visited taliban stronghold in pakistan      
__label__0 donald trump jr., a son of the republican presidential nominee, took to twitter on monday to publish a graphic that likened syrian refugees to skittles. the graphic asked the question, “if i had a bowl of skittles and i told you just three would kill you. would you take a handful?”  this image says it all. let's end the politically correct agenda that doesn't put america first. #trump2016 pic.twitter.com/9fhwog7ssn “that’s our syrian refugee problem,” it reads. trump added, “this image says it all.”   the tweet drew both sharp criticism and support in the form of responses, retweets and online comments. the uproar led mars inc., the parent company of the manufacturer of skittles, to issue a statement. mars tweeted, “skittles are candy; refugees are people.”  pic.twitter.com/vuwykzqujc hillary clinton’s traveling spokesman, nick merrill, retweeted trump, saying, “this is disgusting.”  this is disgusting. https://t.co/qygl03cnc1 the white house announced last week that it wants to increase to 110,000 the number of refugees the u.s. accepts in the next fiscal year. this year, the country has taken in more than 11,000 syrian refugees. more than 11 million people — over half of syria’s population — have fled their homes, according to the latest u.n. figures, with 6.6 million displaced in syria and 4.8 million seeking refuge abroad. donald trump sr. has proposed what he called “extreme vetting” of immigrants entering the country, suggesting ideological tests and screening based on religious background.      donald trump jr. compares syrian refugees to skittles      
__label__0 evan bayh was the democrats' prize senate recruit this election cycle, a popular former senator and governor with a huge war chest and sky-high name id in his home state. top democrats heralded his surprise entrance into the race in july with hopes that republicans would abandon his little-known and underfunded gop rival, rep. todd young, and give up on indiana. instead, outside gop groups including the chamber of commerce and the billionaire koch brothers have poured some $10 million into the race, eroding bayh's fund-raising advantage and closing his lead over young to low- or mid-single digits. with republicans determined to retain their narrow majority in the senate, they have brought big-name surrogates like former president george w. bush and house speaker paul ryan into the state. they have succeeded in putting bayh on the defensive, in the process turning the race into one of the hardest fought contests in this year's heated struggle for control of the u.s. senate and the balance of power in washington, d.c. "i'm not a lobbyist," bayh was forced to insist in an ad responding to a barrage of attacks on his work in washington, d.c., since leaving the senate six years ago. and with bayh dropping fast in the polls, outside democratic groups are belatedly coming to his aid, with the senate majority pac and the democratic senatorial campaign committee both announcing spending on his behalf in recent days, a move some democrats once hoped would not be necessary. "clearly our message is resonating with hoosiers — and over a very short time period," young said at a recent news conference before former president bush headlined an indianapolis fundraiser on his behalf. "this race for united state senate here in indiana could dictate control of the u.s. senate and even composition of the supreme court moving forward," young added. "it is essential that republicans hold on to this seat in what is otherwise a republican state." democrats concede that their initial strategy of scaring off the gop with a shock-and-awe entry from bayh didn't pan out. but they insist they still have a path to victory, even if some privately question whether the 60-year-old bayh is up for a tougher fight than he envisioned when sen. chuck schumer of new york urged him into the race. bayh himself, appearing over the weekend at a jefferson jackson day dinner banquet in muncie, dismissed the attacks coming his way. "these are the acts of desperate people who don't stand for a doggone thing," bayh said. "they know the only way they can try and win this election is not on the basis of their ideas or what they're going to do for you or the good people of delaware county because they've got no ideas for the people of delaware county." the race in indiana is practically the only competitive senate contest being fought this year in a red state, where donald trump is all but certain to triumph easily over democrat hillary clinton, who herself played a role in encouraging bayh to run. both sides agree that indiana's gop tilt helps young, although democrats contend that bayh's strong reputation and high name id counteract it. young remains little known, but republicans have succeeded in driving down bayh's numbers with ads tying him to clinton and criticizing his support for president barack obama's health care law, which is unpopular in the state. incumbent gop sen. dan coats is retiring. democrats insist they can still win in indiana, but the changing landscape here comes amid a shifting senate map nationally that's looking more favorable for the gop. republicans now have a 54-46 advantage in the senate, meaning democrats need to pick up five seats to win control, or four if clinton wins the white house since the vice president casts tie-breaking votes. democrats appear to be losing confidence in battleground ohio and florida but pushing into north carolina and missouri, while new hampshire and pennsylvania remain closely fought. republicans have all but abandoned gop incumbents in illinois and wisconsin, but are focused on picking up a seat in nevada, where minority leader harry reid is retiring. in the latest development in indiana, the national rifle association announced it is coming into the state with a $500,000 buy to attack bayh's "anti-gun record." despite the influx of outside spending, indiana university public affairs professor paul helmke says the race is still bayh's to lose. "evan bayh came with a major lead in money, which meant there was going to be a lot of outside money coming in," said helmke, a former republican mayor of fort wayne, indiana, who ran for u.s. senate in 1998 but lost to bayh. "if they were thinking this was a laydown, then that was a mistake on their part. bayh's going to have to work this one really hard to win." ——— werner reported from washington.      republicans see turnaround in indiana senate race      
__label__0 with the world watching, president barack obama today took an apparent swipe at donald trump's plan to build a wall along the u.s.-mexico border, in his eighth and final address to the united nations general assembly as commander in chief. "today a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself," obama warned, without naming the republican presidential nominee. obama further cautioning against "the same forces of global integration" that have made democracies interdependent while exposing "deep fault lines in the existing international order" like gaps between the rich and poor created by capitalism throughout the world. he made two other references to the ineffectiveness of walls in stopping global forces, quipping in an apparent reference to the zika virus that "mosquitoes don't respect walls" and saying of terrorism that "the world is simply too small to be able to build a wall and stop it from affecting our own societies." though he never directly addressed the u.s. presidential election, obama's message for the general assembly was in many ways applicable to the impulses raging in the race, citing "a contest between authoritarianism and democracy right now" and an appeal for a top-down "strongman model." obama rejected such tendencies. "history shows that strongmen are then left with two paths," he said. "permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies abroad, which can lead to war."     speaking about the big picture, the obama recounted the progress made during his presidency, on issues such as the global financial crisis, international terrorism and re-establishing relations with cuba. "this is important work," he stressed. "it has made a real difference in the lives of our people, and it could not have happened had we not worked together." obama said nations "can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration" or "retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion." "i want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not backward," he said, although he added that doing so would require nations of the world to "acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction." "the answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration," obama said. "instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared and that the disruptions — economic, political and cultural — that are caused by integration are squarely addressed." obama demanded that democracies of the world "speak out forcefully" for "freedom and dignity." "a world in which 1 percent of the economy controls the other 99 percent will never be stable," he said. "these are the policies i've pursued in the united states, and with clear results" — touting progress in job creation, cutting poverty, improving infrastructure and investing in childhood education. his speech came as fighting in syria has resumed after the syrian military declared monday an end to the fragile cease-fire deal that was brokered between the u.s. and russia just over a week ago. "together now we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home. we should all welcome the pledges of increased assistance that have been made at this general assembly gathering," obama said. "there's a lot of nations right now that are doing the right thing, but many nations — particularly those blessed with wealth and the benefits of geography — that can do more to offer a hand." in the same month that north korea conducted its second nuclear test of the year, obama highlighted the benefits of free markets over markets resisting influence from globalization. "we cannot unwind integration any more than we can stuff technology back into a box, nor can we look to failed models of the past. if we start resorting to trade wars, market distorting subsidies, overreliance on national resources instead of innovation, these approaches will make us poor collectively, and they're more likely to lead to conflict," he said. "and the stark contrast between, say, the success of the republic of korea and the wasteland of north korea shows that central plan to control the economy is a dead end," obama said.      obama evokes donald trump's wall in final un general assembly speech as president      
__label__0 aid to syria has been suspended after yesterday's attack on a united nations and syrian arab red crescent convoy in the countryside of aleppo. the convoy was delivering wheat flour, health supplies and other emergency aid to some 75,000 people in urum al-kubra in rural aleppo, according to the u.n. of the 31 trucks in the convoy, at least 18 were hit. a syrian red crescent warehouse was also destroyed and a health clinic severely damaged, the u.n. said. about 20 civilians and one sarc staff member were killed as they were unloading the trucks, according to a joint statement from the syrian arab red crescent, the international committee of the red cross and the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies. "the convoys that we had hoped to move across the border to syria as well as aid inside syria have been temporarily put on hold. as a result, millions of people across syria run a very real risk of not receiving the assistance they need because of this callous attack," david swanson, a spokesman for the u.n. office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, told abc news. he noted that all parties to the conflict were notified about the convoy and that it was marked with aid signs. "obviously, we are absolutely outraged that such an attack can take place," he said. the u.n.'s aid coordinator said the attack on the aid convoy could amount to a war crime. "let me be clear: if this callous attack is found to be a deliberate targeting of humanitarians, it would amount to a war crime. i call for an immediate, impartial and independent investigation into this deadly incident," stephen o’brien, the u.n.'s undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, said in a statement after the attack. the red crescent in aleppo confirmed in a statement that omar barakat, sarc's director in urum al-kubra, was among those killed. yousef houran, a lawyer and activist in syria, said he witnessed aid trucks burning after the attack in urum al-kubra. "bodies of red crescent volunteers are still burning inside the cars and no one can get close to them because of repeated airstrikes on the same spot," he told abc news last night following the attack.  our thoughts go to families of brave @syredcrescent volunteers & staff killed in tonight's terrible attack on aid convoy in rural #aleppo  two u.n. trucks carrying flour and food supplies — enough to feed about 185,000 people for one month — have been parked by the syria-turkey border, waiting for security assurances in order to make the journey into the besieged eastern aleppo. these trucks will remain parked until the u.n. re-evaluates the situation on the ground. today, the four besieged towns of madaya, zabadani, foua and kefraya were supposed to receive humanitarian assistance, but the u.n. has also put these deliveries on hold indefinitely. after the syrian military declared the end of the u.s.-russian-brokered truce last night, airstrikes hit several areas in aleppo. "we heard from a partner from aleppo that there were 100 airstrikes in about five hours yesterday," misty buswell, save the children's regional advocacy director for the middle east, told abc news. "it's brutal what is going on right now and there has to be accountability for what happened last night. this is not the first time that we have seen aid being attacked in syria. this demonstrates the new lows that this conflict has reached. we’re hearing that hospitals are overwhelmed by the number of casualties that are coming in today." at least 38 civilians, including one child and three women, were killed by airstrikes in aleppo and its western and eastern countryside, according to the syrian observatory for human rights. today, airstrikes continued and the observatory said that warplanes dropped 27 barrel bombs on different neighborhoods in aleppo city. after an international syria support group meeting today, u.s. secretary of state john kerry told reporters that "the cease-fire is not dead." the u.n.'s special envoy for syria, staffan de mistura, echoed that statement but warned that the cease-fire is "in danger." the group is due to meet again on friday. the cease-fire pact focused on reducing violence in the war-torn country and delivering humanitarian aid. the agreement had to be reached before russia and the u.s. would work together to fight militant groups isis and al-nusra in syria. after yesterday's attack on the aid convoy, the u.s. department of state released a statement yesterday saying it would now reconsider the prospect of cooperating with russia. "the united states is outraged by reports that a humanitarian aid convoy was bombed near aleppo today," the statement read. "for more than a week, we have urged moscow to fulfill the commitments it made in geneva to facilitate the unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid to the syrian people. and for more than a week, the syrian regime repeatedly denied entry to these u.n. convoys, preventing them from delivering urgent food, water and medical supplies to desperate syrian citizens. only today did the regime finally grant permits for some convoys to proceed. the destination of this convoy was known to the syrian regime and the russian federation and yet these aid workers were killed in their attempt to provide relief to the syrian people. the united states will raise this issue directly with russia. given the egregious violation of the cessation of hostilities we will reassess the future prospects for cooperation with russia." russia and the syrian government denied that they were behind the attack on the aid convoy. the aleppo media center today posted photos on twitter of the destroyed aid trucks.  ????? ????????? ??????? ?? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? #??? ???????? ??? ????????? ?????? ????? ???? ?? ?????? ??????.#aleppoamc pic.twitter.com/ksjfe8gilc  nearly 13.5 million people in syria are in need of humanitarian assistance; an additional 4.8 million have fled their country, and 6.1 million are internally displaced, according to this month's figures from the u.n.'s office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs.      humanitarian assistance to syria suspended after attack on aid convoy

__label__0 a "journal" belonging to new york city bombing suspect ahmad rahami has been recovered by authorities, two federal officials told abc news. the writings were apparently on rahami when he allegedly engaged in a firefight with police, and the pages were shot through with a bullet. the officials said that in them, rahami refers to the late american al-qaeda cleric anwar al-awlaki, whose sermons and writings have been linked to a number of terrorist attacks and plots in the u.s.     a federal complaint filed against rahami late tuesday said that in the journal, he also praised nidal hasan, the 2009 fort hood shooter, and al-qaeda founder osama bin laden.

"[god willing] the sounds of the bombs will be heard in the streets. gun shots to your police. death to your oppression." investigators have also seized "a lot of papers" at a home linked to rahami, a source told abc news. as of late monday, authorities had not determined a motive for rahami, who has been linked to bombings over the weekend in the manhattan neighborhood of chelsea and in new jersey. though two of the explosives were housed in pressure cookers, as was the case in the 2013 boston marathon bombing, the officials said there was no mention in rahami's purported writings of the perpetrators of that attack, dzhokhar and tamerlan tsarnaev. today officials said they're also investigating a possible link to five unexploded pipe bombs recovered in elizabeth, n.j. rahami has been charged with attempted murder related to the shootout with police just before he was apprehended monday. michele mcphee is a boston-based freelance journalist and frequent abc news contributor.      bombing suspect's 'journal' recovered, officials say      
__label__0 concerns about new york and new jersey bombing suspect ahmad khan rahami's intentions were raised to authorities by his father and a neighbor more than once over the past years, abc news has learned. two years ago, rahami's father told the fbi that his son was interacting with "bad people" overseas and a concerned citizen in the neighborhood told authorities that rahami's associates may have been trying to procure explosives, sources told abc news. the fbi first became aware of rahami in the summer of 2014, when local law enforcement contacted the agency's new jersey field office about him, sources said. a dispute at the rahami home had brought local law enforcement to the house at that time. a neighbor told the authorities he overheard rahami's father calling his son a "terrorist," according to a u.s. official. in addition, the neighbor said rahami’s father had expressed concern his son may be in contact with people overseas who were collecting explosives, abc news was told. the fbi then opened a so-called "guardian" file on rahami, initiating a process to determine whether rahami had any links to terrorism or other criminal activity and whether a more formal investigation was warranted. the assessment of rahami produced no clear evidence or indications of radicalization, and at one point his father recanted his claims, sources said. rahami was not placed on any u.s. terrorism watch lists. speaking to reporters today outside of his new jersey home, rahami's father said he "called the fbi two years ago" about his son. "i told them you got a connection with this guy," he said, without offering any further information.   the fbi interviewed rahami’s father after new jersey officials compiled complaints and sent them a suspicious activity report. he told the fbi that his son had traveled to pakistan and was interacting with "bad people," according to sources. rahami's father also told the fbi his son had injured and beaten members of his immediate family -- but a grand jury declined to file charges against him. however, rahami's father later told the fbi he didn't mean to suggest his son was a terrorist, but that he was hanging out with "undesirables," the u.s. official said. at a press conference monday, the head of the fbi's field office in new york, bill sweeney, noted that the fbi had previously received "a report of a domestic incident," adding that "the allegations [were] recanted." however, sweeney did not address terrorism-related allegations. it’s unclear if the fbi or other law enforcement agencies interviewed rahami in 2014. as in most suspicious activity report cases they review, the fbi found no significant derogatory information in rahami's case, sources told abc news. in a statement today, the fbi acknowledged that in august 2014 they "initiated an assessment of ahmad rahami based upon comments made by his father after a domestic dispute that were subsequently reported to authorities." "the fbi conducted internal database reviews, interagency checks, and multiple interviews -- none of which revealed ties to terrorism," the statement said. one source emphasized that only a single report came to authorities related to rahami. had more reports come in, authorities would have looked further at him, the source said, adding that the fbi does not have the resources to put every subject of a suspicious activity report under full-time surveillance. "we should not be keeping people under surveillance indefinitely" when there is no solid reason, another u.s. official said, adding that doing so would violate constitutional rights. "our job together is to find those needles in a hay stack," fbi director james comey recently told lawmakers. "in fact, our job is harder than that, it's to find pieces of hay in that haystack that may become a needle and disrupt them before they move from consuming to acting on that [online] poisonous propaganda." the fbi’s ability to assess potential terrorists came under intense scrutiny after florida native omar mateen opened fire in orlando’s pulse nightclub in june, killing 49 people and injuring scores more. in may 2013 the fbi had obtained sufficient information to open a preliminary investigation into mateen — coworkers told authorities that mateen had made terrorism-related comments at work. but after ten months of investigation, including two interviews with mateen, the fbi determined there wasn’t enough information to indicate he was "possibly a terrorist," as fbi director james comey put it after the orlando attack. two months later, in july 2014, the fbi took another look at mateen because his name "surfaced" in a separate terrorism investigation, comey told reporters. mateen was interviewed again, but authorities found no reason to continue tracking him.      fbi opened previous inquiry into bombing suspect ahmad khan rahami      
__label__0 following the shooting death of an unarmed black man by a police officer in tulsa, oklahoma, last friday, democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton spoke out today against police violence. “this horrible shooting again. how many times do we have to see this in our country? in tulsa, an unarmed man with his hands in the air,” clinton said, calling into "the steve harvey morning show." forty-year-old terence crutcher was fatally shot by a white police officer after his suv stalled on the road. video of the incident released after the shooting appears to show crutcher with his hands raised in the air.     calling the act “unbearable” and saying officer-involved shootings “need to be intolerable,” clinton appealed to a white audience to address unconscious discrimination. "maybe i can, by speaking directly to white people, say look, this is not who we are. we have got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias," she said.  another unarmed black man was shot in a police incident. this should be intolerable. we have so much work to do. #terencecrutcher -h  clinton’s policy proposal for criminal justice reform includes developing national standards on police officers’ use of force, supporting legislation to end racial profiling, and committing $1 billion in funding to training programs and research to “tackle” implicit bias. abc news’ julia jacobo and josh haskell contributed to this report.      hillary clinton calls tulsa police shooting 'horrible,' reiterates call for improved policing      
__label__0 with seven weeks until election day, hillary clinton and her allies are set to outspend donald trump and his allies by wide margins during the homestretch. a whopping 95 percent of all campaign television ad spending scheduled between today and election day — more than $143 million worth — comes from clinton’s team, according to an abc news analysis of cmag/kantar media data. team clinton will spend $143.2 million on television ads, versus only $6.8 million for team trump. the difference in future spending in key battleground states is even starker — with team clinton slated to spend 53 times as much as team trump on television ads in florida between now and nov. 8. in florida, clinton is spending $36.6 million, versus just under $700,000 for trump. the differences continue in ohio ($20.9 million versus $1.8 million), pennsylvania ($18.8 million versus $1.5 million) and north carolina ($14.3 million versus $1.3 million.) those are crucial states for trump’s campaign. if he wins all four, he will almost certainly land in the white house. if he loses even one, it will be very difficult for clinton to lose the general election. recent polling in these states has shown a tight matchup but a lead for clinton in pennsylvania. while ads for the campaigns are guaranteed to be at lower prices during these final 60 days, outside groups can get charged steep prices. that’s why it’s important that priorities usa action has already scheduled so many ads: it will be paying less than trump’s outside groups — like the nra and his super pacs — will be paying if they try to schedule ads now. clinton’s campaign is footing the bill for slightly more than half her scheduled television advertising, while trump’s campaign is slated for about $4 in $10. clinton’s behemoth super pac accounts for virtually all the rest of pro-clinton spending, and trump’s spending is splintered among the nra and two other super pacs. team clinton has already spent $174 million on television ads during the general election, versus a mere $40 million for trump and his allies. the contrast is also stark when comparing only the campaigns: $110.7 million for clinton versus $18.7 million for trump. team clinton future ads florida: $36.6 million ohio: $20.9 million pennsylvania: $18.8 million north carolina: $14.3 million nevada: $10.1 million new hampshire: $7.3 million iowa: $7.1 million colorado: $5.8 million virginia: $0.5 million nebraska: $0.2 million national: $21.6 million total: $143.2 million team trump future ads ohio: $1.8 million pennsylvania: $1.5 million north carolina: $1.3 million florida: $0.7 million colorado: $0.3 million iowa: $0.2 million new hampshire: $0.1 million maine: $0.1 million national: $0.6 million total: $6.8 million      hillary clinton slated to spend 53 times as much as donald trump on florida tv ads      
__label__0 the clinton campaign has slammed donald trump as “a fraud who believes the rules don’t apply to him” over reports that the gop presidential candidate used money from his charitable foundation to settle two lawsuits filed against his for-profit businesses. the washington post reported today that trump made two payments totaling $258,000 to settle suits — one involving the mar-a-lago club, which he owns, in florida and another involving one of his golf clubs in new york.  clinton’s deputy communications director, christina reynolds, put out a statement after the washington post story was published, calling trump a fraud. “clearly the trump foundation is as much a charitable organization as trump university is an institute of higher education,” she said. “trump’s version of charity is taking money from others to settle his own legal issues ... which experts say is a clear violation of laws governing charitable organizations,” reynolds said.   abc news has reached out to the trump campaign for comment.     lloyd mayer, a professor at the university of notre dame law school, told abc news that if the allegations made by the post are true, the payments violate federal law.   “federal tax law bars a private foundation like the trump foundation from using its assets to benefit its insiders or the businesses they own. that’s exactly what’s been alleged here. if true, the foundation and its managers, including mr. trump, violated tax laws,” mayer told abc news.  the lawsuit involving mar-a-lago, filed in 2007, revolved around a complaint by the town of palm beach over an oversize flagpole at the club. publicly available court documents show that as a condition of a settlement, “mr. trump will contribute $100,000 to charities agreed to between the parties” in return for the town’s waiving fines against mar-a-lago. another section of the court documents specified, “mar-a-lago shall contribute $100,000 to charities agreed to between parties dealing with iraq war veterans, american flag or the local va hospital.”   in a september 2007 letter to the town, as reported by the post, trump wrote, “i have sent a check for $100,000 to fisher house. although the court documents show that under the settlement, trump or mar-a-lago would make the payment, the payment apparently instead came from the trump foundation. tax forms for the trump foundation show that in 2007 the charity gave $100,000 to fisher house, an organization that helps pay for housing for veterans’ relatives when their loved ones are receiving medical treatment. it was one of only three $100,000 donations it made that year; the other two were to a new york hospital and a police athletic league. fisher house confirmed to abc news that it received a $100,000 check from the foundation on sept. 11, 2007. it does not have a copy of the check available.  the irs has strict rules on the operation of tax-exempt private foundations, including against what it calls self-dealing. to qualify for tax-exempt status, a foundation is required to demonstrate, among other things, that “no part of its net earnings inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual,” according to an online irs publication. mayer noted that if the lawsuit settlement was paid for by trump’s foundation, he wouldn’t be the first person to violate tax law in this way. “it’s not unheard of for people to use their private foundations for their own benefit. usually if the irs learns about it, the insider has to pay a penalty tax and repay foundation with interest,” mayer said. it can be a civil action or a criminal violation, but mayer has “never heard of anyone serving prison time for this kind of thing.” “here the foundation allegedly paid for a substantial benefit to trump’s business — the dropping of lawsuits. that is clearly crossing the line. it’s not even close,” he said.  the trump foundation takes in substantial donations from people and organizations, including until eight years ago trump himself. in 2007, tax forms show that the charity had revenue of close to $4.1 million, from contributions, gifts and grants. of that total, trump donated $35,000. similarly, in 2008, trump gave $30,000 to the foundation. in previous years, his contributions were bigger, ranging from $184,000 to $713,000. trump made no donations to his foundation from 2009 to 2014, which is the last year for which records are available. a few years after the mar-a-lago settlement, the foundation reportedly paid $158,000 to settle a lawsuit against one of trump’s golf courses in new york, which led to a charitable donation by the foundation. the foundation is under investigation by the new york attorney general’s office over a payment made to a political group associated with florida attorney general pam bondi, a trump supporter who spoke at the republican national convention this summer. a person familiar with the probe tells abc news that the new york attorney general’s office is also investigating all the donations mentioned in the post report. the clinton campaign’s reynolds said in her statement, “once again, trump has proven himself a fraud who believes the rules don’t apply to him. it’s past time for him to release his tax returns to show whether his tax issues extend to his own personal finances.” abc news’ liz kreutz contributed to this report.      clinton camp slams trump over allegations his charity paid his business settlements

__label__0 a photographer who says he took the skittles photo used by donald trump jr. in a tweet on the "syrian refugee problem," tells abc news that he is himself a refugee. "i’m really really appalled by having my image, you know, on twitter used against the refugees," said david kittos, 48. trump jr., the eldest son of republican presidential nominee donald trump, posted a graphic on twitter featuring an image of a bowl of skittles, with a caption equating syrian refugees to poisoned candy, which sparked outrage among many on social media. “if i had a bowl of skittles and i told you just three would kill you. would you take a handful?” the tweet's graphic says, "that's our syrian refugee problem." david kittos, 48, who told abc news he took the photo and who has what appears to be an identical image posted on flickr from 2010, said, "how someone could twist things, and i don’t know, use my image to compare some sort of poor refugee to a poison sort of skittle, that is just really beyond belief."     kittos, who said he lives in the united kingdom and left cyprus as a refugee when he was 6, claims that he was not asked permission for use of his photo. "i haven’t put the image for sale, and it was all rights reserved, so no, i wasn’t really expecting anyone to want to take it," kittos said. "i have had stuff stolen before but when i got an email from some news website i was sort of really annoyed and disgusted to be honest." kittos told abc news he does photography as a hobby and took the skittles photo while experimenting with different flash techniques in his living room six years ago, never expecting it to become part of a political campaign. the plight of refugees is an issue close to kittos, who recalls fleeing cyprus as a child. "we all had to kind of just take our stuff and run away. it was quite frightening for all people who had to do it, especially for the people who actually lost family and not just their belongings," he said. if he could talk to donald trump, kittos said he would ask him to apologize to syrian refugees. "but i don’t expect he will do that," he said. the trump campaign responded to a question about the photo with a more general comment on the controversy over the tweet. "america has become less safe under hillary clinton and barack obama, and clinton's planned 550 percent increase in syrian refugees is a dangerous proposal that will put american lives at risk," the campaign's senior communications adviser, jason miller, said in a statement. "speaking the truth might upset those who would rather be politically correct than safe, but the american people want a change, and only donald trump will do what's needed to protect us," the statement said.      refugee says he took skittles photo donald trump jr. used in anti-refugee tweet      
__label__0 neal west stood outside bernie sanders’ event at kent state university on saturday and asked people leaving to consider voting for the green party’s candidate, jill stein, though he knew full well that inside, the senator had repeated his call for his fans to vote for clinton. west said that he voted for sanders in the primary and that, in his opinion, stein was closer to sanders than clinton on the issues. as he passed out flyers, he rejected the key argument from sanders that in a battleground state like ohio, where polls have the two major candidates neck and neck, he should vote for clinton to stave off a trump win. “if the democratic party had chosen a candidate that everybody would support, then there wouldn’t be an issue at all with trump winning,” he said. asked specifically if he worried about trump winning, west went on: “that has nothing to do with me.” it remains to be seen whether bernie sanders, the choice candidate on many college campuses during the primary season, will be an effective surrogate for hillary clinton, who urgently needs the student and millennial vote. while stumping for clinton at two universities in ohio over the weekend, sanders spent minimal time making a case for clinton, but instead focused his remarks on why voters should reject her opponent. sanders spoke passionately against donald trump. he accused the republican party nominee of rejecting science and trying to delegitimize barack obama’s presidency. “you want to disagree with obama? disagree with obama. but do not go around putting a lot of money into trying to tell the american people that because we have an african american who happens to be president today that he is not a legitimate president,” the senator said while speaking at akron university. “that is an awful and divisive and terrible thing to do.” but when talking about his former primary opponent, the vermont senator primarily compared clinton to trump or listed ways in which she agrees with his own signature policy proposals on college affordability and health care. “hillary clinton and i believe that the time is now to ask the wealthiest people and the largest corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes,” he said during his swing through the battleground state. however, recent polling suggests that when it comes to winning the youth vote (a key demographic for president obama) perhaps clinton’s greatest challenge is not trump, but other third-party candidates. in the most recent abc news/washington post poll, only 40 percent of adults under 30 years old backed clinton in the general election -- a stark contrast from the 60 percent that obama won in 2012. this is largely because one in three adults under 30 say they plan to vote for gary johnson or jill stein -- or not vote at all. but enthusiasm also matters: even months after the democratic primary process wrapped up, 60 percent of democratic adults under 30 say they wish that bernie sanders had won the nomination. in fact, only a quarter of them say they wanted clinton to win the nod. during a listening tour across the state of ohio, abc news found that college students were much quicker to bring up the third-party options.     before hitting the campaign trail again, sanders specifically urged his supporters not to back third-party candidates. “now is not the time to be supporting a protest vote,” he said during an interview on msnbc. “right now we have to make sure trump does not become president and clinton is the person to beat him.” during a campaign stop at temple university on tuesday, clinton appealed to students who may still have reservations about her. “even if you are totally opposed to donald trump you may still have some questions about me. i get that,” she said. “and i want to do my best to answer those questions.” while speaking on campuses, both clinton and sanders emphasized getting to the polls. sanders told students they should not just vote, but volunteer and get involved with politics. “if we have a large voter turnout, for secretary clinton and ted strickland [the democratic nominee for senate in ohio] here in ohio and the entire nation will be very gratified for what you do," sanders said.      can bernie sanders help deliver the youth vote for hillary clinton?

"the campaign will continue to honor its contract with mr. lewandowski, which stipulates he will be paid through the end of the year. these payments are in no way compensation for services rendered.” abc news had previously reported the rapprochement between the fired employee and the presidential candidate. each day, trump wakes up, usually in his fifth avenue penthouse, and has a routine round of phone calls, sources told abc news last month. the calls include his campaign leadership, his children, some close allies and, quite frequently, lewandowski. “they talk almost every day,” one senior level campaign staffer said, requesting anonymity.       trump still paying fmr. campaign manager lewandowski as consultant      
__label__1 if republicans and donald trump really care about our military veterans, they will tell this douchebag to shut the hell up. ohio gop rep. warren davidson has outraged the veterans of foreign wars and the house veterans affairs committee by referring to veterans as “moochers” who are just pretending to be hurt or sick when they show up to get medical care from the va. “just like workers comp out here’s got moochers, i wish that there were no vets that were the same sort of problem on our society,” davidson said during a town hall event on monday. “but part of the problem is there are some vets that are moochers and they’re clogging up the system, and we do as taxpayers want to make sure the va filters out these folks that are pretenders. just like we wish there were no people out there with stolen valor, but that’s a problem in the vet community, too.” davidson, who won a special election to replace john boehner and is a supporter of donald trump, has drawn a shitstorm of criticism ever since. veterans of foreign wars spokesman joe davis slammed davidson for insulting the men and women who have served this country. “honorably discharged veterans with service-connected wounds, illnesses and injuries, or who are indigent due to circumstances beyond their control, are not moochers,” he said in a statement. house veterans affairs committee chairman jeff miller said he hopes that davidson merely “misspoke” and called upon him to clarify his remarks. and davidson’s remarks are particularly outrageous because davidson is a veteran himself. but when given the chance to back down, davidson did the opposite. “any effort to suggest i have anything other than a soldier’s passion for providing our veterans with the care they deserve is dishonest,” he said before his spokesman presented four case of va fraud to somehow prove his claims that veterans are “moochers.” the problem is that these cases involve people who pretend to be veterans. in other words, the people in these cases are not veterans. but davidson called veterans “moochers” anyway. it would have been so simple for davidson to just clarify his remarks, but he didn’t because, like donald trump, republicans are incapable of admitting when they are wrong. so davidson’s insult of veterans stands in the record as a testament to how republicans really feel about the men and women who fought for our country.       trump-supporting gop rep calls veterans ‘moochers’ during town hall event in ohio

__label__1 eric trump tried to spin a tale on fox news about how his father started with nothing to build a business empire, only to be smacked down with a reminder that donald trump started out as a millionaire. the republican nominee’s demon spawn appeared on on friday and attempted to portray his dad as just a normal guy who started with nothing in his journey to live the american dream. after trashing hillary clinton as not being relatable to millennial voters, eric trump was asked to explain how his father is relatable to them. and his answer was an effort to rewrite the reality of his dad’s life. “he’s built an amazing company. he’s become the epitome of the american dream.” eric trump said. “he’s gone from practically nothing to a man who’s just…” but that was a total lie and julie roginsky didn’t let the younger trump get away with it. roginsky cut eric trump off and reminded him that his father got $1 million from his father fred trump to start out with. nothing?” roginsky said. “he got a million bucks. come on, eric.” indeed, donald trump grew up the son of one of the richest men in america. he has never known poverty in his entire life. in 1978, he was given $1 million by his father, an amount that trump called a “small loan” moments after he claimed that life “hasn’t been easy for me” during a town hall event in october 2015. of course, that’s an insult to the millions of americans who live in poverty daily and can’t even get a real small loan to lift themselves out of it. they struggle to put food on the table and to pay the bills, but donald trump had everything he could ever want and all the opportunities money could buy. trump’s dad also started a million dollar trust fund for him and left him a multi-million dollar inheritance when he died. in other words, donald trump knows absolutely nothing about starting from nothing. but eric trump didn’t address roginsky’s reminder and just continued trying to sell his dad as a man who pulled himself up by his bootstraps. “he epitomized what america’s all about: opportunity and working hard and being able to achieve your dreams and what you want to succeed, right?” eric trump continued. “it’s no different than a zuckerberg, right, who went out with a great idea like a facebook and developed this idea and built it and grew it and grew it and grew it. that is achieving something, right? and i think it’s very different than a person who has been a career politician.” here’s the video via vidme.  can no member of trump’s family actually refrain from lying about their past? because it’s clear that donald trump and his children do not understand what it is like to grow up poor. they have had everything given to them on a golden platter and they’ve never had to work a real job a day in their lives. but for some reason, they think $1 million is the definition of starting with nothing.       watch: eric trump gets called out on fox news for claiming his dad started with nothing      
__label__1 early voting has begun in the battleground state of north carolina, and after months of contentious litigation, it’s clear why republicans wanted to squash it: returns are showing democrats with an eight point advantage over republicans. data analysis from targetsmart (who partnered with nbc news) shows that of the 4,000 plus presidential ballots that have been cast, 42 percent come from registered democrats, 34 percent from republicans, 25 percent from unaffiliated, and 1 percent from libertarians. contrast that to 2012, when mitt romney won north carolina by two percent: in early voting that year in that state, republicans held a five percent lead. now democrats hold an eight percent lead. in 2008, when president obama won (by a slim margin of 0.33 percent), democrats had an 11 point advantage. in 2004, democrats had an 11 point advantage, but kerry lost to bush by 13 percent. so while it’s not set in stone that whoever accumulates the most early votes wins, the last two elections (in which early voting has increased tremendously) shows that is the case. nate silver’s fivethirtyeight currently gives clinton a 43 percent chance of winning north carolina (and a 62 percent chance of winning the election overall). clinton’s chances have gone up almost five percent in the last week, with one reason being a strong showing for democrats in early voting. election model gives clinton a 48 percent chance of winning north carolina. again, no wonder governor pat mccory, who is currently losing his re-election bid, and the gop legislature wanted to do away with it. when democrats get a head start, that usually means good news in november. democrats shouldn’t get too comfortable. although early voting points to a democratic-leaning result, republicans could very well (and chances are great) benefit from in person voting on november 8. president obama never overcame romney in the polls in the weeks leading up to the election, almost all the polls for the month of september favored obama. with 45 days left until the election, anything can happen, so democrats need to continue to mobilize, register, and get out the vote for not just early ballots, but for november 8. rachel maddow broke down the facts on her show:        early voting in north carolina shows great news for democrats      
__label__1 it’s no secret that russia is very pro-donald trump, and donald trump is extremely pro-russia. his policies align with russia’s christmas list, and he hired – for a campaign manager – a man who benefited heavily from pro-russian monies during the ukrainian conflict. in fact, the ties between paul manafort and russian oligarchs became so widely known that it caused his premature departure from the campaign, prompting many questions to be raised. the trump campaign thought this would all be behind them in no time. but, as usual, they were wrong. on friday, it was a announced that u.s. intelligence officials are investigating carter page, a foreign policy adviser to trump, for alleged ties to russia. intelligence officials have reason to believe that page has opened up secret and backroom communications with top russian officials in an ongoing effort to have economic sanctions lifted. according to yahoo news, which first broke the story: the activities of trump adviser carter page, who has extensive business interests in russia, have been discussed with senior members of congress during recent briefings about suspected efforts by moscow to influence the presidential election, the sources said. after one of those briefings, senate minority leader harry reid wrote fbi director james comey, citing reports of meetings between a trump adviser (a reference to page) and “high ranking sanctioned individuals” in moscow over the summer as evidence of “significant and disturbing ties” between the trump campaign and the kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau. the reports apparently had some members of congress “taken aback,” due to the overwhelming and disturbing evidence that shows these ties. congressional members, which includes california democrat dianne feinstein, fear that such ties could lead to an unfair tampering with not only u.s.-russian relations, but undercut foreign policy and even the november presidential election. page is a former banker who worked for merrill lynch and is based in moscow, giving him strong ties with rich and influential russian officials. in fact, one of page’s business buddies is especially problematic for american diplomacy and international law: but u.s. officials have since received intelligence reports that during that same three-day trip, page met with igor sechin, a longtime putin associate and former russian deputy prime minister who is now the executive chairman of rosneft, russian’s leading oil company, a well-placed western intelligence source tells yahoo news. that meeting, if confirmed, is viewed as especially problematic by u.s. officials because the treasury department in august 2014 named sechin to a list of russian officials and businessmen sanctioned over russia’s “illegitimate and unlawful actions in the ukraine. so now that that the trump campaign is once again under the microscope for shady russian ties, they did what they know best: they lied. page has been listed as a foreign policy adviser to trump since march. in august, hope hicks, spokeswoman for the campaign, confirmed that carter was an adviser. now? communications director jason miller told the hill that page is “not an adviser and has made no contribution to the campaign.” so which is it? the campaign and its spokeswoman have confirmed that page is in fact an adviser, and now their communications director says he’s not nor has he ever been. it’s becoming clearer and clearer everyday that the trump campaign is nothing more than a puppet of the kremlin and putin’s rich, thuggish buddies. but no, let’s continue to talk about hillary clinton’s pneumonia, because that’s way more important than a potentially stolen election by the same people supporting one of the candidates.       another trump adviser under investigation for russian ties      
__label__1 the epidemic of black men being killed at the hands of police officers in america has not gone unnoticed on the international stage. according to a according to a report by a united nations working group, which will be debated at the u.n. human rights council on monday, this situation constitutes a full-blown “human rights crisis” that is reminiscent of the days of lynchings. “contemporary police killings and the trauma that they create are reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching,” said the report by the u.n. working group of experts on people of african descent. the u.n. report draws a stark comparison between modern day fatal shootings at the hands of law enforcement and the lynchings of blacks that swept the nation in the 19th and 20th centuries. the report comes as racial tensions in america have boiled over yet again in the wake of more deadly shootings that have rocked the country. historically, the majority of african americans killed in lynchings were hanged. the equal justice initiative released a report in 2015 which said that between 1877 and 1950, an estimated 3,959 black people were murdered in “racial terror lynchings” throughout the country’s southern states. the u.n. report follows a january visit to the u.s. by a five-member group, which was chaired by filipino law professor ricardo a. sunga iii. the group says that despite efforts at reform, they still remain “extremely concerned” about the “human rights crisis” facing blacks living in the u.s., and this is especially true considering protesters are once again flooding the streets of american cities to protest the killings of still more black men in recent days. “in particular, the legacy of colonial history, enslavement, racial subordination and segregation, racial terrorism and racial inequality in the united states remains a serious challenge, as there has been no real commitment to reparations and to truth and reconciliation for people of african descent. “impunity for state violence has resulted in the current human rights crisis and must be addressed as a matter of urgency.” the experts’ group pointed out that these killings go unpunished because the investigation is biased and tainted from the beginning since police departments are investigating their own. adding to this is the fact that prosecutors have discretion when it comes to presenting charges and u.s. law enforcement officers are not held to international standards for use of force. to address the situation, they recommended that the u.s. institute a system to reliably track police killings nationwide and instances of excessive use of force. they also said that racial profiling must be brought to an end, which is “a rampant practice and seriously damages the trust between african-americans and law enforcement officials.” the group also said that improving race relations will also require education that must be “accompanied by acts of reconciliation” in order to successfully overcome the bigotry that plagues the u.s. and the past injustices that have been perpetrated against black people on american soil. the report added that the lasting negative effects caused by enslavement and racial injustice must be recognized by both federal and state laws.       u.n. report: police killings of black men in u.s. is ‘human rights crisis’ reminiscent of lynching      
__label__1 a louisiana deputy city marshal is in hot water after body cam footage revealed him shooting at a suspect who had his hands up in the air. this is, sadly, becoming too common a story in the news as awareness of problems with officers who have hair-trigger fingers grows. what makes this story sadly and horrifically unique, though, is that deputy derrick stafford also shot and killed the suspect’s six-year old son. and stafford is claiming self-defense for that, because of course he is: “stafford, out of fear for his life and that of his fellow officers, began shooting at the vehicle to prevent any further actions by [christopher] few which would put the officers in imminent danger.” officers went after christopher few after watching an argument between him and his girlfriend outside a bar just before the 2015 shooting. they claimed witnessing domestic abuse as the reason they decided to chase down few, whose six-year old son, jeremy, was in the front passenger seat. 18 rounds were fired although few had his hands up, but no firearm was found in the car, and few and jeremy were both shot while still in the car. stafford and his partner, norris greenhouse, said that after few drove forward and then backed up, they were in fear for their lives, so they fired. that’s always the story, though. it makes us wonder just what police departments are teaching that so many officers shoot first and ask questions later, claiming they were in fear for their lives when it’s obvious that their suspects were unarmed, and even had their hands in the air. reports claim that neither stafford nor greenhouse knew jeremy was in the car when they opened fire. few was critically wounded, and jeremy, who was autistic, non-verbal and in a special-needs first-grade class, was murdered. stafford’s plea of “self-defense” is a huge middle finger to few and the rest of jeremy’s grieving family. arguments will be heard in court next week, where judge william bennett will decide whether the indictments stand.       louisiana cop claims murdering a 6-year old child was self-defense

__label__1 president obama is now in the record books. he just reached a record-settingâ 78 months of job growth. since 2010, businesses have added more than 15.1 million jobs. thatâs longer than any president ever has before. this news comes after the august jobs report was just released, showing an additional 151,000 added in that month alone. jason furman, the chairman of the council economic advisers, added: this is while âthe unemployment rate and labor force participation rate have both held steady.â â   he further stated: âso far in 2016, job growth has averaged a solid 182,000 jobs a month, well above the pace of about 80,000 jobs a month needed to maintain a low and stable unemployment rate, and hourly earnings for private-sector workers have increased at an annual rate of 2.8 percent, much faster than the pace of inflation.â we must remind you, this isnât partisan analysis. this is undisputed data. in the past, the gop used to complain about the low unemployment (this was their primary talking point) but since obama took office, and with those numbers showing only positive growth, they have instead switched their argument to the economyâs participation rate. except â thereâs only one problem with that. the participation rate is largely in decline due to the baby boom generation retiring. in fact, itâs been in decline for quite some time, spanning back even before george w. bushâs presidency. the truth is, the economy hasnât been this good in some time. itâs nearly 15 percent bigger, actually, than it was in 2008. â itâs time to start giving president obama credit where credit is due. republicans may not like it, but the fact remains, obama just made history. featured image getty images.      breaking: obama just set an all-time record among presidents

__label__1 former senator daniel patrick moynihan once said “everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.” to which the head of the commission on presidential debates has officially responded: “says who?” in a stunning interview with cnn’s reliable sources, janet brown gave a baffling explanation for why she believes fact checking should be taken off the table at presidential debates. “i think personally if you start getting into fact checking, i’m not sure. what is a big fact? what is a little fact? and if you and i have different sources of information does your source about the unemployment rate agree with my source? i don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the encyclopedia britannica.” head of commission on presidential debates doesn’t want moderators correcting lies because “what is a big fact, what is a little fact?” #cnn pic.twitter.com/krm5fev9aw — john aravosis (@aravosis) september 25, 2016  the statement was exactly what the trump campaign had been demanding for weeks and was ecstatic to hear. going into monday’s crucial first presidential debate, the republican candidate understood that the most dangerous hurdle he had to get around was if the moderator called him on his lies. trump, who has dismissed preparing for the debate out of hand, lies a lot. that’s his strength. he needs it to win. politico recently analyzed trump’s last five days on the campaign trail and found that donald trump lies at a rate of once every 3 minutes and 15 seconds. trump’s misrepresentations range from false pronouncements (he again wrongly said he opposed the war in iraq before it began) to the petty (he insisted clinton had copied him by holding rallies with her plane in the background and insinuated she was “sleeping” when she held no public events). he contradicted his own policy on providing health care to the poor, overstated the ad-spending discrepancy between his campaign and clinton’s and exaggerated the size of his primary victories and polling leads. (for what it’s worth, they also fact-checked clinton and found that while she, like any politician, does fudge the truth occasionally, trump’s lying “so greatly exceed[s] clinton’s as to make the comparison almost ludicrous.” ouch.) and while debate commissioner brown used an intentionally vague example (“unemployment rate”), there is no indication that trump will reserve lies to things so nuanced. one example that might come up: donald trump continues to insist that the crime rate in america is going through the roof. this is a blatant lie that is exposed by just quick glance at the fbi’s crime statistics. the debate moderator doesn’t need to serve as the “encyclopedia britannica,” he or she just needs to know the basic facts. big and small. and not let trump get away with misleading the american people who are tuning in. journalists, whose job it is to deal in facts, are furious with this caving to trump. if reporters aren't supposed to factcheck at debates, why exactly are reporters moderators to begin with? why not just have an actor do it? — sopan deb (@sopandeb) september 25, 2016  debate commission director seems to think there are no facts, just different sources to support any claim. that helps elect president trump. https://t.co/lpkcqi2kl4 — mr media training (@mrmediatraining) september 25, 2016  what is the point of a debate moderator other than fact checking? why is this even a discussion? — dan pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) september 25, 2016  meanwhile, trump’s supporters are actively celebrating. they, just like their candidate, understand that the only path to victory for trump is if he can get americans to believe his lies. @ajdelgado13 here is a crazy idea…..let the voters at home fact check. let social media fact check. candy taught us this. — judson mcculloch (@judsonmcculloch) september 25, 2016  hint: if you find yourself in a political party that’s major talking point leading up to a debate is that your candidate should be allowed to lie on stage, you might want to consider finding a new political party. featured image via cnn  anonymous claims to have found evidence linking officer darren wilson directly to the ku klux klan.      debate commission stuns journalists by siding with trump: fact checking is out of bounds (video)

__label__1 defending donald trump is no easy task, but even his most prominent campaign members are struggling to make sense of his behavior and comments. when msnbcâs had campaign manager kellyanne conway on board to talk ahead of the monday night debate between trump and democratic candidate hillary clinton, trumpâs righthand woman couldnât have been any more defensive and avoidant. in all honesty, she failed miserably to make her candidate look good, and choked under the pressure. bloomberg politics host mark halperin, who was also a guest on with conway, asked the trump campaign manager about trump falsely accusing the debate moderator, nbcâs lester holt, of being a democrat. he asked: âhe said lester holt was a democrat. lester holt is a republican. how could he say such a thing that just black-and white factually incorrect?â it was a fair question, and conway wasnât ready for it. her response was basically that trump was not a liar; he just spoke without knowing the truth. conway responded: âi donât know that he knew what lester holtâs voter registration is.â halperin wasnât letting it go. he pressed conway, repeating back to her what sheâd just said:â âwithout knowing then, he asserted he was a democrat?â conway then tried to use one of her bossâ favorite interview tactics â dancing around questions. she fired back: âfirst of all, if you tell me the media are not overly populated with democrats, thatâs false.â at this point, halperin is getting frustrated and tries to keep conway focused. he points out just exactly what was wrong in trumpâs comments about holt: âiâm asking about a very specific thing.â he made a factual claim about the moderator who deserves the right to be treated fairly and it was just wrong. and itâs a metaphor for his frequently in public stating things with no basis, that are wrong.â again, instead of responding, conway began talking about the backlash nbcâs matt lauer received after being âtoo niceâ to trump. it then becomes obvious that mika bzrezinki is also losing her patience, when she says, âthis is a filibusterâ while conway rants on. halperin once again tries to bring the conversation back: âyouâre not answering what i asked you.â iâm asking you how someone running for president can assert on the eve of the debate that the moderator is a democrat, which is factually incorrect? how can he do that?â âhe shouldnât have assertedâ he didnât say, âi donât know what he is, but i think heâs biased,â he said heâs a democrat.â conway left this topic again to attack hillary clinton and the media, andâ brzezinski had to refocusâ her by saying,â âi donât understand what that has to do with markâs question. we were asking why he lied about lester holt.â conway finally says, âi donât think he liedâ andâ brzezinski corrected her,â âum, i think he did.â conway then gave this moronic reply: âmika, a lie would mean he knew the manâs party registration.â co-host joe scarborough had to cut the conversation short, but not before an exasperated halperin could ask,â âso as president, would he say things that are false without knowing the truth?â you can watch the interview below: .@kellyannepolls: trump âdidnât lieâ about lester holt, âa lie would mean that he knew the manâs party registrationâ https://t.co/dzwtcwpoim â morning joe (@morning_joe) september 26, 2016        watch trumpâs campaign manager crash and burn while claiming trump doesnât lie (video)      
__label__1 thereâs already been hints from nbc news that lester holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between donald trump and hillary clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. this, of course, will allow trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable â except by hillary clinton. but to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong: while on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including univision and telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics â¦.â thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to holt, the only other person on the stage. after politico documented that trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. but sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to donald trump and his band of deplorable surrogates. the clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold trump accountable, with clinton campaign communications director jennifer palmieri telling reporters: for the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give donald trump an unfair advantage. we do believe it is the role of the moderator â¦ to call out those lies and to do that in real time. unfortunately, with trumpâs impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, itâs somehow up to hillary clinton to âshineâ at the debate if she hopes to âwin.â this double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent. hopefully, clinton will wipe the floor with trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the american people that she did it. if there is one thing this election has shown us, itâs that journalism is dying, if not already dead.       networks confirm they will not be fact-checking donald trump in any way      
__label__1 donald trump supporters are so desperate to be in power that they are threatening america at gunpoint to vote for him or be killed. thatâs what georgia trump fan jimmy arno is preparing for after the election votes are tallied in november because he expects a bloody civil war to break out in order to overthrow the government before hillary clinton is inaugurated. arno is even considering joining a right-wing militia, whom he collectively refers to as âpatriots,â because he seriously believes only they can defend the constitution. âshould martial law, civil war â whatever â break out in this country, they will uphold the constitution and rebuild our loss,â he said. âthe war thatâs going to break out if hillary clintonâs elected, if that happens. your patriots are going to overthrow the government.â and of course, arno is a fan of the confederacy, loves the confederate flag, and has a portrait of robert e. lee hanging in his living room. so basically, what arno is saying is that he believes the south will rise again and a civil war sequel will turn out differently. this time a rebellion will somehow succeed even though the united states military, including a navy and air force, would be standing in their way. nevertheless, threats of civil war and violent rebellion are frightening but they also prove that conservatives are unfit to govern because apparently the only way they can do so is with a gun pressed against the heads of the people. arno went on to blame president obama directly for the high racial tensions. âi know that we were a whole lot further along racially eight years ago than we are today,â he claims. but the fact is that republicans raised those racial tensions themselves by vowing to make president obama fail from the start simply because of the color of his skin and their claim that he is an illegitimate president. the birther movement, of which trump is a prominent leader, contends that president obama is not one of us and that he wasnât born here. the election of president obama made racists, including arno, mad so they started publicly throwing a hissy fit and their tantrums have only gotten worse in the last eight years. hereâs the audio via npr.  trump supporters are deplorable people who want to shoot and kill anyone who disagrees with them just so they can watch the world burn. if hillary clinton is elected president as she should be, conservatives need to accept that they lost instead of resorting to taking up arms against the country. such an action is treason and would only demonstrate that they are nothing more than sore losers who should never be allowed to get close to political power ever again.       georgia trump supporter preparing for civil war if hillary clinton wins election (audio)      
__label__1 this election will ask us to choose one of the following: an overqualified, dignified woman, or a fascist, xenophobic billionaire. the woman, hillary clinton, has dedicated her life to fighting for the rights and dignities of all, while the man, donald trump, has fought only for himself and his pockets. one group that tends to vote democrat â but has been leaning a little more towards the right recently â are jewish people. in 2008, 78 percent of jewish americans voted for president obama, as did 74 percent in 2012. this year is different. instead of facing off against john mccain or mitt romney, the democrats are facing off against the definition of fascism and xenophobia. and they have a message to their grandchildren: vote for hillary clinton. why? because theyâve seenâ before. in a video titled âa message from grandma & grandpa: weâve seen this before,â a group of elderly jewish americans plead with their younger generations to get out and vote, and warns against the type of man donald trump is. they âenlisted some powerful allies in the effort to defeat donald trump: grandparents.â and they arenât holding back: âthis is probably one of the most important elections, because there is so much is at stake.â of course, their experiences with germany take front and center: âwe have seen this before. we saw it in germany, andâ donât want to see it again.â their hatred for trump is not hidden, and for good reason: âtrump is more than a tyrant. heâs an obnoxiousâ lying individual and i havenât any respect for him. i have tremendous fears for the country and and for you, my grandchildren.â adding some lighthearted (but important) humor, one grandparent tells their grandkids: âif you vote the future is yours. if you donât vote for hillary, and that crazy man trump is elected, iâll haunt you when i die.â another promises to be a major spoiler: âiâll spoil every episode of âgame of thrones. when youâre having a dinner party, iâll come down and say something racist, but if youâre voting for trump, you probably donât care.â the powerful video, sponsored by bend the arc jewish action, was released to warn future generations not to forget their history, and to listen to the wisdom of their elders, especially ones that know oppression when they see it: âwe, as jews, recognize that [trumpâs] candidacy has echoed times when the jewish community experienced the dangers of fascism, anti-immigration and persecution against religious minorities.â weâve seen this beforeâ and we wanted to make sure that as jews we were speaking out boldly and loudly and making sure it was known the jewish community rejects trump for the platform of hatred and bigotry that he has unleashed.â watch the powerful ad here:        jewish elders warn their grandchildren: vote for hillary, âweâve seen this beforeâ (video)      
__label__1 kansas is bleeding money and jobs and governor sam brownback doesnât want the people to know how devastating his economic policies have been. in 2011, the tea party governor was so confident that his economic policy of massive tax cuts for the wealthy and reduced spending would turn kansas into an economic powerhouse that he created a special group charged with writing reports on the results. but brownbackâs experiment has failed so spectacularly that the state is billions of dollars in debt, education funding is suffering, and job growth is pathetic. so pathetic that kansas is losing more jobs than it has gained. in january, brownback couldnât handle a report put together by his group that admitted âkansas sometimes was faring worse than it had before brownback became governor,â so he made every effort to cover it up. in other words, he censored it because his group was supposed to report that the economy is soaring, not falling to the ground like a rock. kansas center for economic growth executive director heidi holliday blasted brownback for killing the report. âhe specifically asked the council to hold him accountable through rigorous performance metrics. five years later, the metrics clearly show his tax experiment has failed while business leaders and local chambers of commerce across the state openly ask him to change course.â in fact, brownback is so desperate to keep the people of kansas from calling for tarring and feathering him in a public square that he is turning to the federal government. instead of writing their own independent reports, the group is now restricted to getting their information from the federal reserve, which conservatives often claim is responsible whenever economic issues occur. that particularly surprised kansas house minority leader tom burroughs, who was quick to point out the irony. âthe missed revenue marks, missed job reports, missed projections shed light on his failed policies. i kind of find it a little ironic they chose to go to a federal government report after they blamed president obama for our economic problems.â governor brownbackâs economic experiment is a complete failure and a joke. kansasâ economy is now in shambles and republicans have no one to blame but themselves. they believed that by implementing an extreme conservative fiscal policy without interference from democrats that they would prove trickle-down economics as a total success. instead, it failed miserably and now they want to censor any results from being reported. by all rights, brownback should have ousted by voters in 2014. but now kansas is stuck with him and his failed policies for at least another two years. meanwhile, the wealthy are laughing all the way to the bank.       republican gov wrecked economy so bad heâs started censoring reports      
__label__1 donald trump’s lies are catching up to him one by one, and the latest person to call him out is pulitzer prize-winning journalist and biographer david cay johnston. some of you may not know who johnston is, but he is the author behind so he knows quite a bit about who the erratic business mogul is and isn’t. in a newly released video, johnston claims that there is absolutely no proof that trump is the billionaire he says he is – adding another layer of deceit and fraud to trump’s already horrendous track record. the clip was published by , where johnston goes through trump’s bragging claims and compares them to the actual data on the business mogul’s court records and bank filings. for example, johnston says that last year, trump said his net worth was $8.7 billion, $10 billion, $11 billion and higher, “even though there was nothing going on in the economy that would suggest that kind of gyrations of net worth.” the truth is, trump is lying though his teeth. johnston said: “the fact of the matter is that donald trump just makes it up.” johnston also brought up a court testimony where trump said he uses his gut “feelings” and “emotional state” to determine his net worth. johnston joked about how “nuts” it was, and imitated trump’s strategy: “by the way, i’m having a great day today. i think my net worth must be at least a billion dollars.” johnston has been trying to get america to believe that trump’s billionaire status was fake since 1990. during that time, a net worth statement by trump’s bankers said that the gop nominee’s net worth was actually  $295 million. johnston is still standing by the claim that trump isn’t as successful as he seems, and continues to insist that although trump is well off, there is “no evidence that he is a billionaire.” you can watch johnston call out trump’s lies below:        biographer says trump might not actually be a billionaire: ‘he just makes it up’ (video)      
__label__1 the cornerstone of donald trump’s presidential campaign can be summed up in just a few words: things suck and it’s all obama’s fault. for trump, this tweet pretty much optimizes his take on poverty: our country does not feel ‘great already’ to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair. — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) july 28, 2016  this was in response to president obama saying during the democratic national convention that “america is already great.” so, who is correct? are americans trapped in a socioeconomic hell hole or are things far more optimistic? according to a study published by the , things are vastly better for americans than they were when obama took office in 2009. the article began by profiling alex caicedo of gaithersburg, md. a few years ago, caicedo was struggling with odd and part time jobs. he and his family were forced to live with his mother-in-law. today, he has a steady middle class job with benefits and the family is ready to move out of his mother-in-law’s home. they are far from alone. the caicedos are among the 3.5 million americans who were able to raise their chins above the poverty line last year, according to census data released this month. more than seven years after the recession ended, employers are finally being compelled to reach deeper into the pools of untapped labor, creating more jobs, especially among retailers, restaurants and hotels, and paying higher wages to attract workers and meet new minimum wage requirements. what about the minorities, who, according to trump, have never had it worse? well, that’s another trump lie. not only have minorities suffered much, much worse throughout history (slavery, jim crow), but they too have it dramatically better since obama took office. poverty declined among every group. but african-americans and hispanics — who account for more than 45 percent of those below the poverty line of $24,300 for a family of four in most states — experienced the largest improvement. sorry, republicans, but you don’t get an ounce of credit for the improvements. if anything, things would be much better if republicans weren’t in office. the times credits social programs like social security and food stamps for keeping people out of poverty. they also credit the fall in oil prices for people being able to commute to their jobs. one major factor, and republicans will hate this, is that the increases in minimum wage are also taking people out of poverty. after a long period of rising inequality, elise gould, an economist at the left-leaning economic policy institute in washington, added, the benefits of the improving economy finally began to seep downward. wage increases were “even stronger at the bottom than in the middle,” she said. still, it’s not enough. 43 million americans still live in poverty. republicans have successfully blocked poor people from acquiring college degrees or job training that might help raise people out of poverty. for those without access to computers or the internet, finding a job can be burdensome. for those who can’t afford cars, a job search can be impossible. if this proves anything, it should be that it’s time to continue successful democratic policies, not cut them off at the knees, as republicans would do.       new study proves america keeps getting better and better under obama      
__label__1 donald trump constantly talks about how heâll âmake america great again.â heâll bring jobs back, put america first, all that populist, nationalist jazz that put him in the position of being the republican nominee in the first place. however, thereâs one thing trump can do to help americans get more jobs: he can actually make his own products in the united states of america. well, since trump wonât readily make his manufacturing practices available to the american public on his own campaign website, hillary has given us a handy guide complete with images, on hers. she calls it âa buyerâs guide for donald trump.â while donald trump says thatâ âitâs very hard to have apparel made in this country,â orâ  âthey donât even make the stuff here. itâs so hard to get.â hillary proves him wrong right away. here is a handy map of where trump can get all of his things made, right here in america, courtesy of hillaryclinton.com:  hillary then goes ahead to list the individual categories on this map, complete with lists of places that each kind of product can be made. for instance, hereâs all the places trump can make ties:  instead, he makes them in china. and that is justâ example. go to hillaryâs website for a full list. in other words, trumpâs rhetoric is just that: bluster and bombaste for the sake of excusing his anti-american business practices. if trump wants to bring jobs back to america, he can start with his own companies. thanks for the handy guide, hillary! no doubt trump will never read it.       trump wonât tell america where his products are made, so hereâs a handy guide (images)

__label__1 in discussing shootings and crime in the first of three presidential debates, donald trump not only greatly exaggerated the number of shootings in chicago, and claimed that stop and frisk was both constitutional and effective, he also advocated taking guns away from people without due process. of course, he thinks that the police wouldâ take guns away from criminals, and that the constitution is different for criminals, butâ  has a constitutional right to due process. doesnât matter to trump, though: âwe have to take guns awayâ¦from bad people that shouldnât have them.â those were trumpâs words in the debate, where he defended stop-and-frisk as constitutional despite the fact that it was literally ruled otherwise, and has also been deemed ineffective. how the nra can support a candidate that would take guns away from anybody at all without due process is beyond us. thatâs especially true given the fact that this isnât the first time trump has said this: â[police officers are] proactive, and if they see a person possibly with a gun or they think they have a gun, they will see the person and theyâll look and theyâll take the gun away. theyâll stop, theyâll frisk and theyâll take the gun away, and they wonât have anything to shoot with.â the 2nd amendment cannot exist without due process. the nra is literally supporting a candidate who would take guns away from law-abiding citizens.       trump literally just said heâd take guns away from anyone without due process      
__label__1 through the course of this election season, a dark cloud has hung over trump’s campaign – ok, many dark clouds. dark, racist, xenophobic, lying clouds. but the one we’re referencing here is “what the hell is going on with his taxes?” the simple answer, as trump revealed during the first presidential debate, is that the donald simply hasn’t paid any federal income tax. trump blamed clinton for “squandering” taxpayer dollars, thus depriving us of much-needed infrastructure improvements — the kind republicans like trump typically vote against. clinton, of course, took the opportunity to get in a dig about the gop nominee’s own taxes. “maybe because you haven’t paid any federal income tax in a lot of years,” clinton shot back, expertly placing the bait in the trap. and, of course, she didn’t have to wait long for trump to try to grab the cheese. to emphasize his point, he accidentally admitted that she’s exactly right: “it would be squandered too, believe me.” pay attention to the word “would.” trump would not have said that if he had paid taxes, which he called “smart” earlier in the debate. is this the reason he doesn’t want to reveal his taxes, which he says he will release “against his lawyer’s wishes” if clinton releases deleted emails? does trump not want the voting public to know that he’s a deadbeat who absolutely does not pay his fair share? when trump says “believe me,” believe him — not that his tax dollars would be “squandered” but that he believes they “would” if he had paid any. watch the clip below:  featured image via getty images/drew angerer

__label__1 well that didn’t take long. donald trump, who had just been beaten to a bloody pulp for 90 minutes by an opponent so far out of his league it’s preposterous, did the only thing he knows how to do: claim he was treated unfairly: nothing on emails. nothing on the corrupt clinton foundation. and nothing on #benghazi. #debates2016 #debatenight — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) september 27, 2016  poor donald. he looked like such a petulant little child up there. his obvious case of the sniffles aside, his lack of preparation, lack of personality, lack of ability to actually compose a coherent thought and lack of any human decency came through perfectly. no, donald. nobody wants to listen to right-wing conspiracy theories. secretary clinton covered emails. the clinton foundation, unlike your sham charities, actually does charitable work. please go home, have a good cry and try again october 9th. we here at winning democrats would like to congratulate secretary clinton on not just a win but a blowout.            
__label__1 the republican witch hunt to make the irs commissioner pay for…something… backfired in spectacular fashion after democrats, insulted at having been dragged into this show trial, took the opportunity to instead flip the script. during irs commissioner john koskinen’s hearing, democrats began ignoring the “impeachment” nonsense and focused entirely on getting to the bottom of donald trump’s numerous tax scandals, including specific questions about his tax returns and charity fraud. of particular interest was trump’s stated excuse for not releasing his tax returns because he is under audit. tax experts have long noted that this argument is complete nonsense. an audit does not preclude the ability to show the american people your finances before an election. the head of the irs – who presumably knows a thing or two about this – agreed. “is there anything that would prohibit someone from releasing tax returns, if they want to, because they’re under audit?” rep. jerry nadler, a democrat from new york asked. “no,” koskinen responded simply. another democratic representative asked it another way. “would releasing the person’s tax return during the audit in any way impact that pending audit of the return?” rep. ted deutch asked. “the release itself wouldn’t. the concern sometimes by taxpayers is that when the information is public there may be more information that will be discovered or provided,” koskinen said. in other words, trump was worried that releasing his tax returns could make him look bad, or possibly allow nosy reporters to find even more criminality that the irs missed the first time. this answer actually confirms what trump’s son suggested to reporters in an unusual break from his dad. it wasn’t the audit that scares trump, it’s that reporters seeing the tax returns would allow them to discover what’s in them and that would destroy his father’s chances of becoming president. it may be for this reason that trump has hinted he will only release his tax returns after the election. it won’t matter then. the beatings continued in earnest while republicans were forced to sit there with “what have we done?” expressions painted on their faces. democrats then went on to highlight some of the items that could prove problematic for trump to disclose, such as his actual income, what he pays the government in taxes, clues to his actual net worth and records of his charitable giving. rep. zoe lofgren (d-calif.) wondered aloud if discovering payments by russia might suggest a monetary ― or even treasonous ― motive for going soft on a u.s. rival. several also raised the recent reports of trump using his tax-free foundation to to buy paintings and sports memorabilia, to fund political campaigns and to pay business expenses. “is it appropriate for a foundation to give political donations?” asked rep. sheila jackson lee (d-texas). the answer was no. rep. luis gutierrez smiled in the face of republican discomfort at the questions while munching on a bag of skittles (a not-so-subtle nod to trump jr.’s recent comparison of syrian refugees to poisoned candy). he later clarified that, unlike some people, he wouldn’t stop eating skittles if he got a bad one. it was not a good day to be a republican lawmaker. the irs commissioner is facing a republican-orchestrated impeachment due to what they say was a cover up to hide irs targeting of conservative groups. the minor detail that no evidence of the irs head actually targeting conservative groups actually exists didn’t seem to bother them. the impeachment hearing, widely agreed to be a dog-and-pony show, came after republican leaders managed to stop an embarrassing impeachment vote on the house floor which would have humiliated the gop with yet another stark example for the american voters of how frivolous and dysfunctional the party has become. they settled for grandstanding. so with the knowledge that republicans were wasting everyone’s time, democrats decided to use those wasted hours to highlight just how corrupt donald trump is. waste not, want not. watch the irs hearing, starting with rep. nadler’s investigation into trump’s lies, here:  featured image via youtube  billionaire nick hanauer says things need to change, but not the way we expect.      backfire: republicans create show trial for irs head, so dems use it to find out about trump’s taxes      
__label__1 if there is one thing you can say about trump supporters, it is that they are sure about what they don’t know. and what they don’t know can fill volumes, as evidenced by the latest conversation with some of them, shared on the september 20 episode of comedy central’s the daily show. you can’t blame these people for some of the conspiracy theories they believe — many of those theories started in right-wing media, like fox news. but when asked, many trump voters were willing to offer up their own ideas about conspiracies that go far and beyond what even sean hannity would probably touch. reporter jordan klepper visited trump rallies to talk to the attendees and what they told him will make you laugh at first –then it just might make you cry. trump famously said that he loves the “poorly educated” and klepper found them in abundance as they waited to hear from their god-emperor. the first couple of people klepper talks to were interested in rumors about hillary’s health. one man tells him that he thinks she has aids, which she got from bill. and where did bill get it? “from messing with that magic johnson,” the man replies. we assume he meant the former nba star and not the ex-president’s, er, “johnson.” it doesn’t take klepper long to find people who appear to be totally divorced from reality. like the man who believes clinton has a body double, and when shown two identical photos of the candidate by klepper, he quickly and confidently picks out the one he thinks is the “double.” then there’s the guy who says president obama reveals he is a muslim by the way he wears his jewelry. he is referring to a long debunked story that claimed that the president stopped wearing his watch and wedding ring in observance of ramadan. but there’s no restriction prohibiting muslims from wearing jewelry during the holy month, except in this man’s mind. so the president appearing sans watch and wedding ring proves absolutely nothing. but the winner is the guy who claimed that hillary has aids, for his demand to know why president obama wasn’t in the oval office when the world trade center was attacked on september 11, 2001. these people will be voting on november 8. will you be? here’s the video, via comedy central: featured image via comedy central screen capture  here’s another “passionate” supporter of donald trump in action: according to police, he was building a bomb to use against muslims.      trump supporters offer outrageous conspiracy theories to daily show reporter (video)      
__label__1 on wednesday, talk show legend montel williams posed a very simple question for conservatives: when are you going to take responsibility for their role in helping to create the violent situation in charlotte, north carolina? just hours after donald trump proposed nationwide “stop and frisk” — a policy that was declared unconstitutional in new york. responding to a question about “black-on-black crime,” trump said he would “do stop-and-frisk” to solve the problem. “we did it in new york,” he said. “it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive.” stop-and-frisk did not, in fact, “work incredibly well.” in 2011, for example, black and latino residents made up about 90 percent of people stopped, and 88 percent of those were innocent. even in predominantly white neighborhoods, blacks and latinos were stopped more than whites. “donald trump is having trouble with the facts,” new york city council speaker melissa mark viverito said in a statement regarding trump’s remarks. “stop and frisk as it was applied in new york city was unconstitutional, it didn’t reduce crime and it severely corroded the relationship between the police and the communities they serve.” yes, “stop-and-frisk” is a racist practice, but his suggestion that it should be implemented nationwide really resonates with some of trump’s die-hard supporters — namely white supremacists. “when are conservatives going to own their damn part in this? that asshole trump just proposed national stop and frisk?” williams, who has also been critical of protesters who have chosen to become violent, asked on twitter. “wtf?” one of trump’s “deplorables” calling himself “big daddy” climbed out of his basket and once again proved hillary clinton’s assessment of the donald’s meth-fueled legion of ignoramuses correct. “he will control n*ggers unlike you cucks,” big daddy informed williams. naturally, more of trump’s “deplorables” came out to play:  but trump’s acolyte apparently did not know to whom he was speaking. “and now we know why these white supremacist bumpkins with no teeth married to their cousins love trump,” williams shot back:  “big daddy” has since slithered back into the basket and closed it, changing his name and protecting his tweets presumably because he realized that when you say racist things on the internet, people notice.  it’s interesting how “brave” trump’s paper tigers are until someone puts them in their place. featured image via screengrab              
__label__1 while giving a speech at a church rally in cleveland, donald trump confused everyone by actually siding with a victim of police brutality instead of law enforcement â and itâs gotten him in trouble with americaâs largest police union. in speaking to the rally goers in cleveland, trump strayed from his normal, pro-cop rhetoric to say a few unflattering words about betty shelby, the tulsa police officer who shot an unarmed black man. clearly worried about how horrendously his attempts to reach black voters have failed, trump gave an unusually thoughtful response to a group of african american pastors, in which he suggested that shelby had âchokedâ: ânow, did she get scared? was she choking? what happened? but maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they canât be doing what theyâre doing, okay? they canât be doing what theyâre doing. i watched the shooting in particular in tulsa. and that man was hands up.â that man went to the car, hands up, put his hand on the car. i mean, to me, it looked like he did everything youâre supposed to do, and he looked like a really good man.â trump made these comments just five days after theâ fraternal order of police (fop), which has 330,000 members, endorsed him. but after hearing trump criticize the tulsa police officer, fop executive director jim pasco is livid and thinks trumpâs comments were inappropriate. pasco said that trumpâ âmust be mindful of the due process rights and presumption of innocence accorded to all, including police officers.â now, no one should be proud or relieved that trump finally decided to acknowledge police brutality victims â heâs been known to pander to whatever audience he is in front of at any given moment, and is notorious for flip-flopping almost instantly. this speech was easy for trump to say in front of black pastors â i doubt he would have dared to say this in front of a predominately white audience. trump also knows he is struggling tremendously with the minority vote, which may very well determine this election. trump will say whatever he needs to win â but this time, he lost a major support group. hereâs the clip that got trump in trouble with the police union:        trump loses support of police union after saying tulsa shooting cop âchokedâ (video)      
__label__1 last night, fox news reporter steve harrigan was reporting live in charlotte, north carolina to cover â police brutality protests that had erupted after a shooting. perhaps because fox news has typically shamed these kinds of protests and ran footage that depicted protesters as thugs and looters in the past, harrigan got his a** handed to him by a protester that didnât hesitate to confront the notoriously racist network. the female african american protester went right up to harrigan and decided to educate him about why she and other protesters had gathered. when harrigan tried to shame her for being outside in an area where someone had just gotten shot, the protester couldnât tolerate his ignorance and white privilege anyâ longer. harrigan made the mistake of asking her,â âif a man was shot about 50 yards over there, we donât know by who. why are you here?â and that was it. the protester went off, and replied to harrigan,â âbecause i serve a purposeâ right before giving him a brutal lesson in racism. she forcefully said that no matter where she is, at any given moment she could be shot just because of the color of her skin. she said: âi could be at work, at school, in my car, i can still get shot â by the police!â pointing out the fact that racism still exists in america, she continued: âwe are not the same. we are human, but i am black and you are white so donât tell me not to come over hereâ¦â harrigan tried to jump in, but the protester quickly called him out for âusing sarcasmââ as a crowd began to gather, and accused the network of only being at the protests so that they could get video footage andâ âmake a f*cking fabricated storyâ â which we all know fox news has done in the past. you can watch the protester shut down fox news below:        black protester shuts down fox reporter on live tv for âf***ing fabricated storyâ (video)

__label__1 fox news host sean hannity desperately tried to smear terence crutcher on wednesday as a violent criminal who was wanted by police but was repeatedly shut down by a local tulsa news anchor. crutcher was shot and killed by white police police officer betty shelby even though he had his hands up and was surrounded by other police officers. the murder was caught on camera. clearly, the unarmed crutcher was not a threat to the safety of the officers, especially when you consider the fact that police officers have consistently taken in armed white suspects alive without ever firing a shot at them. but sean hannity repeatedly claimed during his radio show that crutcher had a violent criminal record and had warrants out for his arrest. “i understand that in this particular case mr crutcher has a long criminal history and appeared to be under the influence or so the police are charging,” hannity said, which prompted tulsa news anchor russell mills to smack hannity down with facts. “well i’ll tell you i looked up his history and i’m not seeing a lot of criminal history,” mills replied. “we have something called the oscn – the oklahoma supreme court network. i was able to find a protective order from 12 years ago that was dismissed. i found a couple of financial things. there’s no violent criminal history for mr. crutcher that i’ve been able to uncover.” but hannity didn’t want to hear the truth so he moved on to claiming that crutcher had several warrants out for his arrest. mills informed hannity that there were no such warrants. hannity responded that he read somewhere that there were warrants. “i have not seen any reporting on any warrants for mr. crutcher and i certainly haven’t uncovered any myself,” mills said. “there has been some misinformation floated.” a disappointed hannity resorted to claiming that he has a “source” within the department and said that “it’s a matter of time of when they’re gonna release this information.” here’s the audio via media matters:  once again, sean hannity tries to demonize another black victim of a police shooting in order to make people believe the shooting was totally justified. the bottom line, however, is that crutcher had his hands up and was surrounded by officers. he wasn’t a threat to them or anyone else but they executed him anyway. officer betty shelby should be arrested and charged with murder. period.       hannity gets his a** handed to him for falsely claiming terence crutcher has violent criminal past      
__label__1 pennsylvania republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on election day in support of donald trump. first proposed in june, house bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote. in other words, it would legalize voter intimidation. as brennan center for justice counsel adam gitlin told earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process. âthereâs actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they wonât know the law, and theyâll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,â gitlin said. âthat can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.â as we all know, conservatives who support trump are racists who think their brand of christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a muslim. and thatâs exactly what republican nominee donald trump wants. âweâre going to watch pennsylvania,â trump declared during a rally in the state last month. âgo down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people donât come in and vote five times. if you do that, weâre not going to lose. the only way we can lose, in my opinion â i really mean this, pennsylvania â is if cheating goes on.â trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to âstop crooked hillary from rigging this election!â in response to trumpâs claim that the election will be rigged against him, pennsylvania republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage. with the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, pennsylvania is even more important now. but voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in trumpâs favor and effect races down the ticket. in short, trump and the republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. and if it works in pennsylvania you can bet that republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.       republicans push bill to legalize voter intimidation to help trump in pennsylvania      
__label__1 president obama is right — it appears the people running the trump campaign skipped their history and civics classes. after donald trump got a lashing from black activists after claiming it’s “never been worse” for them than it is right now, one would think the campaign would have gotten the message and moved on accordingly. wrong. as usual, no one in the trump campaign learns their lesson. and their sheer ignorance has cost them a key staff member in a key swing state. trump’s campaign chair in the prominent mahoning county in ohio, kathy miller, has resigned from her position after denying there was any racism in the 1960s and that if black people weren’t successful in the last 50 years, it’s their own fault. she also said there wasn’t “any racism until obama got elected” and skirted problems under the table: if you’re black and you haven’t been successful in the last 50 years, it’s your own fault. you’ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. you’ve had the same schools everybody else went to. you had benefits to go to college that white kids didn’t have. you had all the advantages and didn’t take advantage of it. it’s not our fault, certainly. miller then doubled down, calling the black lives matter movement a “stupid waste of time” and said low voter turnout in the african american community as due to “the way they’re raised.” what does “the way they’re raised,” supposed to mean? maybe miller should take a look at the fact that the trump kids didn’t vote (and couldn’t even vote for their dad) before speculating on how an entire race raises their kids. miller resigned, gave a half-ass apology, and distanced herself from the campaign. of course trump’s ohio state director, bob paduchik stressed that miller’s comments were not reflective of the campaign, and reduced her position to that of a simple “volunteer” to steer away any influence she once held. once again, the trump campaign deflects, blames, and dodges responsibility. oh, and it once again shows that it’s being run by a bunch of entitled white racists.       trump campaign chair says racism didn’t exist before obama – promptly resigns      
__label__1 a senior member of the congressionalâ black caucus stepped up to a lectern on the house floor on thursday and listed all the innocent activities that can be a death sentence for african-americans. rep. barbara lee (d-calif.), armed with a variety of props, depicted all the things that can cause black people in the united states to be killed at the hands of law enforcement because they are viewed with suspicion,â even when engaging in harmless activities. âeach time we lose a precious life to fear, distress, and prejudice, the list of things that will get you killed as a black person in america gets a little longer,â lee said. among the items she held up were: âshould any of this warrant a death sentence? is this the america you want to live in?â lee asked. lee said that when her sons were young she had âtough conversationsâ with them, warning them to be careful in their interactions with the very same police officers who are sworn to serve and protect them. âsince michael brown was shot in ferguson two years ago, 2,195 people have been killed by police in our nation. as the mother of two black men and the grandmother of five black grandchildren, i worry that someone i love could become number 2,196,â she said. the issue of fatal police shootings of african-americans has come to the forefront again after three more killings rocked the nation.â tyre king, a teenager with a bb gun, was killed in columbus, ohio; terence crutcher, who had his hands in the air, was killed in tulsa, okla.; and keith lamont scott, who was reading a book in his car, was killed in charlotte, n.c. as a result, protesters have once again flooded onto the streets of america. watchâ rep. barbara lee address the house, here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iogdx5sfu2i]       congressional black caucus member depicts list of things african americans can be killed for      
__label__1 there’s a lot being said about football players across the nfl standing together in unity against police brutality. this is even more pertinent now, as even more black men have been gunned down in the street just this week by police. using his press conference to bring further awareness to this topic was none other than seattle seahawks’ star cornerback richard sherman. he said: “i’m not going to answer any questions today, and it’s no offense to you guys, but the state of things in the world today is very interesting. i think you have players that are trying to take a stand and be aware of social issues and try to make a stand and increase people’s awareness and put a spotlight on it and they’re being ignored. whether they’re taking a knee or whether they’re locking arms, you know, they’re trying to bring people together and united them for a cause. and i think that the last couple days a couple more guys have gotten shot and killed in the middle of the street and more videos have come out of guys getting killed, and i think people are still missing the point. the reason these guys are kneeling. the reason we’re locking arms is to bring people together. to make people aware that this is not right. you know, it’s not right for people to get killed in the street.” sherman then explains how he’s been proactive in the community and even needing to go so far as to train young people of color on how to behave with the police, but still being fearful that they might get shot. he says, “that’s an unfortunate time to be living.” especially when people are being killed for no reason. he then has some choice words by those who are supposedly offended by those standing up against police brutality by quietly using their first amendment right of dissent and protest to bring awareness to the plight. sherman says: “when a guy takes a knee, you can ignore it. you can say he’s not being patriotic. he’s not honoring the flag. i’m doing none of those things. i’m saying straight up, this is wrong and we need to do something.” and something most certainly needs to be done, and done now. watch sherman speak here: wow— this is a must-watch. seattle seahawks’ richard sherman addresses police killings of african american men at presser, then walks out. pic.twitter.com/goaosgufax — kyle griffin (@kylegriffin1) september 22, 2016        seahawks’ richard sherman drops the mic on those who ignore police brutality (video)      
__label__1 since the reagan administration, americans have been sold a bill of goods that tells us that inherited money is more valuable than earned money. republicans would like all inherited money to be completely sheltered from any taxation, while for the most part, democrats disagree. the compromise has been that only estates valued at a whopping $5.45 million or more ($10.9 million for married couples) are taxed. anything below that is completely tax free. now, hillary clinton, after prodding from bernie sanders and his followers, has revised her estate tax plan and trust me when i say donald trumpâs children wonât be happy. previously, clinton said she would restore the tax on dead rich folks to its 2009 levels, pushing up the rate from 40 percent to 45 percent, and making it kick in for estates worth at least $3.5 million (today, it only hits those valued at $5.45 million or more). but, no longer. instead, sheâs borrowed a page from her formal primary rival, and now proposes turning the levy into a progressive taxâmeaning it will take a bigger bite out of wealthier estatesâwith a top rate of 65 percent. the last time the estate tax hit that level was in 1982, though back then it also kicked in on smaller inheritances. beyond all that, clinton has said she would largely do away with the step-up in basis at death, a rule that allows lucky heirs to avoid paying capital gains taxes that, say, their parents or uncle or other rich benefactor would have owed had they sold their stock before passing away. in the end, the committee expects these measures to raise about $225 billion over ten years. source: slate as it stands, the estate tax system is a joke. in 2012, a staggering $1.2 trillion was passed down as an inheritance. of that, less than 1 percent was taxed. as for the republican argument that estate taxes will hurt small businesses, in 2013, only 20 small businesses and family farm estates, in the entire country, had to pay estate taxes. the other common republican argument is that estate taxes are âdouble taxationâ (as if every other dollar in the american economy hasnât been taxed multiple times), but the reality is that most of what comprises large estates comes from capital gains, which are also unlikely to have every been taxed. of course, even if clinton is elected, sheâll have a tough time passing this, at least as long as paul ryan is in charge of the house. he wants trumpâs kids to pay zero in estate taxes. of course, for all we know, trump himself pays zero in taxes.       hillary clintonâs new tax plan will make trumpâs kids furious      
__label__1 another day, another racist dog whistle echoed by donald trump. while the urban unrest in charlotte, north carolina continues, trump â in a pathetic attempt to sound presidential â blamed the rioting on drug use, without citing any facts to back up his claim. the comment, made in a speech in pittsburgh, was off-script: âif youâre not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what youâre watching on television.â somehow, everyone but donald trump is unaware of the âfactorsâ contributing to a legitimate unrest that stems not from drugs, but from the black community being continuously fed up with racial injustices and the murders of unarmed men who posed no credible threat to law enforcement. what donald trump is seeking to do is sow the seeds of a racist, stereotype that plagues this country: blacks are on drugs, and it makes them violent. the facts are out there: white people do more drugs, and serve less time. this notion that because black americans are fed up with injustice is somehow attributed to drug use or a yearning for drugs is, yes, racist. it reaffirms peopleâs ignorant and misguided stereotypes about urban black communities while simultaneously deflecting from other drug crises that are affecting white communities at much more critical levels. recent findings in theâ american journal of public health, the abuse and dependency on âhard drugsâ areâ âless common among delinquent african american youth than those who are non-hispanic white.â white people, in general, are also more likely to deal drugs than black people. so the people selling drugs to our kids, parents, and members of the community are more likely to be white than black, but yet black people are still seen as the culprits of americaâs drug problem. and donald trumpâs claim, no matter how minuscule it may be, just makes the problem worse. instead of accusing black americans of being drug-induced degenerates, maybe trump should travel up to new hampshire and maine, where an unprecedented opioid addiction is killing hundreds of white citizens every year, and nothing is being done to combat it. donald trump says the unrest in charlotte would not happen in a trump administration. would new englandâs drug epidemic be stopped under his administration? would the killing of unarmed black people â which is the only contribution to the unrest â stop in his administration? would he end the dog whistle stereotypes that continue to blatantly fester in peopleâs minds, regardless of what the facts are? trumpâs going to get a huge wake up call with black voters in november if he keeps this up.       trump blames charlotte rioting on drug use, without any proof      
__label__1 while charlotte, north carolina faces a state of emergency and unarmed black people continue to get shot dead by police, mike pence has a few words to say regarding the mounting racial tensions gripping this nation. to him, it’s annoying — but not in the way one might think. as black people — who have done nothing wrong that warranted getting killed — lie dead in the street, pence and trump are annoyed hearing about it. how do we know? because pence was *smart* enough to admit it to reporters: trump and i believe there’s been far too much talk about institutional bias and racism within law enforcement. gee, sorry black people dying and being targeted at disproportionate rates annoys you so much, pence. sorry the plight of black america is a burden to your message of “build that wall.” thirty-eight percent of the u.s. population is non-white. when a third of the population can fall victim to institutional bias and racism in law enforcement, the conversation (or “talk” as pence puts it) is extremely important. sorry if the talk makes your uncomfortable or triggers your prejudices, but it needs to happen. skirting it under the rug or blaming it on drug use doesn’t make it go away. the statistics tell us all we need to know: so, even with all these glaring statistics, mike pence thinks talking about it has been “far too much” for his and trump’s comfort. newsflash, pence: you’re running for vice president of the united states, not vice president of the white community. if the talk is too much, get out of the race. we already know trump doesn’t care about the black community nor does he want to actually fix anything that afflicts it, but pence was supposed to give the illusion that a potential trump administration would care. that’s been shattered. good luck getting the black vote in november when you completely wish to disregard what hurts them the most: systemic racism.       pence says there is ‘too much talk’ about racism in policing and institutional bias      
__label__1 trumpâsâ campaign chair of mahoning county, ohio, one of the most crucial counties in the state, made what might be the most delusional statement of the week. she insisted that racism was literally non-existent before obama was elected. wow, it doesnât take much to tear apart how this assertion is completely absurd, but weâre going to take the time to do it anyway. in an interview with the guardian, kathy miller, the campaign chair in question, made the following shocking statement: âi donât think there was any racism until obama got elected. â we never had problems like this.â she must mean that white people were relatively shielded from being forcedâ to face the fact that racism is, in fact, abound in white culture. â even though that, in all honestly, is a load of bunk too. she went on to make some extremely offensive statements to the black community overall, willfully remaining ignorant of how many hardships black americans face every. single. day: âif youâre black and you havenât been successful in the last 50 years, itâs your own fault. â youâve had every opportunity, it was given to you. â youâve had the same schools everybody else went to. â you had benefits to go to college that white kids didnât have. â you had all the advantages and didnât take advantage. â itâs not our fault, certainly.â *cringe* seeing as apparently this isnât evident to people like kathy miller, and arguably much of trumpâs voter base, letâs just go through why this is completely bogus and extremely offensive. she even went so far as to say that racism didnât exist when she grew upâ¦in the 1960s. â what?! â segregation?!?! black people have had to deal with a racist criminal justice system which unfairly targets their community, damaging their families and placing their children at a disadvantage from the very beginning. black children have primarily had to go to schools which are dominated by a white power structure, a power structure which has certainly not gotten rid of its racist roots to this day. â either that, or they often go to a school which is worse off economically. black people were literally enslaved or cut off from the resources and wealth of the white by law for centuries. â the racist nature within that legal system wasnât just erased with the end of segregation. â has it improved? â sure, but that hasnât addressed the structural racism within our socio-political and economic paradigm. because of a history of oppression, black people have been economically much worse off. â and children who come from poor families, as study after study shows, statistically do worse in school. â they also canât afford skyrocketing college tuition when they get out of high school. black children are often disproportionately punished in schools, which harms their potential for academic success. honestly, i could go on and on, and iâm not even black, so i donât know the half of it. this lady is delusional, her beliefs are dangerous to the health of our society, and the fact that we have this kind of racism so prevalent in the trump campaign, a united states presidential campaign, is horrifying. but itâs all obamaâs fault, right? update: kathy miller resigned after blowback from these comments.      trump campaign chair in ohio insists racism didnât exist before obama was elected      
__label__1 in case you have been living under a rock, we recently learned that hillary clinton is human through a series of reports about that one time she coughed and the time she got pneumonia. yes, somehow anytime clinton gets the sniffles, the right pounces on it, using anything and everything they can to push absolutely bonkers conspiracy theories about the former secretary of stateâs health (sheâs on her deathbed, donâtchaknow). during an interview with acbâs sarina fazan wednesday, the reporter asked clinton perhaps one of the dumbest f*cking questions she has been asked regarding her health: if she would undergo âneurocognitive testsâ to appease inflated, only-existing-on-trumpâs-side-of-the-aisle concerns about whether or not her presidency will be like a four-year-long edition of . hillaryâ just laughed in her face. âiâm very sorry i got pneumonia, iâm glad antibiotics took care of it, and thatâs behind us now,â the former secretary of state said, somehow managing to avoid knocking the reporter for starting off by claiming 9/11 was âlast week.â clinton explained that her health meets and exceeds the standards anyone else running for office has met, but fazan was all âso, ummmm, you gonna take those tests?â âthereâs no need for that,â clinton said firmly, surely wondering how the f*ck this woman got hired in the first place. âthe information is very clear.â  hillaryâ wasnât the only person laughing at fazan, who also beat the dead horse that is the email âscandal.â twitter lit up with people mocking the reporter for having the gall to waste time during an exclusive interview badgering the 2016 democratic nominee about her health: @hannahfc and you are reporting this nonsense as if it is legitimate. is this why you became a journalist? @danmericacnn @abcactionnews â (((david galiel:-))) (@davidgaliel) september 22, 2016  @women4trump @hannahfc @dmartosko @abcactionnews her career needs to die a hideous death â naked punditry (@nakedpundit) september 22, 2016  @hannahfc @abcactionnews oh jesus christ â chris (@hugetinymistake) september 22, 2016  @hannahfc @danmericacnn @abcactionnews no wonder media has an even higher negative rating than trump these days. what dumb question! â violetta argueta (@vva10967) september 22, 2016  @hannahfc @danmericacnn @abcactionnews wanna ask her if she covered up benghazi next? any other conspiracy theories yall wanna fan flames of â p. williamson (@pwilliamson2006) september 22, 2016  @hannahfc @albamonica @abcactionnews has this reporter asked trump if he'll undergo psychological tests? at least it's obvious he needs to. â peggy holtman (@holtmapa) september 22, 2016  @hannahfc @danmericacnn @abcactionnews sarina who (?) had the fuckingâ¦â¦you asked her what??? go back to school. find a new career. â (((bartnbeka))) (@bartnbeka) september 22, 2016  @sarinafazanwfts well at least people are talking about you for awhile even if it's for being a terrible journalist. enjoy it while it lasts â mattydean (@mattydean) september 22, 2016  as some pointed out to this simpleton, hillaryâ released her medical records just after the 9/11 anniversary, which was more than a week ago. she was diagnosed with a âmild, non-contagious bacterial pneumonia,â was given antibiotics, and had to practically be tied down to keep her from rushing back out on the campaign trail because she has traditionally insisted on being f*cking superwoman. whatâs next? gonna ask her about benghazi? maybe she knowsâ where obamaâsâ  birth certificate is hidden. could she have some inside information on a second gunman involved in the jfk assassination?       hillary literally laughs in the face of reporter who pushes insane health conspiracies (video)      
__label__1 were you worried that donald trump might fall victim to a âconcentrated satanic attack?â yeah? well, you arenât alone. but good news folks, you donât have to worry about that anymore! god himself is now protecting the gop nominee from the dark lord. on wednesday, trump attended the midwest vision and values pastors leadership conferenceâ in cleveland.â trump-loving black man who lost his damn mindâ pastor darrell scott was worried that satan might be after trump too, which is ironic since most of us assumed the republican nominee was workingâ  the prince of darkness already. scott claims thatâ before trump began is bid for the presidency, aâ ânationally knownâ preacherâ warned him âthat if you choose to run for president, thereâs going to be a concentrated satanic attack against you.â âhe said thereâs going to be a demon, principalities and powers, that are going to war against you on a level that youâve never seen before and iâm watching it every day,â scott said. scottâs wife, belinda scott, prayed over trump as those around him laid hands on the bigoted billionaire, making sure satan knew they were serious, dammit: âgod we ask you right now that your choice is this choice.â âgod, i ask that you would touch this man, donald j. trump,â she continued, âgive him the anointing to lead this nation.â because what would jesus do? well, duh! heâd make america great again. and naturally, he would use a racist demagogue to do it.

__label__1 the question of what the role of a moderator is in a presidential debate has taken on a whole new significance during this election because donald trump, more so than any candidate in american history, has shown a willingness to lie, boldly and without apology, when he feels it suits him. his ability to say, with a straight face, obvious lies that a typical human would find impossible due to a profound sense of shame make his appearance on the debate stage a singular moment in history. matt lauer recently held what was billed as the “preview” of the debates with a one-on-one sit down with both candidates for an extended question-and-answer session. while lauer grilled clinton on her voting record and on (*sigh*) the emails, when it came time to question trump he turned into a doormat. critics slammed the embarrassing way lauer allowed trump to lie to his face without any pushback. in one particularly blatant example, trump falsely claimed that he had been opposed to the iraq war from the very beginning, an easily debunked lie that lauer was surely aware of. the debates, many americans hoped, would be different. if trump chooses to openly lie to voters during the events, moderators should be expected to jump in and clarify the falsehoods. needless to say, the person making the most noise about this change of plans is…donald trump. in an interview with fox news, trump claimed there would be people “watching” for moderators to fact check him and would react badly if he wasn’t allowed to say whatever he wanted. first, trump slammed candy crawley, who famously corrected mitt romney during a debate with president obama. it has often been seen as a pivotal moment in that debate and the real-time fact check threw romney off of his game for the rest of the night. trump would prefer he and clinton get a chance to fight it out without interference, even if what he is saying are lies. you know, i think there’s a lot of pressure on [first debate moderator lester holt]. i think lester’s a very good person, a very good man. i think there’s a lot of pressure on him. you know, when i had the town hall, last week with hillary, i did well, and i had tough questions. but the polls all had her taking a drubbing….they went after matt lauer, and i’ve never seen anything like it….that’s what they’re doing with lester holt…and a lot of people are watching to see whether he succumbs to that pressure. the difference between trump’s camp and clinton’s couldn’t be more apparent here. while democrats are demanding the truth be the focal point of the night, conservatives – including trump himself – are telling moderators that they should not worry about what is a lie and what isn’t. as the washington post’s greg sergent noted: in other words, one side wants the moderators to hold the candidates accountable, and the other doesn’t. we can argue endlessly over whether those in the former camp are trying to game the debates so that trump faces tougher questioning than clinton does. but the bottom line is that, given that it is simply true that trump lies a lot more frequently, audaciously, and egregiously than clinton does, and that it took many months before this was widely acknowledged in the press, most clinton supporters would probably be just fine with equivalent treatment of both of their assertions at the debate, and if they aren’t, they should be. republicans want trump to lie. democrats simply want both sides to tell the truth. it’s rare in politics to find such a clear contrast. featured image via joe raedle/getty images  the mainstream media might have ignored bernie’s speech, but we’re not.      who saw it coming?: trump threatens debate moderators with retribution if they fact check him      
__label__1 fake fox news journalist sean hannity might be one of the golden boys at fox news channel, but he’s definitely going in the dog house after the stunt he pulled. along with a handful of rednecks and hicks, hannity and other conservative figures appeared in a ridiculously bad video called “#heartland4trump.” the right-wing video was released on trump’s official youtube page over the weekend. “one of the reasons i’m supporting donald trump this year is, number one, he’s gonna put originalists on the supreme court, people that believe in fidelity to the constitution, separation of powers, co-equal branches of government. he’s a guy who will vet refugees to keep americans safe,” he says in the ad. and proving once again that he’s an ill-informed hack who sucks up to anyone willing to pay him to spew their fact free crap, hannity offered full-throated support for trump’s luxurious border wall (not going to happen). “and of course he’s going to build that wall,” hannity continued. “he says he’s going to have mexico pay for it, that’s fine, as long as we secure the country. and of course, we don’t want people competing for jobs.” it seems hannity pissed off the higher-ups when he didn’t inform them that he was making a promotional video for the donald trump campaign. “we were not aware of sean hannity participating in a promotional video, and he will not be doing anything along these lines for the remainder of the election season,” fox told the daily beast when they found out. we always deride fox news for its ludicrous “fair and balanced” slogan, but never before have we seen propaganda quite like hannity’s participation in the trump campaign. even fox seems shocked by how obsessed their host is with trump. when fox is telling its pundits to cool it on the trump worship, you know it’s reached embarrassing levels. watch the ridiculous ad below: featured image via screen capture  someone gave us a visual for the ages. now if we could just fill it up with kitty litter. used kitty litter.      hannity goes rogue, secretly films gushing trump ad – and fox news is pissed

__label__1 as this bizarre election cycle heads into the home stretch, the issue of race relations in america has become almost all-consuming. add the shootings of two black men in tulsa and charlotte by police and the fuse to the powder keg is remarkably short. as the left contends that systemic institutional racism is alive and well in this country, the right fires back with abraham lincoln and martin luther king jr. quotes to prove that it’s not. while liberals decry the shooting of unarmed black men as evidence of the violence and oppression inherent in the system, conservatives write it off not as black men being killed but rather as “thugs” getting what they deserve for “non-compliance.” one of the favorite pastimes of the modern conservative is to forget the due process afforded to all americans under the constitution and instead convict them with their past records. forgetting that institutional racism extends into police departments and court systems, making young black men more susceptible to arrest and conviction, we know about every instance of driving without a license, resisting arrest and jaywalking ever perpetrated by every black man ever shot and killed by police. today, while looking through a twitter feed at a fox news report about tulsa officer betty shelby being charged with manslaughter for killing a man with his hands in the air, i came across a tweet that shows that racism is without a doubt alive and well in america: @foxandfriends@blp3pic.twitter.com/jmjd5dncra — theresa (@vote_trump_) september 23, 2016  once again, conservatives feel the need to point out that the police officer who killed a man shouldn’t be held accountable because he was a very, very bad person. there’s only one problem here: the tweeted information is about the man killed in charlotte, not terence crutcher, who was killed by the officer in question. my response was as simple as i could possibly make it: @vote_trump_ @foxandfriends @blp3 why is another man’s record relevant? oh…because “they” are all the same, right? — ezekiel wilekenmeyer (@wilekenmeyer) september 23, 2016  terence crutcher being judged on the criminal record of kieth lamont scott isn’t really that surprising, is it? what’s far less surprising is that nobody bothered to mention the mistake. that’s because my response was accurate. to the conservative racist, it makes no difference which black man was convicted of which crimes or that they were two different individuals separated by a dozen states who had never met. “they” are all the same. how fitting is it that her handle is “@vote_trump_” because…of course it is.            
__label__1 a member of donald trumpâs presidential campaign has creepy words about what could happen if her candidate becomes president of the united states. as part of a pbs special on the candidates, former contestant and current trump 2016 director of african-american outreach omarasa manigault said the key to the campaign was trumpâs desire to see his political enemies on their knees:  omarosa manigault, a contestant on âthe apprenticeâ who is director of african-american outreach for trumpâs campaign, explains what she sees as trumpâs motivations for running for president. among them: resentments. âevery critic, every detractor, will have to bow down to president trump,â she says. âitâs everyone whoâs ever doubted donald, whoever disagreed, whoever challenged him â it is the ultimate revenge to become the most powerful man in the universe.â in the video accompanying manigaultâs comments, the night of the 2011 white house correspondentâs association dinner is revisited, in which president obama infamously roasted donald trump, who was in attendance. the president, riffing on trumpâs promotion of the birther conspiracy theory, came at the reality tv star with his comedy guns blazing. obama heaped joke after joke on trump during the roast, and reports have indicated that trump was seething but sitting stone-faced during the monologue. some now believe that the episode embarrassed trump so completely that he decided then to run for president as revenge for the humiliation. regardless of whether that is true or not, history will record that as obama was crushing trumpâs spirit, he had already given the green light to the navyâs infamous seal team six to go into pakistan and capture or execute al qaeda leader osama bin laden. as the correspondentâs association audience laughed at obama making fun of trump, members of the u.s. navy were in the process of killing one of the most wanted men in world history. and obama never broke a sweat.       trump campaign official predicts the future: âbow down to president trumpâ (video)

__label__1 if you’ve spent much time on social media, you might notice that almost regardless of the subject, a string of anti-hillary memes seems to just automatically show up. that’s not a coincidence. it’s all part of a highly coordinated “shitposting” designed by billionaire and oculus founder, 24-year-old palmer luckey. luckey is best known as a boy genius who invented his version of virtual reality goggles, called the oculus rift. facebook bought luckey’s company in 2014 for $2 billion. forbes estimates that he’s worth about $700 million. the epicenter of his trolling seems to come from reddit, where he uses the pseudonym “nimblerichman.” luckey is a backer, likely the key backer of a pro-trump 501(c)(4) charitable “social welfare” organization that’s dedicated to backing trump. if you think that sounds seriously sketchy, you’d be right. according to the irs, a 501(c)(4) is not supposed to have politics as its primary activity, and any politicking it does is not tax exempt. published an expose on thursday, which says in part: nimble america says it’s dedicated to proving that “shitposting is powerful and meme magic is real,” according to the company’s introductory statement, and has taken credit for a billboard its founders say was posted outside of pittsburgh with a cartoonishly large image of clinton’s face alongside the words “too big to jail.” “we conquered reddit and drive narrative on social media, conquered the [mainstream media], now it’s time to get our most delicious memes in front of americans whether they like it or not,” a representative for the group wrote in an introductory post on reddit. people on reddit aren’t happy. in fact, the biggest pro-trump subreddit, r/the_donald, refused to believe that luckey was nimblerichman, but luckey insisted that he’s just the money behind the idea and well, he did it for a lark – because, you know, screwing with the future of the free world is fun! “i’ve got plenty of money,” luckey added. “money is not my issue. i thought it sounded like a real jolly good time.” he prides himself on putting out memes that are so bad that even the trump campaign wouldn’t promote them. before you think he’s a millennial who is still angry that bernie sanders didn’t win, think again. he has zero problems with money in politics. “the american revolution was funded by wealthy individuals,” nimblerichman wrote on saturday. luckey confirmed to the daily beast he penned the posts under his reddit pseudonym. “the same has been true of many movements for freedom in history. you can’t fight the american elite without serious firepower. they will outspend you and destroy you by any and all means.” luckey isn’t just spending money on anti-hillary memes. he’s spending money to support trump. as an early supporter of @oculus this makes me sick to my stomach. this is the org @palmerluckey is backing cc @techcrunch @uploadvr pic.twitter.com/athqtwol7e — cody brown (@codybrown) september 23, 2016  this is a message from @palmerluckey, the founder of @oculus. pic.twitter.com/cwlaa8ugmx — cody brown (@codybrown) september 23, 2016  luckey has apparently been banned from twitter, but that doesn’t mean that nimble america, along with the backing of white supremacist and breitbart propagandist, milo yiannopoulos. they plan on releasing more memes and purchasing billboards. it’s not clear if luckey has maintained any sort of relationship with facebook or if he has pull with the organization. let’s hope not. while 4chan, who is responsible for many of the anti-hillary paid trolls throughout social media, is also associated with r/the_donald, there’s no evidence, at this point, that luckey is behind financing that movement. stay tuned, though.       the king of anti-hillary trolling is a near billionaire whose company was bought by facebook      
__label__1 it’s no wonder trump is losing — and losing badly — with women. a new poll from mcclatchy-marist shows clinton leading trump by 24 points among registered female voters (58 percent to 34 percent), and 23 points among likely female voters. remember, mitt romney lost the female vote by 11 points, and john mccain by 13 points. while the trump campaign and his supporters scratch their heads as to why he’s performing so poorly with the demographic that makes up the majority of the country, the clinton campaign is reminding them why. a new (and brutal) ad has just been released from the clinton camp. asking voters if trump is “the president we want for our daughters?” the ad, titled mirrors, uses the donald’s deplorable, sexist, offensive and objectifying words against women from, “i’d look her right in that ugly face of hers,” to “a person who’s flat-chested is very hard for them to be a 10,” showcases women all across the country looking at themselves — their bodies, appearance — at their phones, wondering if they are worthy, as trump’s disgusting words echo off the screen. when talking about kim kardashian, trump thought it would be a good idea to talk about her famous asset: “does she have a good body? no. does she have a fat ass? absolutely.” so presidential. the most damning part comes at the end, when howard stern asks trump, “so you treat women with respect?” trump’s answer? “no, i can’t say that either.” this ad is so powerful. trump, who is well known to be a serial misogynist, sexist, and all around pig, should be ashamed of the way he regards women, their appearances, and livelihoods. no wonder his first wife cited ‘cruel and inhumane’ treatment as the grounds for their divorce, and called him a “chauvinist” on tv. little girls, and indeed little boys, are watching. their parents have a choice: do we elect a man who has a proven track record of demeaning women he doesn’t even know, or do we elect a woman who wants to tap everyone’s potential, no matter who they are or what they look like. watch the powerful ad that showcases just how much of a pig donald trump is:        clinton ad slams trump for his disgusting insults towards women and their bodies      
__label__1 donald trump thinks african-americans are worse off now than they have ever been, and president obama just took him to the woodshed for it. during a rally, trump declared that “african-american communities are absolutely in the worst shape than they’ve ever been in before.” the assertion suggests that slavery was a picnic for black people and that jim crow was heaven on earth. but president obama set trump straight during an interview with good morning america at the smithsonian national museum of african american history and culture. “you know, i think even most 8-year-olds’ll tell you that whole slavery thing wasn’t very good for black people,” obama told robin roberts. “jim crow wasn’t very good for black people. what we have to do is use our history to propel us to make more progress in the future.” here’s the video via abc.  president obama also slammed those who think racism no longer exists in this country simply because he was elected to the presidency or because some black people make a lot of money. “it’s unrealistic to think that somehow that all just completely went away, because the civil rights act was passed or because oprah’s making a lot of money or because i was elected president. you know, that’s not how society works. and if you have hundreds of years of racial discrimination it’s likely that the vestiges of that discrimination linger on. and we should acknowledge that and own that.” as president obama said, donald trump could learn a lot from a visit to this museum. to think that black people had it easy as slaves is offensive and it’s almost as if trump thinks they would be better off going back to being slaves. so he’s definitely on a slippery slope, and while that may get his white supremacist supporters frothing at the mouth, it does nothing to help him get black people to vote for him.       watch: president obama hammers trump for claiming black people are worse off today      
__label__1 a racist georgia man went completely off the deep endâ when faced with road work on his way home, threatening the construction crew with a gun while shoutingâ racial slurs. construction worker nelson king said that on thursday morning they were working on a section of road inâ coweta county.â harold bishop was on his way home when he came upon the portion of the road that had been closed for construction. the 72-year-old man then proceeded to completely freak theâ f*ck out and began waving around a gun while shouting racial epithets at the crew. âhe pulled up on us and he was like, âget these n-word off the road, i live here, iâll kill you n-word,ââ king recalled. when bishop pulled out his gun for the second time, king decided to start recording the incident while another man working at the scene called 911. according to the coweta county sheriffâs office, bishop then left the scene but returned before police showed up. king said he decided to record the manâs threats so that he would have proof of what was happening. âif i can show proof that he pulled the gun out,â said king, âpolice will get him.â it was a good thing king had decided to make theâ video of bishop threatening them with his gun because when police showed up they saw him throw a beer out of the window and smelled alcohol on him, but they could not find the weapon. thatâs when king whipped out the proof. âi showed police the video and they seen the gun when he pointed it at us, they were like oh heâs got to go,â said king. bishop has been charged withâ charged with five counts of aggravated assault with a firearm, weapon pointing a gun at another, terroristic threats, dui, and probation violation. he is currently being held without bond and is due in court on september 22. watch more, here:        racist whacko threatens construction crew with gun: âget these n*****s off the roadâ (video)      
__label__1 weâve all seen the horrific photos of children who are victims of the syrian civil war. perhaps the most infamous is the one of the little boy sitting, covered in blood and dirt, barefoot, in the back of an ambulance. he is clearly in shock. it shows us just what that kind of war does to a society, to ordinary people, and children just like us, just like the kids in our own lives. via mirror.co.uk well, there is one person who is completely unmoved by these images: donald trump jr. the donaldâs mini me has long shown his lack of humanity. after all, he made a disgusting holocaust reference when trying to tear down the mediaâs coverage of hillary clinton, saying if the gop did what the democrats are doing, theyâd be âwarming up the gas chamber.â well, now, heâs gone into the gutter again, this time regarding syrian refugees. trump jr sent out the following tweet, comparing refugees to a bowl of skittles: this image says it all. let's end the politically correct agenda that doesn't put america first. #trump2016 pic.twitter.com/9fhwog7ssn â donald trump jr. (@donaldjtrumpjr) september 19, 2016  and as if this werenât bad enough, comparing human beings to a bowl of candy, this is actually a white supremacist meme. the skittles are a reference to white supremacist meme. changed from m&ms to skittles because of george zimmerman. https://t.co/86fswdft5o â laura seay (@texasinafrica) september 20, 2016  george zimmerman is, of course, the wannabe cop who got away with murdering trayvon martin, a black teen who was walking home from the store in florida with only a can of iced tea and a package of skittles. so, in other words, once again, trump jr. is openly courting white supremacists on his fatherâs behalf. skittles spokeswoman denise young said that her company, wrigley, which is the parent company that produces skittles, didnât believe trump jrâs image was âappropriate.â she went on to say: âskittles are candy. refugees are people. we donât feel itâs an appropriate analogy. we will respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing.â the trump campaign is so repugnant that even candy makers have to speak out. this meme is racist, disgusting, and is just another sign of what a morally bankrupt family the trumps are. do everything you can to keep them out of the white house, folks. vote blue.       trump jr. once again shows his lack of humanity with disgusting tweet about syrian refugees      
__label__1 while rock band u2âs bono has had a career of being politically outspoken, his priorities have generally been focused â primarily on improving living conditions in underdeveloped countries. heck, the liberal bono even found common ground with george w. bush. thereâs no common ground to be found with donald trump, though, who the u2 singer called âpotentially the worst idea that every happened to america.â in an interview with , bono gave credence to the idea of american exceptionalism, but he feels that trump destroys that. in fact, bono says, trump could âdestroyâ the very idea of america: âlook, america is like the best idea the world ever came up with,â bono, whose real name is paul david hewson, told âcbs this morningâ in an interview broadcast tuesday. âbut donald trump is potentially the worst idea that ever happened to america. potentially.â bono pointed to nations like ireland and great britain as great countries but suggested that america is different because itâs an idea, one that trump is âtrying to hijack.â âthat idea is bound up in justice and equality for all â equality and justice for all, you know,â he continued. âi think heâs hijacked the party. i think heâs trying to hijack the idea of america. and i think itâs bigger than all of us. i think itâs â itâs â this is really dangerous.â source: politico hereâs the video:  say what you want about the often controversial bono, but he has seen the world and heâs right. the idea of america, as a melting pot, as a place where with hard work, anyone can be a success, is not completely incompatible with donald trumpâs ideas. trump is a xenophobe. he and his supporters want to turn our nation into a solitary island. thatâs never been what our nation is about.       u2âs bono has brutal words for donald trump (video)      
__label__1 wouldnât it be nice if we could just kick bigots out of our country? well, thatâs exactly what happened when anti-gay arizona pastor stephen anderson stopped by botswanaâ for a visit and decided to preach hate. andersonâs roadâ  botswana was an eventful one, with the united kingdom banning him from so much as getting on a connecting flight in their country. this forced him to find a âroundaboutâ way to get to botswana, where he intended to spend quite some time preaching. but after he suggested that homosexuals be stoned to death in a radio interview, anderson learned that his hatred is not tolerated everywhere. âi have identified steven anderson as an undesirable person to travel to south africa,â home affairs minister malusi gigaba told the bbc. the countryâs constitution, unlike ours, prohibits hate speech against, among other things, the gay community (even though homosexual acts are illegal in botswana) â â and if youâve ever listened to anderson speak for five minutes straight, you know hate speech isâ kind of his âthing.â the government even tweeted to inform everyone he had been declared a âprohibited immigrantâ: pastor #stevenanderson, a #usa citizen has been declared a prohibited immigrant and as such is being deported from #botswana â botswana government (@bwgovernment) september 20, 2016  what prompted his removal was a radio interview in which he said homosexuals should be âstoned to death.â anderson also repeated his praise of the pulse nightclub shooter. while he says he doesnât advocate violence, the victims were âdisgusting homosexuals who the bible says are worthy of death, the bible says the government should put them to death, so why would i be sad if these horrible people died that the bible says should die anyway.â anderson told his interviewer, who pointed out that the bible supports slavery, that while he doesnât believe the bible condones slavery (it does), âif it did then yes i would condone itâ because âthe bible is always right and i am not smarter than god.â in the past, anderson has blamed the terrorist attacks in france earlier this year on the countryâs acceptance of âf*ggots,ââ has called the orlando massacre âgood newsâ because a bunch of âf*ggotsâ died (he later expanded on that by adding that âperfect christiansâ would âbatheâ in the blood of the slaughtered innocents while singing praise to god), has prayed for the death of president obama and asked god to rip out caitlyn jennerâs heartâ and even suggested executing every gay person in the world âto cure aids.â you can watch anderson getting snaggedâ by immigration officials below. if youâre anything like me, youâll play it on repeat and laugh.  you can see an interview with his camera guy here:        hateful arizona pastor deported from botswana after saying gays should be âstoned to deathâ (video)      
__label__1 donald trump, jr. seems to have taken over as his father’s campaign’s supervisor of offensive posts, particularly with some of his most recent tweets. one was of a bowl of skittles, and asked us the really asinine question of whether we’d eat those skittles if we knew three of them were poisoned, but not which ones. he’s (rightfully) caught an awful lot of flack for that, but he likely didn’t expect to catch it from the man who took that photo. he probably also didn’t expect the photographer to be who he is: a refugee living in the u.k. david kittos fled turkish occupation of cyprus in the 1970s and has been living in the u.k. ever since. he is (quite understandably) angry by trump jr.’s misappropriation of his image to promote a xenophobic, racist and anti-refugee policy: “this was not done with my permission, i don’t support his politics and i would never take his money to use it. in 1974, when i was six-years old, i was a refugee from the turkish occupation of cyprus so i would never approve the use of this image against refugees.” oops. that’s only a minor faux pas – oh wait. it’s a major embarrassment to use an image that originates with a refugee to speak out against refugees. kittos took the picture six years ago in his studio while he was experimenting with a specific type of flash. he’s not on twitter, but friends familiar with his work let him know of this unauthorized and offensive use of one of his photos, which does appear on flickr. just is up with this campaign acting like copyright only applies to other people? we digress. anyway. kittos’ photo was never intended for political use and he certainly would never release it or sell it for such usage. trump jr. and others, like the disgraceful former congresscritter joe walsh, don’t seem to care, though, as long as they can make their point that refugees are dangerous. wrigley, the makers of skittles candy, also upbraided trump jr. for his baloney: “skittles are candy. refugees are people. we don’t feel it is an appropriate analogy. we will respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing.” for his part, kittos isn’t sure if he’s going to pursue legal action. however, he did say: “i would like the trump campaign to delete the image, but they are probably not interested in what i have to say. i was thinking about getting lawyers involved but i don’t know if i have the patience. this isn’t about the money for me. they could have just bought a cheap image from a micro stock library. this is pure greed from them. i don’t think they care about my feelings. they should not be stealing an image full stop.” and they definitely need to learn how to source copyrighted work if they’re the so-called “law and order campaign” that they claim to be. but that’s beside the point. kittos is, himself, a refugee. it’s natural that he would feel especially upset by this use of his image. it also speaks to the insanely tone-deaf nature of the trump campaign. they don’t care about such trivia as long as their point is made.       trump jr. will absolutely hate who took the pic of that skittles bowl      
__label__1 another day, anotherâ trump controversy. while the media hyper-focuses on hillary clintonâs âpay-for-playâ scandal (that wasnât actually a scandal, just crappy reporting from the associated press), a report has found a major smoking gun regarding the trump foundation: donald trump spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaireâs for-profit businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents. totaling over $258,000 in foundation money, trump may have been involved in has violated laws against â what is known as âself-dealingâ (something trump is used to) which prohibits nonprofit leaders from using their charityâs money to benefit themselves or their private businesses. so not only has the trump foundation been found to have illegally contributed to politicians, it has been found to be engaging in self-dealing. and people think the clinton foundation is immoral? here are some of the examples: according to the : in those cases, tax experts said, trump was not allowed to simply keep these items and display them in a home or business. they had to be put to a charitable use. he did not use the paintings nor the helmet for charitable use, but rather personal use. which is, as tax experts and the laws say, is illegal. so turns out the only âcrookedâ one in this race is donald trump, and the only fraud isnât the clinton foundation, but the trump foundation. illegal contributions, illegal lawsuit payoffs, and personal gifts with other peopleâs money (for non charitable use). of course, the clinton campaign hit on the issue, saying trump is aâ âfraud who believes the rules donât apply to him, â and that âclearly the trump foundation is as much a charitable organization as trump university is an institute of higher education.â ouch. letâs see fox news and the trump camp try to spin this. simply put, trump needs to be forced to pay back all that he stole from donors and all that was used illegally. and if doesnât, he should be prosecuted for being the fraud he is.       trump used foundation donations to pay off and settle private lawsuits      
__label__1 scammer-turned reality show star-turned-republican presidential nominee donald trump chatted with fox news’s bill o’reilly last night and commenced to bash our military, as one does when running for the white house while trying to garner the patriotic™ conservative vote. while insulting president barack obama, donald also took shots at the military, calling troops the “gang that couldn’t shoot straight.” in just 15 seconds, donald said “win” or “winning” nine times in less than 15 seconds while offering no details  on how he would obtain these ‘wins.’ trump says "win" or "winning" nine times in less than 15 seconds to @oreillyfactor: pic.twitter.com/yds6v1jjhz — sopan deb (@sopandeb) september 20, 2016  “well, i know how to win. i know how to win. i have been winning. i do win. even in sports. i win,” donald told o’reilly. “and we don’t win. our country doesn’t win. we don’t win at trade. we don’t win. we can’t beat isis. can you imagine general douglas macarthur or general patton? can imagine they are spinning in their grave right now when they see the way we fight,” he continued. “we announce that we are sending certain people over here at a certain time. everything is political. it’s very, very sad. then we bomb the syrian troops. you saw that over the weekend. we bombed, i guess we killed more than 80 troops.” watch:  at that point, donald seemed concerned that russia would be upset with the u.s. even though they were consulted beforehand. and now russia is absolutely furious at us. but we bomb the wrong people. i mean, we are like the gang that couldn’t shoot straight. our country, with this leader, is the gang that couldn’t shoot straight. that’s what it is. the united stats made a tactical error and accidentally bombed a detachment of syrian government forces saturday after mistakenly believing them to be isis forces. “the united states has relayed our regret through the russian federation for the unintentional loss of life of syrian forces,” an obama administration official announced at the time, according to mediaite. however, the russians, who appear to really want a trump administration, criticized the bombings, even though again, they raised no objections when they were consulted before the incident took place. russian diplomats then floated a trump conspiracy theory, because of course: after the botched strike, russian diplomats floated a trump conspiracy theory that the obama administration is actively helping isis. in fact, wherever the islamic state abuts his enemies, assad has actively assisted them with his own air power, while putin has pursued a policy of allowing extremists to leave russia and join isis. donald offered no alternatives as to how he would prevent a botched bombing. he just says the word ‘win’ repeatedly and his supporters eat it up. so does vladimir putin, apparently. this man wants to get his little hands on the nuclear codes. let that sink in for a moment. shockingly, sean hannity, the patriot, has been strangely quiet since donald bashed our military. the rest of the media is probably waiting for hillary to cough. photo by sara d. davis via getty.

__label__1 all the excitement about the 2016 presidential election isnât limited to the u.s. alone. media from around the globe are covering this race, too. and just like u.s. media, so too is foreign press particularly keeping a watchful eye on â you guessed it â republican frontrunner donald trump. heâs been a hot topic in international articles, editorials and broadcasts, and which pertain to everything from his bizarre and xenophobic statements to the violence at his campaign events. one particularly effective way that foreign media have been able to express their opinions on the donald is through political cartoons. those editorials of art can capture a lot more public attention, and often with a lot more punch. like these 12 in particular (first collected byâ politico): by christo komarnitski  byâ petar pismestrovic ofâ kleine zeitung â   byâ micheal de adder of the halifax chronicle herald by paresh nath of the khaleej times this one isnât against trump alone, though. see what appears to be hillary clinton on the left? the cartoon insinuates that trump is in the race just to make sure clinton has an easy win in november. the phraseâ translates word-for-word to âtoward an eclipse of the moonâ â or âtoward a lunar eclipse.â it seems to refer toâ legends about lunar eclipsesâ (or âblood moonsâ) being bad luck, and how (at least) one culture would try to avoid that bad luck. in ancient mesopotamia, a lunar eclipse was believed to indicate seven demons were coming to earth to attack a king. in response, one commoner would falsely pose as the king â a body double who would take the harm in case the demons attacked. (and when the lunar eclipse was over, the pretend king would be killed.) in other words, then, this one implies that trump is in the race only as a pretend candidate who could get republican party nomination, but who will only fall to clinton in the general election. by bryan adcock of the independent  byâ emad hajjaj by dan murphy  â  by ramses morales  â  byâ joep bertrams  featured image clipped from political cartoon byâ bryan adcock of the independent (scotland), acquired from politico       how the rest of the world sees donald trump: 12 foreign political cartoons      
__label__1 trump currently has his hands full with the ongoing lawsuit against his company âtrump universityâ. â now, a federal judge, the same one trump insulted during a recent rally, has ordered that trump university documents be released. trumpâs attorneys tried to avoid this outcome by claiming that the documents they were requesting included important trade secrets. â but that didnât stop judge gonzalo curiel. the result of this decision could certainly be damaging for the trump campaign. â while trump can brush many things off his back for some unknown reason, the idea of a fraud university that tricked college-aged students and put them into debt is rather disturbing. furthermore, judge curiel stated that part of the reason he wanted the documents released is the public interest in trumpâs case. itâs clear that trump has felt threatened by this whole ordeal. â for 12 whole minutes of a 58 minute speech, trump insulted this judge and claimed he wasnât playing fair. â citing the fact that this judge was appointed by president obama, and that he has made rulings against trump, trump claims he is biased. he also indirectly insinuated that the judge is biased because he is âmexicanâ (which actually isnât true at all, even if that mattered â heâs from the us). trump university was started in 2004 as a firm to offer courses and workshops in entrepreneurship. â the university used the trump brand and marketed it as an opportunity to be a apprentice of trump himself. â trump became a 93% owner of the enterprise and has benefitted from its profits. the problem is that many students believe they have not benefitted from the instruction. â the university is not accredited, you canât earn a degree, and yet thousands of students took out tens of thousands of dollars worth of loans to attend. â several lawsuits were placed against the âuniversityâ by its students. the state of new york even placed their complaints against trump university. â the state filed a $40 million lawsuit saying the school gave âfalse promisesâ. â the new york state board of education claimed it was âmisleading and even illegalâ to call the firm a university. as a result, the name changed to the trump entrepreneur initiative in 2010. â around 80,000 people have been documented as attending free introductory seminars, while 9000 paid $1,500 for three-day seminars. â all of that doesnât sound too bad, but take into account that 800 people paid around $35,000 for larger packages such as mentorship programs. in the lawsuit by the state of new york, under new york attorney general eric schneiderman, it was alleged that trump defrauded over 5,000 individuals. in a script only trump could use, he claimed in marketing videos for the school that: âwe are going to have professors and adjust professors that are absolutely terrificâ¦and these are all people who are going to be handpicked by me.â michael sexton, one of the top executives of the institution, said himself that ânone of the professors at the live eventsâ were actually picked by trump. the story and lawsuit of trump university may just be one of the most symbolic things about the trump candidacy and the man himself. â he uses his name recognition and the perception of wealth and success to further his interests. â itâs essentially âiâm rich because iâm rich, now give me more money/power because iâm richâ. by tagging his name along with the name of an unaccredited educational institution, thousands of people were duped into believing it would be worth their money. if trump university had been named the trump entrepreneur initiative all along, perhaps the allegations would seem more hollow. â after all, people pay for overpriced seminars and workshops all the time. however, naming the institution âtrump universityâ gives it the illusion that it is the kind of place a student could come to get a degree in lieu of another college. â that is just simply not the case. in the end, this lawsuit could end in trump losing tens of millions of dollars, along with tens of millions of votes. â thatâs a huge chunk of his fortune given that, depending on who listen to, some analysts estimate he is only worth between 20-70 million in terms of cash, assets and bonds. he himself claims he is worth several billion, but the truth is probably somewhere in-between.      breaking: judge over trumpâs fraud case makes âdamagingâ ruling â could cost trump his fortune      
__label__1 in 2011, st. louis police officer jason stockley shot and killed anthony lamar smith, a drug suspect that he was trying to arrest. at the time, stockley claimed that he saw smith reaching for a gun, which is why he fired his. self-defense, thatâs all it ever is, isnât it? the problem isâ¦smith was unarmed and now thereâs not just evidence of that, but thereâs also evidence that stockley may have done worse than lie. there is a strong possibility that he planted the gun in smithâs car after murdering him to cover his own ass. smith did flee the scene of a possible drug deal and a high-speed chase ensued. stockley was carrying a personally-owned ak-47 that smith, in escaping, almost knocked out of his hands. stockley was not authorized to carry that weapon while on duty, which goes a long way towards demonstrating stockley as an unethical officer at the very least. he was also recorded as saying that he was going to kill smith. stockleyâs partner, brian bianchi, said that he warned stockley about a revolver on the seat of smithâs car, and stockley himself said he feared smith was about to pull the revolver when he approached: âbefore striking me [with his car], i observed, in plain view in the subjectâs hand while resting on the passenger seat, a silver handgun. the handgun was pointing up and towards meâ¦ because of the presence of a weapon and because i felt my personal safety was in jeopardy, as was the safety of p.o. bianchi, and bystanders, i fired several shots at the subject.â itâs apparently hard to see in the videos whether stockley handled the revolver; however, itâs damned telling that only his dna was on the gun. something of smith would definitely have been there if heâd been handling the gun, as stockley alleged. the st. louis board of police commissioners did pay a $900,000 settlement to smithâs family in 2013, but stockley himself was not charged with murder. that is, until this year, when this new evidence came to light. stockley is now charged with first-degree murder, but is free on a $1 million bond. he left the st. louis police department in 2013. watch below for more background on this story:        damning new evidence shows cop who murdered unarmed st. louis man likely planted gun      
__label__1 protests have erupted in charlotte, north carolina after another african-american man was shot and killed by police on tuesday afternoon. the victim was reportedly disabled and was reading a book in his car when cops approached him. according to police reports, officers came acrossâ keith lamont scott while they were at his apartment complex to serve a warrant to someone else. police claim that scott had a gun and âposed an imminent deadly threat to the officers,ââ but family and witnesses dispute that claim. a woman identifying herself as the victimâs daughter, lyric scott, said that her father didnât have a gun, he had a book. âhe sits in the shade, reads his book, does his studies, and waits on his kid to get off the bus,â the woman said. âhe didnât have no gun. he wasnât messing with nobody. all they did, them âjumpout boys,â them undercover detectives, they jumped out their truck, they said, âhands up he got a gun, he got a gun, pow pow pow pow.â thatâs it.â you can see her video below: hereâs the manâs sister. she says he did not have a gun. @cmpd says he did. @wbtv_news pic.twitter.com/jwhmixy9m7 â sarah-blake morgan (@sarahblakewbtv) september 20, 2016 protesters poured onto the streets of charlotte on tuesday night, chanting âblack lives matterâ and âhands up donât shoot.â police turned out in riot gear and have deployed tear gas to control the crowds. meanwhile, the number of protesters continues to grow. you can watch video of the protests below:        protests erupt in charlotte after cops kill disabled black man who was reading a book in his car      
__label__1 donald trump has again made a huge mistake while referring to life experienced by many black americans every day. the screw-up in question came as trump seriously argued that the lives of blacks today are worse than they were during slavery and in the jim crow segregation era.  speaking at a rally in kenansville, north carolina, trump again stumbled in an apparent attempt to endear himself to black voters. âweâre going to make our country safe again. weâre going to rebuild our inner cities because our african-american communities are absolutely in the worst shape that theyâve ever been in before,â he said. âever, ever, ever.â the comment, made in a city named for a slave owner, is objectively untrue, and completely ignores that black people were once subjected to slavery and jim crow laws. while the media has largely viewed trumpâs weird racial comments as a sign that he is âreaching outâ to black voters, polls have actually shown that he is poised to do worse with that group than mitt romney or john mccain. black voters have had an inherent distrust of trump, which has been amplified thanks to his promotion of the racist âbirtherâ conspiracy there for years.trump also called for the death penalty for the central park 5, long after it had been proven that the young black men involved with the case had been proven innocent. lately, trump has argued that the black community in america is a desperate, infantile mess, relying on government welfare in order to simply get by. the image trump has been spreading has not been for black audiences, but instead have been targeted to a conservative base, high on the idea that ethnic minorities always have their hands out. black voters have found trumpâs description of them insulting, particularly coming as the community has made huge strides forward.       trump says blacks are in worse shape than during slavery (video)      
__label__1 months ago, former first lady laura bush shocked americans when she said sheâd rather vote for democratic candidate hillary clinton than a republican this election. for the most part, former presidential candidate jeb bush and former presidents george w. bush and george h.w. bush have optedâ to stay out of this election â until now. word of george h.w. bushâs decision to snub the gop by not voting for its disastrous republican nominee just recently broke, and itâs a super provocative move because not only is bush refusing to support his party, but he is voting for the democratic party instead. itâs a controversial decision, but obviously bush recognizes that itâs the smartest choice for the future of this country. the trump campaign, as you can imagine, isnât taking this lightly. in an interview with cnnâs erin burnett, trump campaign manager kellyanne conway reacted to the elder bushâs voting decision and couldnât have demonstrated any better how immature and bitter the campaign was about it. conway said that although she ârespectsâ bushâs choice, itâs ironic that heâs voting forâ âthe wife of the man who knocked him out of the raceâ in 1992. conway alsoâ chalked up bushâs decision to vote for clinton to his emotions and âhurt feelingsâ over his sonâs loss to trump in the primaries. she said: âthis was a bruising primary, and jeb bush really failed all expectationsâ¦ i know there are a lot of hurt feelings there.â you can watch the interview below: âjeb bush really failedâ¦there are a lot of hurt feelingsâ @kellyannepolls on bush 41 voting #clinton https://t.co/iyhilrgrpl â outfrontcnn (@outfrontcnn) september 20, 2016  this response from the trump campaign is exactly what weâd expect it to be. the bush familyâ is making a responsible, informed decision during this election, and that is way too much for trump and his minions to wrap their feeble minds around. this election is no joke â itâs about far more than republican and democrat parties. itâs about saving the country from a candidate that will destroy it â and the bushâs are smart enough to recognize that.       trump campaign gives pathetic reason why george h.w. bush is voting for hillary (video)

__label__1 even though donald trump (sort of) dropped the âbirtherâ issue, thereâs one pro-trump surrogate who â in the tightest re-election fight of his life â is still pledging to continue his investigation into president obamaâs birth certificate. sheriff joe arpaio, who was recently recommended for criminal court due to the continuation of racial profiling and perjury, told a group of tea party activists that he is certain barack obamaâs birth certificate is forged and will do everything he can to prove it: âiâm not going to give up, and weâre looking into it. i donât know how itâs going to turn out.â i donât care where heâs from.â we are looking at a forged document.â period.â i had nothing to do with trump on the birth certificate. we did it on our own, because of you guys.â the room of 200 or so activists were of course energized by arpaioâs pledge to unleash the âtruth.â before speaking to the crowd, arpaio told reporters that it was the tea party activists in maricopa county that got him âstuckâ with the birther issue after world net daily, a right-wing publication known for conspiracy theories, had a reporter speak to another group, and subsequently gathered almost 250 signatures demanding arpaio investigate. he complied, launching his investigation last week. according to arizona central: mike zullo, the lead investigator on the case andâ commander of arpaioâs cold case posse, told the crowd that he knew trumpâs statement was a âpunch in the gut, because it was unexpected.ââ zullo said he thought trumpâs statement was âstrategic.ââ âitâs not going to deter us,â zullo said. âitâs not going to stop us. i am closer than ever.â zullo also claims that a nurse who worked at the hospital where president obama was born, theâ kapiolani medical center for women and children in honolulu, denies that such a birth ever happened. well there you have it. not only are maricopa county residents footing the bill for arpaioâs legal woes (yet again), they are now paying for another âinvestigationâ into president obamaâs birth certificate. is this what republicans mean by âfiscal responsibility?â in maricopa county, there are almost 4.2 million taxpaying citizens. and now they are paying their sheriffâs office their tax dollars to âinvestigateâ some fringe conspiracy supported by 250 activists. think about that. maybe thatâs why arpaio is losing his re-election bid to a democrat, paul penzone, and it might also explain why his poll numbers are plummeting. good thing heâs focusing on the issues that matter.       facing tough re-election, sheriff joe says heâs still investigating obamaâs birth certificate      
__label__1 as we know, the final united nations general assembly of president obama’s presidency is occurring in new york city this week. that gave diplomats from around the world to weigh in on this year’s very strange presidential election. many seem rather rattled about the idea of a donald trump presidency, while others merely poked fun at trump’s buffoonery. one diplomat mocked trump, saying, “he’s a clown.” another said, “he’s nuts.” yet another said that trump is an “untrustworthy egomaniacal equivocator.” well, it’s too bad so many american citizens can’t see these traits in trump. an ipsos poll that polled foreign ambassadors who are currently working in america has 60 percent of these people saying they would vote for democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton if they were citizens, while only 7 percent would hop on the trump train. that in and of itself is very telling. dennis jett, who spent much of his career being a diplomat himself and now works for pennsylvania state university school of international affairs, says that trump’s behavior has “made many diplomats nervous and worried about american leadership, america’s role in the world.” also curious is the fact that the american people have succumbed to the belief that hillary is untrustworthy, while 93 percent of those surveyed in the ipsos poll say that they find hillary to be “somewhat” or “very much” in the realm of someone who they feel they can trust. on the other hand, just two in five of those surveyed say that they trust trump “a little” while the rest said they don’t trust him as far as they can throw him. german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says that trump is a “hate preacher” and alluded to the idea that the billionaire tycoon reminds him of demagogues from past times in his own homeland. french president françois hollande says that the gop nominee’s “excesses make you want to retch.” one lobbyist familiar with the diplomatic community says that there are deepening fears around the world regarding the idea of trump making it to the white house. speaking anonymously, the lobbyist said: “foreign clients are very concerned about what they perceive as a tipping point in this election. this is less about democrat versus republican, and more about open versus closed economy, vis-à-vis the rest of the world. with a wave of nationalism and protectionism sweeping the west, there is a real concern it will take hold in the united states and in what form it might show itself post-election. whether it’s immigration reform or trade policy, it feels as if much of the world is opening while the u.s. is teetering on closing.” even more alarming, the diplomats say, is trump’s “america first” and isolationist demagoguery. stephen walt, who works as a professor at the kennedy school of government at harvard university, says of the situation among diplomats: “first and most obviously, most foreign governments would like a relatively predictable post-november situation, and i think they regard trump correctly as a giant leap in the dark. whatever hillary clinton’s strengths or weaknesses might be, she has been a very conventional politician, at least when it comes to foreign policy. therefore, people don’t anticipate any kind of radical turn if she’s elected.” of course, another source of more than a little concern is trump’s penchant for starting public feuds with longtime allies of the united states, as well as his public musings that he might not honor alliances such as the north atlantic treaty organization (nato) — which is the single most important military alliance that we have developed since the horrors of world war ii. in other words, the entire world is afraid of donald trump. why aren’t the american people able to see how dangerous this demagogue is? donald trump could single-handedly destroy the world with the power of the presidency.       foreign diplomats scared sh*tless over the idea of a president trump      
__label__1 itâs official. trumpâs supporters will vote for donald trump no matter what he does or what lies he tells, even if his tax returns reveal the truth. during his show on tuesday night, jimmy kimmel ran yet another âlie witness newsâ segment featuring trump supporters being asked questions based on the false story of him finally releasing his tax returns. the kimmel reporter on the street asked trump fans what they think now that the tax returns reveal that trump is close with putin, leases his wife melania, writes off gold-plated toilets as a business expense, and supports child molester jared fogle. as it turns out, every single trump supporter said they are still voting for the republican nominee no matter what, even if it is true that trump contributed to the legal defense fund of a convicted child molester. in fact, his supporters made excuses for trump in order to justify his actions. so when donald trump said that he could go out and shoot someone dead in broad daylight in the middle of fifth avenue and not lose any votes, he was right. because trumpâs supporters were not fazed by any of the claims presented to them. they were even okay with him lying on his returns by listing his occupation as a farmer. seriously. hereâs the video via youtube.  trumpâs supporters are truly deplorable people who just want to watch the world burn. it doesnât matter what he says or what he does or how much he embarrasses america, donald trumpâs supporter will vote for him no matter what. so the question is will the rest of us sit home on election day and let the lunatics win? or will we get our asses off the couch and make sure donald trump never sets a single toe inside the white house? because if his supporters donât mind him doing all of these despicable things, that means trump could basically do whatever he wants in office without political consequences and that would be disastrous for the nation.       watch: jimmy kimmel demonstrates that trump could support child rape and not lose any votes      
__label__1 this should come as no surprise to most of us, but trump supporter don king let the ân-wordâ slip out during a recent speech in an ohio church. itâs also unlikely that youâll be surprised at the fact that trump was sitting right behind him, smiling with glee when it happened. trump loved hearing the ân-wordâ (screenshot) cnn commentator angela ryeâ spoke about this terrible incident with a trump supporter, and the racism behind the trump campaign got even worse. when rye asked white trump surrogate joseph borelli to âplease tell me that you understandâ how offensive it was to use the ân-wordâ in 2016, she didnât quite get the answer she was hoping for. in fact, it was the exact opposite. the white panelist basically said that since rappers use the ân-wordâ, itâs fair game for don king and everyone else. borelli said: âhave you not listened to music where other african-americans use language far worse than this?â rye couldnât believe her ears, andâ gave borelli a chance to save himself as she begged, âplease donât do that to me. please donât do that to me, today.â and of course, the dense trump supporter didnât take the hint: âi am going to do it, though. you canât say that don king is saying a word that is now suddenly unacceptable. itâs not one that i would use, but itâs perhaps a word that don king would use.â thatâs when rye went off and tore him a new one. in making her point, rye warned, âwhat iâm saying to you,â is this trivializes your candidateâs black outreach.â you can watch rye shred borelli below: @corporatebarbie@metroadlib rt @keithboykin: .@angela_rye for the win! #donkingpic.twitter.com/otd8owrcu7 â thanks for asking (@ykesha2001) september 21, 2016 rye also didnât hesitate to point out the fact that trump was smirking during the ân-wordâ-heavy speech, which will undoubtedly create more trust issues with african american voters: .@angela_rye on trump surrogate using the n word during a minority outreach event https://t.co/fvy4guzmzu â eugene scott (@eugene_scott) september 21, 2016        cnn commentator devastates trump supporter who thinks using the n-word is great (video)      
__label__1 world-renowned writer/director joss whedon has returned to social media with a vengeance and a message that needs to be heard by everyone. especially those who are apparently severely apathetic to the election this year. the director and creator knows all too well that we canât sit this election out and has recruited some of the biggest names in the entertainment industry to get his message out there. his save the day pac is described as such: âwe are a short-form digital productions company dedicated to the idea that voting is a necessary and heroic act. that every voice in this wonderfully diverse nation should, and must, be heard. that the only thing that can save democracy is the act that defines it. we are committed to fighting the apathy, cynicism, and honest confusion that keeps citizens from using their vote. and to reminding an increasingly out-of-touch and compromised set of representatives that they are answerable to the people they were hired to serve.â itâs clear in the video that donald trump must be defeated for the good of all humanity, so it makes absolute sense that whedon would use those who have played superheroes in his movies to get this very important message across. itâs absolutely important that we all vote, not only for president, but also for legislators all the way down to the local level. this election defines not only who will lead the nation, but also who will sit on the supreme court, and as whedonâs video points out, itâs a âtipping pointâ for the world. sitting at home because you think both parties are equally as bad isnât only wrong, itâs dangerousâ and allows that which we despise the most to gain power and control. go here to visit save the day pac, register to vote, and make sure your voice is heard. watch the video here:        âavengersâ director launches epic celebrity-filled superhero effort to defeat trump (video)      
__label__1 in an interview with a toledo, ohio news station, donald trump accidentally admitted that his âbigâ 20-second announcement that barack obama was born in the united states, âperiod,â was just a ruse. speaking toâ abc6/fox28, trump seems to have again picked up the birther ball in a âwink and nodâ fashion. âthis announcement earlier this week with you saying that you believe president obama was in fact born in the united states, after all the years where youâve expressed some doubt, what changed?â interviewer ben garbarek asked, prompting trump to explain that he caved because he didnât want to talk about it anymore â no other reason: âwell i just wanted to get on with, i wanted to get on with the campaign. a lot of people were asking me questions. we want to talk about jobs. we want to talk about the military. we want to talk about isis and get rid of isis. we want to talk about bringing jobs back to this area because youâve been decimated so we just wanted to get back on the subject of jobs, military, taking care of our vets, etc.â yes, being able to âget onâ with his campaign without being bothered by inconvenient questions about the five years he spent attempting to delegitimize the president by demanding his birth certificate, college transcripts and applications, and other documents he wasâ  would prove that barry soetoro (as the president is known in birther circles) is a kenyan-born conman who managed to install himself as president through what we can only assume isâ¦magic. sadly, this accidental admission that his views on the presidentâs birthplace and eligibility for office had not changed one iota is perhaps the most honest thing trump has said lately, with much of his attention being focused on defending the trump foundationâs misuse of charitable funds to pay the donaldâs personal legal fees, attacking african-american communities, and practically publicly masturbating over the recent attacks in new york and new jersey. watch the interview below:        watch: trump just accidentally admitted he still believes obama was born in kenya      
__label__1 senator mark kirk (r-il) has been caught red-handed lying about the details of his military service, and it isnât the first time he has done it. from the : cnn reported wednesday that kirkâs campaign website erroneously stated that he is âa veteran of the iraq war.â in reality, the senator stayed in the united states during the war as he served in the navy reserve. his campaign chalked it up to a staff error, saying that particular page on kirkâs website was not meant to be public and that staff members were making edits to it. staff moved the page behind a password-protected firewall after cnn investigated. kirk, who is up for re-election this year, has previously been caught in the middle of lies about his military career. he claimed in 2010 that he had been named âintelligence officer of the year,â when the award was for work his entire unit had done. he also promoted a story alleging that his reconnaissance plane had come under fire, but there was no record of that. kirk claimed that he had served in âcombatâ in kosovo, but he didnât. he claimed he had been deployed to afghanistan, but he had been sent there for training, not for combat service. he also previously falsely claimed to have been deployed to combat in operation desert storm. kirkâs lies about his service would be a major issue at any time, but they are even more notable because he is facing a strong challenge from rep. tammy duckworth (d-il). duckworth is an actual combat veteran who served in the iraq war. in that conflict, duckworth received a purple heart after her helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. she is a double amputee after her severe injuries forced the removal of her right leg near the hip and her left leg below the knee. in polling averages, duckworth is currently 7% ahead of kirk.       stolen valor: gop senator disgracefully lies, makes up military service      
__label__1 the season premiere of the hit television dramaâ features an amazing song performed byâ jussie smollett, who plays jamal on the show. the song, entitled âneed freedomâ has a very clear message: gun violence, senseless killings, and police brutality against people of color must stop, because our nation is ripping itself apart. smollett says of the decisions that inspired him to record âneed freedomâ: âi recorded this exactly seven days after philando castile was shot. between the shootings of castile, alton sterling, at the pulse in orlando and the police officers in dallas â not to mention the other numerous killings over the last couple of years â it was like we couldnât breathe. what are we doing as a people, a nation; what messages are we sending to the next generation. then this song came.â smollet is right, of course, and what better way to inspire people in an effort to draw peace in such a tense and violent time, where there is such anger, such division, such justified outrage, than by doing so in song? here are just a few of the more inspiring lyrics from smolletâs song: as i sit and think about all thatâs goinâ on my soul just cries out can you tell me please? tell me whoâs to blame for causing all this pain the oneâs we call to help us turn they kills us everyday see war is not the answer and love is what we need take the chains off, break the bondage set my people free we gotta make it better somethingâs gotta change the world needs your voice just to make it through the rain when i think of whatâs goinâ on in this world ohh it gets me to see my sister not breathe my sister, my brother here with me need freedom our world is cryinâ, no more silence, with guns and violence need freedom i canât keep dyinâ, weâre way too quiet, no more silence need freedom stop this evil, free my people, weâre all equal need freedom our world getâs brighter, keep on tryinâ, keep on fightinâ for freedom these lyrics come on this night, september 21, as, at this very moment, protests are erupting in charlotte, north carolina, because yet another black man, keith lamont scott, is dead at the hands of the police. already, as per usual, the police are in front of cameras, in damage control mode, spinning the story they want the public to hear. whether it is true matters not to them; they only want to cover their own asses, because black lives simply donât matter to them. this message is one that is definitely needed. it is, of course, a message that will likely fall on deaf ears. we live in a nation where people think that the right of every person to have as many guns as they like, anytime they like, no matter what, should supercede the rights of innocent people to live. these are the same people who think that cops can do no wrong, and that the bloodshed at their hands is always justified. these are same people who believe that freedom only applies to certain people, and to hell with everyone else. theyâre the people who think that every black man shot by police was just another âthugâ anyway, and that the void left in the lives of his loved ones is of no importance. theyâre the same people who donât care about what happened in orlando, or oregon, or newtown, or any of the other countless places where people who should have never had firearms carried out massacres. they only care about their guns and their rigid belief that whatever happened was worth their version of âfreedom.â hopefully, the people who need to hear this message the most will, and the killing will stop. however, i sadly wonât be able to hold my breath on that one. it will only continue another day, in another city after another innocent life is lost, or another unbelievably tragic and preventable massacre is carried out. sadly, that is the america we live in today. watch the video below:        âempireâ takes on racist police violence, guns in america in breathtaking new song (video)      
__label__1 for decades, employers have been holding america hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we donât vote the way they want. of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced. it hasnât been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that weâve seen a ceo be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (republican) loses. four years ago, it was âpapaâ john schnatter, who threatened to cut his employeesâ hours and raise the price of pizzas if obamacare went through. it did and he didnât. this year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesnât get his way. andy puzder is the ceo of carlâs jr. and hardeeâs. hereâs one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:  judging by the commercials, like donald trump, puzder likely cares little about political correctness. but thatâs not the reason he wants a republican in office. he just doesnât want to pay people more, or at all. in an op-ed in the wall street journal, puzder says that if a democrat wins, either democrat, he will fully automate his stores. speaking about an automated fast food system named eatsa, puzder wrote: âi want to try it,â ceo andy puzder told business insider of his automated restaurant plans. âwe could have a restaurant thatâs focused on all-natural products and is much like an eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.â âwith government driving up the cost of labor, itâs driving down the number of jobs,â he says. âyouâre going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.â âthis is the problem with bernie sanders, and hillary clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,â says puzder. âdoes it really help if sally makes $3 more an hour if suzie has no job?â source: yahoo finance this threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. across the country, puzder has about 20,000 employees. heâs hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests. puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. one has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is. puzder is doing just fine. in 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. his profits have been up in recent years, but his employees donât see any of that. in fact, puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied. you can guarantee, though, that even if a republican wins the white house and the minimum wage stays the same, puzder will still be automating. thatâs just the way he is: profits over people.      fast food ceo threatens to fire everyone if a democrat wins the presidency      
__label__1 police protected and served the hell out of a teen girl in hagerstown, md. in a chilling incident that took place on sunday. the 15-year-old biracial girl was riding her bike when she was hit by a car. she laid unconscious on the pavement for about 30 seconds and when she came to, she checked herself for injuries and decided to ride her bike home. witnesses urged her to wait for the ambulance and police to show up, but the girl said she was fine and wanted to leave the scene. that’s when the police showed up and the situation went from bad to worse. in a facebook video posted online, an onlooker caught the police manhandling the girl, slamming her into a wall, handcuffing her, shoving her into the back of a police car then pepper-spraying her in the face. for being hit by a car and trying to leave the girl was slapped with disorderly conduct, two counts of second-degree assault, possession of marijuana and failure to obey a traffic device. an attorney for the girl named robin ficker recounted the incident: she was dazed, then she got up and realized she was ok.” ficker says when paramedics arrived the girl refused medical assistance and when she tried to ride away on her bike, police pulled the 5 foot 105 lbs girl off her bike. at this point, ficker says the police lifted both her arms above her head and slammed her face first into a wall, adding: her face hit the windowsill.” ficker said at this point his client became terrified and struggled with police as they shoved her into the back of a police car. she refused to pull her feet into the car. that’s when the video begins. the cop warns her to pull her feet in or she’ll get pepper sprayed. in the video, the girl begs the white officers to call “zack” who was a black officer she was apparently familiar with. a bystander then intervenes and questions the police over why they are treating the girl so roughly, the officer responds: “what happens…when she’s like, ‘i’m fine,’ right, and has a brain injury or something like that, and then she could die later? and she’s going to come over here and fight us when all we want to do is make sure she’s ok.” at this point, the police close the door on the girl’s feet and through a cracked window gas the backseat with pepper spray while the girl screams that she can’t breathe. despite the police’s insistence, the girl had to be evaluated by a hospital for her injuries, rather than take her to the er or turn her over to the paramedics, they take her straight to the police station and booked her on multiple charges. it took three hours for the girl to be released from jail, where her father drove her straight to the hospital to get the burning chemicals flushed from her eyes. ficker says: the only treatment she got (from police) was slamming, abuse and mace.” the girl is an honor student and never had a run-in with the law until sunday. the hagerstown police say they are reviewing body cam footage of the incident, but found the girl to be at fault for the bicycle accident. featured image via facebook (screen capture)            
__label__1 donald trump is calling for one of the most controversial and racially charged policies enacted by police departments to be expanded across the entire country. the city of new york recently ended âstop and frisk,â but trump is pushing for it, apparently egged on by his top campaign surrogate, former new york city mayor rudy giuliani. from : in a pre-taped interview on fox news scheduled to air wednesday night, trump was asked by an audience member what he would do to address âviolence in the black communityâ and âblack-on-black crime.â trump responded by proposing that âstop-and-friskâ policing, in which an officer is empowered to stop an individual and frisk them for weapons or any other illegal contraband, be adopted nationwide. âi would do stop-and-frisk. i think you have to. we did it in new york, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically,â trump told the questioner. stop-and-frisk was repeatedly called out and protested against by new york city residents because the policy was shown time and time again to disproportionately target black and latino residents. they were singled out for examination and interrogation by police officers, in what some felt were quotas set up by police management. when the city stopped using stop-and-frisk, they did not see an increase in crime, despite claims from its supporters that there would be a spike in criminal activity. most people who had been subject to stop-and-frisk were let go, because they hadnât done anything wrong. former us district court judge shira scheindlin, who had ruled the procedure unconstitutional in federal court, described it as âdestructiveâ in an interview with buzzfeed. she added: âin short, the overstopping in many communities harmed the relationship between the people and the police. cooperation has now improved due to positive efforts by police to work with the community not against it.â       trump calls for this racist policy to be forced on every state      
__label__1 jimmy kimmel had an opportunity to bash donald trump in front of an audience of millions at the emmys and he did not disappoint. he even went after trump’s enablers who were sitting in the audience. kimmel opened the ceremony by poking fun of hollywood’s elite and making several sarcastic but pointed jokes about diversity. “this year’s nominees are the most diverse ever. and here in hollywood, the only thing we value more than diversity is congratulating ourselves on how much we value diversity. the emmys are so diverse this year, the oscars are telling people we’re one of their closest friends.” kimmel sarcastically riffed about the existence of television making it possible for such self-aggrandizing and bombastic egotists like trump to thrive. “if it weren’t for television, would donald trump be running for president? no. he would be at home right now quietly rubbing up against his wife malaria, while she pretends to be asleep.” and when it came to who was responsible for creating the five-alarm dumpster fire that is donald trump’s presidency, kimmel singled out mark burnett, the brainchild behind celebrity apprentice. “that’s right. that guy. mark burnett, the man who brought us ‘celebrity apprentice. thanks to mark burnett, we don’t have to watch reality shows anymore, because we’re living in one. thank you, mark.” perhaps only the guy who invented the infomercial is responsible for more suffering than mark burnett. that’s why kimmel nominated burnett to be the first one tossed over trump’s wall, should trump convince enough deplorables to vote against their economic self-interests. watch the segment below:   #emmys: @jimmykimmel blames mark burnett for donald trump during his opening monologue https://t.co/dxe9jeoinp pic.twitter.com/vz6gne5hnl — hollywood reporter (@thr) september 19, 2016  featured image via getty  leading republican candidate, ben carson, abandons the constitution and admits he wants to fully embrace fascism if elected president.      emmy host kimmel calls out dude who made trump a reality tv star for helping destroy america (video)      
__label__1 when donald trump talks about america, he often talks about how we don’t “win anymore.” we don’t win on manufacturing. we don’t win on trade. we don’t win on economics. we don’t win against isis. it’s that last point i wish to address, because trump said at a recent rally: “our military can’t beat isis. can you imagine the great general douglas macarthur or the great general george patton saying we can’t beat isis. patton would rip your heart out if you ever said that. we can’t beat – right? can you imagine that though? can you imagine what – they’re spinning right now. they’re watching. they’re spinning in their grave.” you, donnie trump, go on, and speak like macarthur and patton talk to you. you sound like you’ve assured them you can win here, and you’ll do them proud. is that how you see it, donnie? you’re ignoring an awful lot there, donnie. neither macarthur nor patton behaved the way you do. they were tacticians, not juggernauts who rolled to victory in every single engagement. they knew when to steamroll, and when to pull back and regroup. in your crusade against anything that even remotely looks like weakness, you’ve taught your dense and idiotic followers that winning against isis is as simple as a football game. simply act like we can win, and we’ll win. i’m sure that our dear mr. trump does not see anything wrong with talking this way. after all, nothing he ever does is wrong. period. end of. however, the problem is not how he sees it. the problem is the message he’s putting forth. he’s treating war, and terrorism, like they’re football games. if we just think positively, believe we can win, and stop acting like we can’t beat isis, we’ll beat them handily. that’s not true. generals patton and macarthur were so successful in part because they were realistic. there were massive failures during wwii. we did not ride in on this white horse to save the day. however, donnie disgustingly buys into that very narrative. we didn’t. macarthur was already in the philippines when japan attacked pearl harbor. in the ensuing months, he suffered grievous defeats. he actually ordered a withdrawal to australia to regroup. he was human. his troops were human. japan was a juggernaut at the time, and we couldn’t beat them with brute force. what do you think of that, donnie? macarthur actually a isn’t that giving up? isn’t that what you’re railing against? macarthur is remembered as great of things like this. not in spite of them, and definitely not because they didn’t happen. then there’s patton. he does seem to have been more the style that you see in your head. for instance, he’s reported to have said: “we shall attack and attack until we are exhausted, and then we shall attack again.” yet he was surrounded by controversy over his leadership methods. congress and the military actually demanded his removal from command after he slapped a soldier who was suffering from battle fatigue. there were other such incidents, too, but his qualifications are what kept him in the field. he might have stormed through battle zones like bastogne (do you even know which battle that was, donnie?), ending them, but he was far from perfect. donnie, all you do is talk about winning and losing, and yet, nobody has ever conceded defeat to isis. nobody in u.s. leadership has said, “we can’t beat isis.” not our president, not our current commanders. a coach telling his football team “we can’t do this,” hands the game to the other team. our military doesn’t operate like that, however. it never has. it operates with the understanding that there will be defeats. learning from those defeats is key to beating isis — something you would know if you weren’t such a conceited bastard. on the ground, unit commanders, all the way down to squad leaders, will give pep talks. yes, that is normal, and you and i both know it. however, those who are guiding the entire war have to be realistic, or they will end up losing it, and they know it. it’s not a football game. isis is not wwii, and it’s not a game, donnie. your treating it as such doesn’t just show astonishing arrogance, but it also shows that you’re wholly unqualified to be the commander in chief of the u.s. military. you will be able to understand how anything works as long as you keep treating everything as winning versus losing. as though it’s a goddamn football game. it’s not.       dear trump: isis is not a football game      
__label__1 donald trump is perhaps the most predictable person who’s ever run for president. if someone disses him, they are enemies for life, and if someone says something positive about the self-proclaimed (we won’t believe it unless he releases his tax returns) billionaire, brutal dictator or not, they will have trump’s loyalty and respect. now, things get a little weird when people are sarcastic, as is the case with a washington post article that, if you didn’t read it, might be something somewhat positive about the gop nominee. trump obviously didn’t read the article. he would have hated it, but he did retweet the article entitled “donald trump’s birther event is the greatest trick he’s ever pulled”: “donald trump’s birther event is the greatest trick he’s ever pulled”https://t.co/zvvqnxeiq9 — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) september 17, 2016  most of us, at least those of us who are capable of critical thought, would probably not assume that the article was a positive portrayal of trump’s birther farce, but, well, we’re talking about trump. as for the article, no, it was pretty brutal toward trump. here are a few snippets: donald trump is, at heart, a showman. he rose to national fame thanks to star turns on reality tv in which he played the tough-talking boss to a group of aspirants hoping to become as successful as he has been in business. his great gift is the ability to draw attention — and then use that attention for his own, usually commercial, purposes. trump might have read that far. he’s proud of being a showman and he’s pretty damned good at it, in much the same way that snake oil salesmen were good at their jobs. trump may have outdone himself on friday morning. he and his campaign touted a “major” announcement at his newly opened hotel in washington, d.c., at 10 a.m. the word was that trump would walk away from his past skepticism about president obama’s citizenship while also laying the blame for the birther movement at the feet of hillary clinton. (that, of course, isn’t true — according to numerous fact-checkers — but no matter: trump planned to say it anyway.) the article goes on to fact check some of trump’s many lies, especially in regard to the birther controversy. no, hillary clinton didn’t start it and yes, donald trump has long been a birther. the washington post then went on to describe the event, and it wasn’t flattering. this is how they described trump’s announcement: three sentences from trump himself — one that is totally false and two others that represent a total reversal from a position he held as recently as, well, thursday night. clearly, trump didn’t read the article, which is a little frightening. presidents are given several pages, if not hundreds, of important documents ever single day. it’s critical that our president read and not just assume and retweet.       trump retweets article that destroyed him, and he was too dumb to know it      
__label__1 donald trump jr. is quite possibly the dumbest person ever to take to social media. in the very least, it’s a tossup between him and little brother eric, who just yesterday made a fool of himself with his childish self-admiration for being the answer to a crossword puzzle question, along with free wifi, pushup bras and bozo the clown. together, the dimwitted duo provide enough social media fodder to make fun of them well into the next generation with posts to spare. when this election is finally over, it will be almost sad to see them fade back into oblivion. maybe we’ll keep track of their twitter accounts just for a giggle every now and then. today’s silliness begins with oompa loompa jr. pinning a tweet that is certainly relevant to a particularly volatile national discussion happening right now: colin kaepernick and the national anthem. as more and more athletes decide to take a knee in protest to support black lives matter, more and more conservatives trash them for it, calling them unpatriotic and demanding they stop getting media coverage. lord cheeto ii has been one of the most vocal, accusing kaepernick of disrespecting our troops and those who died for his freedom. for the left, it’s a simple matter of the 1st amendment. regardless of how you feel about the issue, these athletes have the right to express themselves. yes, that means from government oppression and prosecution and not public criticism, but let’s not forget that it’s people like little comb-over who are calling for police to stop providing protection for these athletes, for their employers to terminate their contracts and some have even gone so far as to suggest they be jailed for treason. for years, we’ve known that the only constitutional amendment conservatives care about is the second, so when this tweet appeared pinned to mini douche’s twitter account this morning, i couldn’t help but bust out in hysterical laughter:  clearly when you’re the son of pure evil you have a hard time understanding the words you use. when “liberals” — otherwise known as “sane people” — try to explain why people like kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are expressing that very right, we’re attacked in a frenzy of hate by people who think placing your hand over your heart and singing a song is mandatory patriotism. it’s not. the first amendment is exactly today what it was when the founders added it to the framework of a growing nation in 1789; the right to be you. the supreme court has sided with those “liberals” every time the issue of free speech is tied to something conservatives think should be compulsory, like the pledge of allegiance and school prayer. i’ve said it already once in this article and thousands of times in my everyday life and i’ll say it again: the 2nd amendment is the only one they see as absolute. all others are open to the interpretation of some holier than thou asshole like donald trump jr. featured image by gage skidmore            
__label__1 montel williams isnât afraid to express his absolute disgust and disdain for republican nominee donald trump â heâs made it perfectly clear in the past that he would never support or vote for him, and continuously speaks out against the business mogul. thatâs why there was nothing unusual about what williams did over the weekend, when the radio talk show host called out one of trumpâs biggest supporters â pastor mark burns. when williams saw burns complaining about the mediaâs hesitance to call the weekend explosions in new york city a terror attack, he couldnât just let it slide. twitter burns was merelyâ echoing what trump himself had said, when the gop presidential candidate jumped to conclusions and immediately called the explosion a âbombâ even before officials could investigate or confirm it. fed up with the baseless fear mongering the trump campaign has been become infamous for doing,â williams flat-out told burns heâd had âenough of your crap.â twitter little did burns know when he responded to williams, that heâd just started a twitter fight that he had no chance of winning: twitter williams was not going to back down, and as the day continued the men continued to take shots at each other, with williams continuously calling the trump-loving pastor out forâ falsifying details of his past and stating that burns wasâ ânot even a real pastor.â what resulted was a seemingly never-ending stream of back and forth tweets, in which burns was clearly on the losing side: twitter twitter twitter twitter twitter twitter twitter twitter twitter twitter twitter twitter williams had ripped burns a new one and exposed all of his flaws for all of social media to see. several hours later, williams ended his feud with burns on a high note, reminding his followers that burns had gotten himself into this mess: twitter twitter       montel williams destroys pro-trump pastor in insane twitter fight (tweets)      
__label__1 reince priebus openly threatened kasich and other republicans that they better blindly support donald trump or face the end of their careers. john kasich doesnât give a shit about priebusâ pathetic threats. on sunday, the gop chair suggested that republicans who donât fall in line behind trump could be severely punished in their endeavors to seek election or re-election. âthose people need to get on board,â priebus told : âand if theyâre thinking theyâre going to run again someday, i think that weâre going to evaluate the process â of the nomination process and i donât think itâs going to be that easy for them. in order to be on the ballot in south carolina, you actually have to pledge your support to the nominee, no matter who that person is. so whatâs the penalty for that? itâs not a threat, but thatâs just the question that we have a process in place.â kasich has repeatedly refused to endorse donald trump and did not take kindly to priebusâ threat, issuing a brutal response through his spokesman john weaver. âthankfully, there are still leaders in this country who put principles before politics. the idea of a greater purpose beyond oneself may be alien to political party bosses like reince priebus, but it is at the center of everything governor kasich doesâ¦the governor is traveling the nation supporting down ballot republicans and preventing a potential national wipeout from occurring on reinceâs watch.â weaver also added that priebus should be thanking kasich. so the next time john kasich seeks re-election or high office itâs going to be interesting to watch how priebus responds. will he follow through on his threat or will he do an about-face and all of a sudden support kasich? threatening someone with political ruin just because they donât support the terrible choice of nominee your party made sounds more like what dictators or fascists do. itâs definitely not the hallmark of a party that supposedly supports our democracy. because by trying to force republicans to vote a certain way, they are undermining democracy and all the values this country was founded upon. if anyone deserves political backlash, itâs reince priebus. he created a political atmosphere so toxic that they now have trump as their leader. the republicans standing against trump are the sane ones.       john kasich tells gop chair reince priebus to go f*ck himself      
__label__1 the city of flint, michigan is suffering through a horrible man-made disaster that could have been easily prevented if state republicans hadnât been so careless. after placing flint under state control, officials chose to save money by switching the cityâs drinking water from lake huron to the flint river, which has not been the drinking water source for decades because it was poisoned and considered unsafe for human consumption. as a result, the city has been devastated by lead poisoning, which will have terrible consequences for years to come for the children who ingested the tainted water. understandably, flint is mad as hell so they decided to take the state to court. but because michigan republicans and governor rick snyder are rats who hate democracy and justice, they shut down any potential lawsuit by stripping flint of the power to sue. according to the : though flint has not been under a state-appointed emergency manager since april 2015, the state still exerts partial control over the city through a five-member receivership transition advisory board, whose members are appointed by gov. rick snyder. the board moved quickly to change the rules under which flint is governed so that the city cannot file a lawsuit without first getting approval from that state-appointed board. this is absolutely outrageous. itâs like a woman having to get permission to file a lawsuit from the company whose ceo raped her. michigan republicans should not have the power to take away anyoneâs right to seek redress through the court system. it sounds like they are just scared that they will lose the case. and frankly, they should be. after all, it was their decisions that led to flint being poisoned with tainted water and the cover-up that followed. the city of flint absolutely should be able to sue the state in open court. but republicans took that power away from flint, and you can be damn sure that they would love to do that in every city across all fifty states if they have their way.       michigan republicans strip flint of their power to sue the state over poisoned water      
__label__1 there may be a few women out there who enjoy a man telling them to be more joyous in their presence, but as for the rest of us, thereâs nothing a woman hates more than being told to smile. do men smile all the time? no. because if they did, weâd think they were crazy and up to something. same goes for women. not every situation calls for a smile at all times. especially when discussing foreign policy and our military. so, when rnc chair reince priebus thought it appropriate to criticize hillary clinton for not smiling enough during the nbc forum hosted by matt lauer, it didnât exactly go over well. one person who definitely had a lot to say about priebus and his request of a smile from hillary was none other than chelsea handler on her hit netflix show . chelsea began by asking priebus: âwho the f*ck are you to tell someone to smile?â adding: âthis is just another example of how men feel the can belittle every woman in the world and order up a smile.â chelsea then said: âstop telling women to smile. we donât like that. itâs not an icebreaker, itâs a deal breaker.â going for priebusâ jugular, chelsea absolutelyâ destroys him and his ridiculously corny smile, then says: âyou know when women will smile? when hillary kicks that pneumoniaâ and trounces trump in november.â and thatâs exactly right. watch the full video here:        chelsea handler gets the last word after rnc chair attacks hillary for not smiling (video)      
__label__1 the hosts of were hoping a minnesota police chief would vilify the somali immigrants in his community and they promptly got their asses handed to them. on saturday, 22-year-old dahir a. adan went on a stabbing spree inside a minnesota mall. the somali community in st. cloud has roundly condemned the act of terrorism, but republican nominee donald trump spewed fear and hate in response during a phone call with fox and called the immigrants a âtrojan horseâ and a âcancer from withinâ that benefits isis. fox host steve doocy, who was named in gretchen carlsonâs sexual harassment lawsuit against the conservative network, asked st. cloud police chief william blair anderson if he agrees with trumpâs assessment of immigrants, clearly hoping that anderson would join in demonizing them. instead, anderson swatted doocy down like the pest he is and made it clear that there are bad apples in every group and that we should unite rather than divide and hate. âmy job is public safety. itâs not in immigration policy. i can tell you that the vast majority of all of our citizens, no matter their ethnicity, are fine, hard-working people, and now is not the time for us to be divisive. we already have a very cohesive community, and i expect that this will draw us even closer together. but at the end of the day, our job is public safety, period.â anderson then explained that law enforcement works well with all members of the community to protect the public the best they can. âwe actually work very well not just with our east african community, but all of our community. we meet regularly with any number of people, whether they are advocates for a specific ethnicity or different cause. itâs one of things that makes st. cloud a wonderful place to live, and i know that might sound corny, but itâs the truth. we have established and maintained a very good rapport with our east african community and our community at large.â doocy then tucked his tail between his legs and ended the interview because he didnât get the response he wanted. hereâs the video via  demonizing an entire community simply because of the actions of a few only ostracizes them and could cause more to radicalize. thatâs why we should reach out to these immigrants instead of hating them. fox news is irresponsibly pushing an âus versus themâ mentality that only creates a never-ending circle of hate and mistrust that hurts our country in the long-term. but letâs also remember that isis would not exist to recruit people in america in the first place had republicans not pursued an unnecessary war in iraq that created the power vacuum that allowed isis to rise. furthermore, despite their concerns and their whining, republicans still refuse to declare war on isis to give president obama the full resources of the united states to fight the terrorist organization. regardless, any group will have bad apples, even the white âchristiansâ fox news caters to. letâs not forget that timothy mcveigh committed the oklahoma city bombing in 1995 that killed 168 people while dylan roof gunned down nine black people inside a church in 2015. both acts of domestic terrorism were committed by white males who were born here in the united states. but fox news would rather freak out about a somali immigrant who used a knife in an attack in which no one was killed. if adan were white, not only would this not be referred to as an act of terror, it would have been a mere footnote in the news.       watch: fox news gets owned by police chief for demonizing immigrants in minnesota      
__label__1 i woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed: hereâs google:  naturally, my reaction was âoh, s**t, what did bill clinton do to damage his wifeâs campaign now?â of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. it plays right into the idea that the clinton foundation is all about pay to play, just like donald trump has been saying all along. unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people donât do, to find out the real story â and the real story is that there is no pay to play. âit was natural for people whoâve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. and i trusted the state department wouldnât do anything they shouldnât do,â clinton toldâ npr in an interview that aired monday morning.â  source: cnn in other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesnât mean theyâll get them. leaked emails have shown that some clinton foundation donors have gotten meetings with clinton and that others were turned down. there is zero evidence of pay to play. in other words, people might have asked for favors, but thereâs no evidence they got them. now, letâs talk about the foundation the media doesnât like to mention, the trump foundation. trump hasnât given to his own foundation since 2008. he does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. he also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money. new york attorney general eric schneiderman said in a september 13 cnn interview that his office is investigating trumpâs charitable foundation over concerns that it âengaged in some improprietyâ as related to new york charity laws. the investigation launched amid reports from the washington post that trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled othersâ contributions âto make them appear to have come from himâ although he âhasnât given to the foundation since 2008.â source: media matters media matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote trump at the cost of clintonâs candidacy: journalists have been criticized for the âdouble standardâ in the ways they cover trump and democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton. earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to clintonâs pneumonia diagnosis as the washington postâs reporting about the trump foundation. this week, both the trump foundation and trump organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of donald trumpâs dr. oz stunt. all of this biased coverage is hurting clinton and helping trump. trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor clinton âscandalâ (if you call getting sick a âscandalâ) while ignoring every scandal in trumpâs closet, and trust me, there are a lot.       proof the mainstream media is manipulating the election by taking bill clinton out of context      
__label__1 in a perfect democracy, there would be multiple viable parties to choose candidates from. each one would have to work hard and strive for our vote, and each one would have an equal chance at winning. unfortunately, because of the way election laws and funding are currently in the united states, weâre pretty much stuck with a two-party system and any third-party vote goes to help one of the two major parties. think ralph nader in 2000 and how his votes in florida gave us george w. bush. well, nader and the supreme court. itâs imperfect, but until laws are changed, it is what it is. no amount of whining or sitting elections out is going to change that. what we need are legislators willing to change the laws, but thatâs never going to happen if people keep having hissy fits. this yearâs election is so criticalâ not just for the nation, but the entire world. a donald trump presidency would be catastrophic on so many levels, both with domestic and foreign policy. reminding everyone how important this election is, and how a third-party vote will give us a president trump, is none other than the legendary writer/producer and creator of , seth macfarlane. macfarlane tweeted: âremember: this november you can help elect president donald trump just by voting for gary johnson or jill stein! happy election year!â remember: this november you can help elect president donald trump just by voting for gary johnson or jill stein! happy election year! â seth macfarlane (@sethmacfarlane) september 19, 2016  his sarcasm is more a terrifying wake-up call than just witty banter on the twitter machine. does this mean you shouldnât vote for stein or johnson? no, of course not. however, it needs to be brought to peopleâs attention that their vote for a third party isnât actually going to put their candidate into office, but rather have the possibility of ushering in the apocalypse with trump. a âconscience voteâ does not do anyone any good with a fascist in the white house, and it goes much deeper than just feeling good about yourself on election day. so, do what you do. thatâs your freedom to do so, but remember the unintended consequences of that vote and what will be in store for the entire world.       seth macfarlane just told johnson and stein supporters exactly what they need to hear (tweet)      
__label__1 donald trump appeared on â monday morning and blamed the weekend attacks in new jersey and new york city on refugees, a lack of profiling by law enforcement, and the first amendment. conservatives always go right past that first amendment and only abide by the second. trump took aim at refugees; however, bombing suspect ahmad khan rahami, 28, is a naturalized citizen. a fox & friends host asked trump what he would do to stop âpeople who are radicalized here.ââ trump responded to that by saying âfreedom of the pressâ was to blame. âtheyâre all talking about it so wonderfully because, you know, itâs called âfreedom of the press,â where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make these same bombs that i saw,â trump said. âthey tell you how to make bombs. we should arrest the people that do that because theyâre participating in crime. instead they say âoh no you canât do anything, thatâs freedom of expression.ââ âthe websites are the same thing, those people should be arrested. theyâre inciting violence, okay?â he continued. âtheyâre making violence possible. they should be arrested immediatelyâ¦yet we donât want to touch them because of freedom of speech.â watch at around the 21 minute mark: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gtrabasay8] however, incitement is already an exception to the first amendment. think progress reports: itâs a high bar to proveâââfor which trump may have reason to be personally grateful. under a laxer rule, itâs possible that trump could be charged for incitement himself. in august, his statement that âsecond amendment peopleâ could be able to do something about hillary clinton was met with widespread condemnation as a veiled assassination threat. on friday, he called for clintonâs bodyguards to âdisarm immediately,â adding âletâs see what happens to her.â donald has attacked freedom of the press many times. most recently, his campaign had a vice reporter arrested. the gop presidential nominee has gone as far as to defend vladimir putin for killing journalists. trump said of putin after being confronted by joe scarborough over the russian leaderâs bloody history with journalists, âheâs running his country, and at least heâs a leader. unlike what he have in this country.â freedom of the press is part of our constitution. itâs not up for debate, unless melania trump feels like suing bloggers for quoting from a source. but if you ask donald trump jr., heâll tell you that political correctness is to blame for terrorist attacks. ironically, juniorâs pinned tweet reads, âliberals love the first amendment until you say something they donât agree with.â he really should change that.       trump just blamed bombings on âfreedom of the pressâ (video)      
__label__1 hillary clinton was absolutely right to call trump supporters deplorable and this is why. in response to the expulsion of a kansas state university student who said it âfeels good to finally be a n*ggaâ in a photo of herself covered in lâorã©al facial cleansing mask, dell rapids, south dakota firefighter john nygaard literally called for bringing back slavery and endorsed republican nominee donald trump. âthink we should make slaves again,â nygaard wrote. âvote trump! fuck these people.â hereâs a screenshot of his comments via raw story.  while that probably made trump and his white supremacist supporters smile, the people of dell rapids were horrified by the remarks. âyouâre a public servant and youâre putting stuff like that on facebook, thatâs not good,â resident william dezee told ksfy. âthereâs enough problems going on, we donât need racial slurs or people wearing masks or saying something thatâs what 160 years old, leave it alone. thatâs the way it should be.â the outrage was enough for the dell rapids fire rescue to boot nygaard off the squad and he has been terminated. âjohn is no longer a member of our volunteer organization,â the department said in a statement posted on facebook. âdell rapids fire would like to apologize on behalf of our former member for his insensitive and narrow minded comments on facebook. this is something we take very seriously and this type of thinking will not be tolerated by our members.â hereâs the report via ksfy.   people like nygaard hurt the trust between the community and our first responders because you have to wonder if you are going to be helped or not depending on what color your skin is. a public service like fire rescue should work to help everyone regardless of race. but racists like nygaard undermine that principle. donald trump has objected to his supporters being called deplorable. well, if he really doesnât think a racist who supports re-enslaving black people is deplorable, he has zero chance of getting a black person to vote for him, and he certainly shouldnât get anyone elseâs vote either.       deplorable firefighter fired after calling for bringing back slavery in support of trump      
__label__1 nra board member, draft-dodger, pedophile, and all-around terrible person ted nugent has a message for those âembarrassingâ and âpatheticâ victims of a recent mass-stabbing at a minnesota mall â and itâs one that no decent person would even consider. on september 17,â an attacker apparently affiliated with isis stabbed nine people at a mall in st. cloud, minnetota. he was eventually fatally shot by an off-duty police officer. fortunately, the victimsâ injuries were not life-threatening â something most would celebrate, but nugent deigns it appropriate to simply attack the victims because they didnât bring their guns to a knife-attack. in one of his traditionally hateful facebook posts, nugent unleashed on the victims in exactly the manner one would expect from a man who assumed legal custody of a 17-year-old girl so he could have sex with her. calling the victims âsad soulless & embarrassing,â nugent mocked them for being âso patheticâ and âhelpless,â remarking that âapparently most americans like being victimsâ:  previously, nugent has attacked âlosersâ who donât carry guns after the mass shooting at umpqua community college in oregon last year, blaming them for being victims because they choose not to carry a security blanket firearm around. nugent falsely claimed that students were not allowed to carry guns on campus because of laws and regulations, but newsweek reported at the time that the campus wasâ  a âgun-free zoneâ and that it was âcommon knowledgeâ many students were armed. âdisarmed and helpless is an irresponsible, suicidal choice that will get you killed,â nugent disgustingly concluded. âdefend yourself.â victim-blaming is a hallmark of the right â something we can expect to see more and more of if donald trump is elected in november. get out there and do something about it.       nraâs ted nugent unleashes disgusting attack on âpatheticâ unarmed mass-stabbing victims (screenshots)      
__label__1 on monday, donald trump fulfilled his duty as a presidential candidate by praising law enforcement for catching ahmad khan rahami, who was responsible for the saturday bombing in new york city. twitter this would have normally been a nice gesture, if it hadnât been a contradiction of something trump had said just a few minutes before. fortunately, whenever trump flip-flops or lies, americans are able to instantly respond and call him out on his bullsh*t via social media â and they didnât hesitate to remind trump that just a few minutes before he congratulated law enforcement for rahamiâs capture, heâd dissed the nypd for allowing âpolitical correctnessâ to interfere with catching terrorists. among the first to point this out was msnbcâs christopher hayes, who tweeted: â  twitter â  hayes was referring to a disrespectful comment trump had made on â shortly before he congratulated the police officers, in which he said: âyou know, our police are amazing, our local police. they know who a lot of these people are, they are afraid to do anything about it, because they donât want to be accused of profiling, and they donât want to be accused of all sorts of things.â yup â trump had accused the nypd of being cowards and knowing who terrorists are, yet he has the nerve to congratulate them in almost the same time frame. other people recognized this epic fail as well, and blasted the republican nominee for being so untrustworthy and two-faced: twitter twitter twitter twitter this tweet was particularly funny, and iâm sure there will be some backlash for trump to deal with: twitter throughout his presidential campaign, trump has defended law enforcement far more fiercely than african american police brutality victims to help paint the picture that he is a âlaw and orderâ candidate. but thanks to his asinine comments about law enforcementâ having blood on their hands by assisting terrorists, trump has probably just ruined a year of pro-law enforcement campaigning.       trump gets annihilated on twitter after he pretends he didnât just trash police officers (tweets)      
__label__1 the whole world is talking about donald trump, over which he is no doubt preening because any attention is good attention as long as itâs focused entirely on him. but besides the obvious problems with this, thereâs one tradition thatâs very important among international leaders and diplomats. trump is getting dangerously close to destroying it. the tradition is this: you donât trash-talk a foreign countryâs political candidates. that might seem silly. it might seem trivial. itâs not. this is a very old tradition that was actually turned into policy at the 1961 vienna convention. while different countries interpret âthou shalt not interfere in foreign countriesâ electionsâ differently, most are careful to keep their mouths shut, at least publicly. even in 2004, when the whole world hated george w. bush for the fiasco that was iraq, foreign diplomats and leaders mostly kept quiet. not so now. trump is testing everyoneâs patience, and many find that they just canât keep it to themselves: âif you represent one of these countries that has been insulted or attacked, you tend to react. we are very passionate, and our blood is pretty hot. but we have to play it cool and understand that this is a campaign, and an election, and that we are diplomats.â this week, thousands of foreign diplomats are gathering in new york city for the u.n. general assembly. trump has insulted a great many of them in one way or another. what the latin-american diplomat said to is true around the world: âadding to the complications is that u.s. elections are increasingly followed intensely by people overseas, whether itâs via facebook or cnn international. so when a u.s. presidential candidate slams a foreign country as trump has so often (with mexico, japan, china, members of nato, and on and on) representatives of those countries feel unusual domestic pressure to respond.â wars of words could easily escalate into more serious wars with trump. heâs proven that with his threats against both ted cruz and john kasich for the 2018 midterms â he canât let a slight go. as another example of how he goes after everyone who pisses him off: heâs busy trash-talking a scottish whiskey company for daring to give an award to a neighbor of his who criticizes his golf course. in retaliation, heâs banned every brand of whiskey from william grant & sons for that affront, because really, how dare they? he should have more important things to worry about than petty personal slights, but theyâre actually the centerpiece of his whole existence. when foreign leaders wonât play ball his way, and go on record with nothing but what he thinks are insults, whatâs he going to do? two guesses what heâll do, but youâll only need one. he hasnât even been elected yet and foreign leaders and diplomats are openly attacking him. some of these people probably held their tongues when george w. was running for re-election, however hard that might have been. this would be hilarious if it wasnât so frightening.       trump is crushing an intâl tradition that even worldwide hatred of george w. couldnât dent      
__label__1 donald trump is, well, deplorable. heâs suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned ârapistsâ and âdrug dealersâ from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for muslims like hitler did with the jews, forcing said muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration campsâ as a âtemporary measure.â heâs even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad: âthe other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. they care about their lives, donât kid yourself. when they say they donât care about their lives, you have to take out their families.â but heâs not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, he also wants to bring that idea home. in a statement on the bombings in new york and new jersey over the weekend, the donaldâs senior communications advisor explained that trump is not fighting terrorism â heâs fighting the ânarrativesâ of barack obama and hillary clinton. and trumpâs ânarrativeâ is âkill them allâ: last weekendâs attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on u.s. soil on president obamaâs watch, should be a wakeup call for every american. it is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full u.s. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by president obama and hillary clinton. even worse, clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more americans at risk. the threat from radical islamic terrorism has only grown under obama and clinton, and isis has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. our enemies neither fear nor respect hillary clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. mr. trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike obama and clinton, he believes weâre in more than a fight about ânarrativesâ â these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens. pay attention to that last bit: âthey must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.â now, we already know that the problem according to the gop presidential nominee is âradical islamic terrorism,â and that trump has (numerous times) blamed muslims in general for any attacks he could. exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating âterrorists?â âtheyâre protecting each other, but theyâre really doing very bad damageâââthey have to open up to society and report the bad ones,â trump saidâ in march. âwhen they see trouble, they have to report it. they are absolutely not reporting it, and thatâs a big problem.â if muslims are âprotectingâ terrorists, are they not terrorists in trumpâs eyes? how many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows islam was rounded up? would there be mass exterminations? trump has already suggested slaughtering terroristsâ families. how would he define terrorism? these are all questions it is unlikely that mr. trump will answer for himself â but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponentsâ security to âsee what happensâ to them (shortly after suggesting that âsecond amendment peopleâ could deal with them. weâre dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the âlittle red buttonâ that launches our nuclear arsenal. itâs also important to remember that the attacks in new york and new jersey were committed by an american citizen â one with constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. this, of course, matters not to the donald. normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. but not with trump. heâs said it himself. many times. if we allow this alleged human, this oompa loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation â to assume office, it will not end well. be sure to vote in november if itâs the last thing you do. if trump wins, it may be.       trumpâs latest campaign promise may be his most horrible one yet      
__label__1 youâve got to love robert reich. the former secretary of labor under future first lady and former president bill clinton met a trump supporter at a coffee shop and couldnât resist stopping for a moment to ruin the poor guyâs week by introducing him to a concept that is foreign to him: facts. âi finally found a trump supporter â this morning when i went to buy coffee. (i noticed a trump bumper sticker on his car.),â reich writes in a facebook post that has gone viral since he posted it monday morning. then he completely dismantled trump â politely â before the guyâs very eyes: âhi,â i said. ânoticed your trump bumper sticker.â âyup,â he said, a bit defensively. âi hope you donât mind my asking, but iâm curious. why are you supporting him?â âi know heâs a little bit much,â said the trump supporter. âbut heâs a successful businessman. and we need a successful businessman as president.â âhow do you know heâs a successful businessman?â i asked. âbecause heâs made a fortune.â âhas he really?â i asked. âof course. forbes magazine says heâs worth four and a half billion.â âthat doesnât mean heâs been a success,â i said. âin my book it does,â said the trump supporter. âyou know, in 1976, when trump was just starting his career, he said he was worth about $200 million,â i said. âmost of that was from his father.â âthat just proves my point,â said the trump supporter. âhe turned that $200 million into four and a half billion. brilliant man.â âbut if he had just put that $200 million into an index fund and reinvested the dividends, heâd be worth twelve billion today,â i said. the trump supporter went silent. âand he got about $850 million in tax subsidies, just in new york alone,â i said. more silence. âheâs not a businessman,ââ reich concluded. âheâs a con man. âhope you enjoy your coffee.â while itâs unlikely that reich managed to change the trump fanâs mind â or even reach him on a level that matters â he surely left the guyâ steaming more than a freshly-brewed cup of go-go- juice. oh, to be a fly on the wall during that conversation!       robert reich just ruined a trump supporterâs week with facts      
__label__1 a reporter for vice news was arrested this weekend trying to get his press pass from the trump campaign. donald trump attacked new york times writer maureen dowd on twitter for a negative story â â a routine practice for the republican presidential nominee. heâs blacklisted reporters throughout the election and treated them so badly theyâve had to be escorted out of his rallies by secret service officers. he says he wants to âopen upâ libel laws, which would weaken journalistsâ ability to report hard-hitting stories. he sued websites for writing that his wife and theâ potential first lady was rumored to be a slovenian hooker. and monday, trump made a comment about the press that is arguably one of his worst yet. in an interview with âfox & friendsâ on fox news, trump was speaking about the latest terrorist attacks in new york and new jersey that occurred over the weekend. after blaming refugees, despite there being absolutely no evidence the refugee program is to blame, the hosts mentioned that people donât need to be radicalized in syria or iraqâ becauseâ they can simply go online to be indoctrinated by terrorist groups. trump turned his sites on a constitutionally protected right, the freedom of press and expression: âtheyâre all talking about it so wonderfully because, you know, itâs called âfreedom of the press,â where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make these same bombs that i saw.â trump then said he was totally in favor of freedom of the press, then turned right around and shat on freedom of the press saying they are âinciting violence.â âthey tell you how to make bombs. we should arrest the people that do that because theyâre participating in crime. instead, they say âoh no you canât do anything, thatâs freedom of expression.â â and trump also alluded to the fact that information on the internet should not be freely available (kind of like china): âthe websites are the same thing, those people should be arrested. theyâre inciting violence, okay? theyâre making violence possible. they should be arrested immediatelyâ¦yet we donât want to touch them because of freedom of speech.â incitement is not a constitutionally protected right, but itâs hard to prove that by making information available a website owner or writer is intentionally inciting a specific crime. but if the bar is lowered, trump himself could be arrested for incitement, after telling his supporters to take out protesters at his rallies, or his comment that âsecond amendment peopleâ could stop clinton. trumpâs problem with the media is troubling. using these latest attacks to go after constitutionally protected freedomsâ reeks of bush-era fear-mongering that led to the u.s. giving up privacy rights to the government. trump has left a long trail of breadcrumbs showing us heâs on a path to destroy the first amendment as we know it. freedom of expression and press is considered to be the fourth pillar of democracy in this country, without those freedoms the press is just a propaganda machine for the person in power. only a small man fears information. featured image via getty images/gustavo caballero      trump blames âfreedom of the pressâ for latest terrorist attack in bizarre rant on fox news (video)      
__label__1 milwaukee sheriff david a. clarke jr. has been a fixture on fox news in recent months, appearing on multiple programs on that network to attack the black lives matter movement, which he has compared several times to international terrorists. clarke has also been an outspoken supporter of republican presidential nominee donald trump, and is often one of the first names trump backers bring up when attempting to highlight support for the candidate among black voters. clarke spoke in support of trump at the republican national convention in cleveland this past summer. but while he was busy on the cable network attacking the black community, a man died in the jail under his command. he reportedly died of thirst, of all things. terrill thomas, 38, was found dead in a milwaukee county jail cell on april 24, nine days after being arrested in connection with a shooting. other inmates heard thomas beg for water in the days before he died, the journal sentinel reported in july. [â¦] last week the milwaukee county medical examiner announced that thomasâ death was due to profound dehydration, according to the journal sentinel. by labeling the death a homicide, the medical examiner indicated that it was caused by the actions of another person, although that judgment does not necessarily mean that anyone will be criminally prosecuted in the case. inmates at the jail say the water in thomasâ jail cell had been cut off for 6 days, and that one inmate warned jailers about the danger to the manâs life. attorney erik j. heipt told the site that he has received calls from other inmates to tell him that the water had been cut off to their cells, and another inmate died in 2011 when his water was cut off as well. clarke is reportedly part of a pro-trump bus tour arranged by a super pac that is supporting the candidate. the huffington post also reports that clarke took in over $150,000 in 2015 from âspeaking fees, travel reimbursements and gifts.â       inmate dead from alleged mistreatment in jail run by infamous pro-trump sheriff      
__label__1 while the media is focused on the horserace that will help determine politics for the next eight years, theyâre pretty much ignoring the fact that washington is still in business and republicans are busy being republicans, which is to say that the rich will be getting richer while everyone else will be getting poorer. ryan, whoâs not sure he can back donald trump, likely because trump dares say the things that republicans generally say behind closed doors, has released a new domestic plan, called, âa better way.â ryan calls it his antidote to anger and division. the only problem is that if anyone pays attention to the plan, they will be angry at how he divides americans into tax brackets, and as usual, the top tax brackets win. his plan includes a lot of republican staples, like more military, less regulation, repealing obamacare and deep cuts for poor people. in other words, same old cold-hearted ayn rand âi got mine, now f*** youâ gop themes. perhaps the worst part, though, is the tax plan. there are a lot of tax cuts (mostly at the cost to poor people) and nearly all of those â 99.6 percent â go to the top one percent. a typical republican tax cut will give about 40 percent of its tax cuts to the richest one percent. ryanâs plan, according to a new analysis by the tax policy center, will give three-quarters of its tax cuts to the richest one percent in the first year. and thatâs only because the cuts are slowly phased in. by 2025, the highest-earning one percent will enjoy 99.6 percent of the tax cuts. the remaining 0.4 percent will be divided up among the other 99 percent of the country. the new paul ryan tax cuts make the bush tax cuts look like socialism. source: ny magazine hereâs the video:  while ryan likes to separate himself from donald trump, his plan proves his policies are no less racist and classist than the worst trump can imagine. heâs just hoping we wonât notice.       paul ryanâs new economic plan is just gawd awful (video)      
__label__1 the pro-gun crowd loves guns first, and respect last. at least, that seems to be the case with whoever made a truly horrible meme out of an old black-and-white war photo. the photo depicts troops executing a couple of people in the back as they kneel in front of a mass grave. the troops âare just obeying orders,â and the dead in the mass grave are âcitizens obeying gun laws.â this is the meme:  we donât know who created this, but we donât have enough middle fingers to express how we feel about them. the piece of shit behind this is no doubt someone who believes the lie that, had the jewish citizens of germany and elsewhere just had guns, the holocaust wouldnât have happened. the photo in the meme is from the german-occupied soviet union, and depicts one of the mobile execution squads known as the. they were tasked with mass executions of jews, communists, and anyone else that the nazis decided werenât suitable to living their empire and master race. tens of thousands were murdered this way â they are part of the holocaust. the myth of guns and the holocaust is so completely and terribly wrong it defies description. yes, the nazis seized guns from their enemies, however, they actually didnât make much of a dent in total gun circulation in germany, contrary to what the gun-rights crowd wants us to believe. furthermore, the nazis actually loosened gun laws in 1938 for everyone except jews. people who have a basic understanding of nazi germany know that the nazis targeted more groups than jews, and they know that more people than jews opposed the nazis however quietly they had to. why didnât those people, who own guns, rise up? itâs because of the power of a police state â the very thing the âmoar gunzâ crowd fears the most. therefore, the cretin who came up with this meme can rightfully be termed as having no clue what they are talking about. but worse than that, that is just abominable, and has no place in any discourse at all. hereâs why: âthis historical second-guessing is deeply offensive to jews, holocaust survivors and those who valiantly fought against hitler during world war ii. it is, in fact, as many historians haveâ previously noted, a distortion of history itselfâ¦ â¦when you manipulate the history of the holocaust and use it to score political points, its wholly inappropriate and offensive. especially for the sake of the victims of the nazi onslaught and their memory, it must stop.â thatâs from jonathan greenblatt, the national director of the anti-defamation league. he was speaking against ben carsonâs painfully offensive assertion that the nazis had disarmed everyone so they could kill jews with impunity, but itâs just not true. and itâs an serious affront to every single victim of the nazis, as well as everyone who fought them. this memeâs creator ought to go back to the depths of the hellish abyss that first spat him out.       this sickening pro-gun meme is quite possibly the most vile thing on the internet (image)      
__label__1 donald trump has a reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests. he is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face, and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate. but lately, as trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel, he has also been in something of a retreat. that is, trump is only talking to fox news right now. trump is saying âyesâ to fox news almost every day but saying ânoâ to most other major networks and news organizations â a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. he called into âfox & friendsâ on monday morning, he is booked on âthe oâreilly factorâ monday night, and he has another town hall with sean hannity coming up on wednesday. rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for trump. if nothing else, it limits the candidateâs exposure to hard-hitting questions â while fueling frustration among journalists. at fox news, trump can avoid pesky follow-up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy, long after he claims to have dropped it. fox news hosts wonât ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right, rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement. at fox news, trump isnât challenged â and thatâs the way he wants it. the problem is, wrapping up in the fox news cocoon may feel good for the time being, but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort. trump isnât reaching out. it is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign, where instead of following the model of successful politicians like george w. bush and president obama by holding campaign rallies in âswingâ districts hoping to persuade voters, trump has rallies with the converted. on election day in 2012, fox news viewers were shocked to find the romney âlandslideâ the network had kept promoting was a harsh reality. they may be setting themselves up for a major failure.       how trump is hiding from the media like a total coward      
__label__1 if donald trump has his way, the constitutional right to due process will only belong to white racists. in the wake of the bombing in new york city over the weekend, police were able to apprehend a suspect named ahmad khan rahami after a shootout. rahami was hit and needed to be hospitalized to get his gunshot wound treated. and as an american citizen, he is also guaranteed the right to an attorney even if he cannot afford one. why? because the fifth and sixth amendments of the constitution say so. but republican nominee donald trump thinks the amendments should be scrapped in rahamiâs case. you know, because heâs a muslim. during a rally in florida on monday, trump whined because rahami is being treated in a hospital for his wound and further complained about him being represented by a competent defense attorney. ânow we will give him amazing hospitalization. he will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. he will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. and heâll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. and on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer. his case will go through the various court systems for years and in the end, people will forget and his punishment will not be what it once would have been. what a sad situation.â trump, who advocates for torture techniques, also demanded a speedy trial resulting in âharsh punishmentâ and suggested using âwhatever lawful methods are available to obtain information from the apprehended suspect to get information before itâs no longer timely.â hereâs the video via youtube.  the fifth amendment states: no person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand juryâ¦nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. rahami is innocent until proven guilty. so not letting him get the treatment he needs could lead to him dying from an infection or loss of blood, thus depriving him of life without due process. furthermore, the sixth amendment clearly gives everyone the right to an attorney, even a bombing suspect. in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense. the right to have an attorney is one of the most foundational values of the country, most exemplified by founding father john adams, who defended the british soldiers who were arrested after the boston massacre in 1770. in short, it doesnât matter who the suspect is or what they did, they have the right to due process and an attorney in this country. but donald trump apparently wants to put a âwhiteâs onlyâ sign on the constitution.       watch: donald trump says constitution should not give everyone the right to due process      
__label__1 the 2016 election is shaping up to be the weirdest (and nightmarish) election in decades. up is down, night is day, and stupid is smart. once donald trump became the nominee of a major party for the presidency, all existing and established norms went up in smoke. and the crazy is just getting started, so make sure you’ve got your passport handy. politico writes that former president george h.w. bush is completely snubbing donald trump and plans to vote for hillary clinton in november. this revelation came from kathleen hartington kennedy townsend, the former maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late robert f. kennedy. kennedy announced the news on facebook yesterday when she posted a picture  shaking hands next to bush sr with this caption: “the president told me he’s voting for hillary!!” this is actually not very shocking when you consider how much the bushes have shown their contempt for trump, after ruining their chances of continuing their political dynasty with low-energy jeb. neither george bush sr. or george w. bush showed up at the republican national convention in cleveland, and jeb bush has constantly let it be known that he has absolutely no intentions of voting for trump. so perhaps this can be viewed as more of a repudiation of trump than a glowing endorsement of hillary. former first lady laura bush dropped a major bombshell in april of this year when she essentially indicated that she was supporting hillary. here’s what laura bush about the presidential race: “i want our next president – whoever he or she might be – to be somebody who is interested in women in afghanistan and who will continue us policies… that we continue to do what we’re committed to do as a country,” she said, as she appeared on stage alongside her twin daughters jenna and barbara. “that’s who i want – or the kind of people that will do that and will pay attention to our history, and know what’s what’s happened before and know specifically how we can continue to do the good things that we do around the world.” say what you will about george w. bush–and there’s plenty–but his father was mostly a man of principle who put the country above petty politics. this is yet another reminder of how fractured the republican party has become. featured image via getty   republicans thought this would be a cake walk. boy were they wrong.      george bush sr. delivers ultimate taunt to trump by saying he will vote for hillary      
__label__1 it’s no secret that new jersey governor chris christie would like to be part of a trump administration, probably in the role of attorney general. but he may have to do it from prison if prosecutors are able to prove what they alleged in court today. the new york times reports that prosecutors in the “bridgegate” trial of former christie associates bridget anne kelly and bill baroni said during opening statements on monday morning that christie was aware of what was going on as it was happening. defense attorneys for kelly and baroni had also previously claimed that christie was aware of the supposed “traffic study” that was taking place at the fort lee, new jersey entrance to the george washington bridge, but this is the first time prosecutors have publicly agreed with them. prosecutors said that baroni and david wildstein, both alleged conspirators in the case, had bragged to christie about the chaos being created by the lane closings, and how they had created the bogus traffic study to mess with the mayor of fort lee, a democrat who had balked at endorsing christie’s re-election bid. but prosecutor vikas khanna, also told the jury that they should not wonder why “others” weren’t charged in the case. christie has denied knowing about what baroni and wildstein allegedly did until months later. but khanna told the jury that the governor was informed at a september 11 memorial service in 2013, three days after the lane closures started, while they were still going on: “the evidence will show that baroni and wildstein were so committed to their plan to punish mayor sokolich during those few minutes they had alone with the governor they bragged about the fact there were traffic problems in fort lee and mayor sokolich was not getting his calls returned.” wildstein, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in the case last year, is now the government’s star witness. attorneys for baroni and kelly described him as christie’s puppet. baroni’s attorney, michael baldassare, said, “when david wildstein spoke governor christie’s voice came out and everybody knew it.” there is still no evidence that christie knew or approved of the scheme ahead of time. but if prosecutors can prove that the governor did indeed know what was happening while it was still going on, and did nothing to stop it, it could cause serious problems for his barely concealed aspirations to be a member of trump’s cabinet. of course, with any luck there won’t be a trump cabinet for him to be a member of. featured image via andrew burton/getty images  trump told us exactly who he will favor as president.      prosecutors say chris christie knew about ‘bridgegate’ as it happened      
__label__1 guess who george h.w. bush is voting for? he lost to bill clinton in 1992, and his son is george w. bush. yet it seems that the elder bush finds trump so distasteful a candidate that heâs actually going to cast his vote for hillary clinton. according to bush sr. had originally planned on keeping quiet about this election. considering the fact that heâs a republican, and therefore expected to weigh in on the side of the republicansâ chosen candidate, this is actually pretty major. but it wasnât bush himself who revealed his vote. it was kathleen kennedy townsendâdaughter of the late robert kennedyâwho let this particular interesting tidbit slip: âon monday, townsend posted a picture on her facebook page shaking hands next to the former president and this caption: âthe president told me heâs voting for hillary!!'â she stood by that later on when talking to according to her, george h.w. bush would rather vote for his former rival and successorâs wife than the god-awful train wreck that is donald trump. a spokesman for the bush family refused to actually confirm this â he said that george h.w.âs vote is a private decision and will remain so. he himself isnât commenting, but it seems that those who are in his inner circle arenât being so tight-lipped, if kennedy is to be believed. bush sr. did make it clear back in may that he had absolutely zero intention of endorsing trump. thatâs a bold, but wise, move for any republican, since republicans are supposed to be on the side of freedom and trump is on the side of dictatorship and authoritarianism. his love of russian president vladimir putin would suggest that heâs also on the side of autocracy. none of these three things meshes with the democracy republicans say weâve built in even the smallest way. earlier in the summer, an administration official for george w. bush announced that she would vote for hillary, adding her name to an ever-growing list of republicans and conservatives who canât find it within themselves to support trump. jeb bush has said he can neither vote for hillary nor trump. a former republican president refusing to stand for the current republican nominee is a stinging blow indeed.       george h.w. bush may have just dealt an incredibly stinging blow to the trump train

__label__0 the bodies of 162 people had been pulled from the waters off the egyptian coast by friday, two days after a boat carrying hundreds of migrants capsized in the mediterranean while attempting to head to europe. dozens more are feared dead, said mohammed sultan, the governor of beheira, who provided the associated press with the latest figures. he also said that the search operation is still ongoing. many of them are believed to be children and women who were unable to swim away when the boat sank. wahdan el-sayyed, the spokesman of the nile delta province of beheira, told the associated press that the search operation was ongoing. an ap reporter near the nile delta city of rosetta saw between 20 to 30 bodies brought in by coast guards in gray inflatable boats and fishermen in wooden boats early friday morning and delivered to ambulances at the coast guard pier. pictures posted on social networking sites showed dozens of bodies lined up in black plastic bags, and others floating near wooden fishing boats. videos showed that some fishermen were using nets to bring up the bodies. in one video, a fisherman was heard shouting into his mobile phone that, "the sea is littered with bodies." many of those gathered at the shore where the bodies arrived appeared to be wearing surgical masks to protect them from the smell of decaying bodies. some brought chunks of ice to be placed on the bodies to prevent them from decomposing. authorities have struggled to give accurate figures for the number of people on board the capsized vessel. the u.n. refugee agency, unhcr, estimated that the boat was packed with some 450 people, while the state news agency mena said earlier that the number might be as high as 600. the boat was located nearly 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) from the nile delta port city of rosetta when it sank. it had waited at sea for many hours — perhaps days — for smaller wooden boats carrying migrants to arrive from different points along the egyptian coastline. survivors said that overcrowding caused the boat to capsize. egyptian officials said that over 160 people were rescued and that the majority are egyptians, while the others are sudanese and other nationalities, including somalians and eritreans. the head of the local council in the area, ali abdel-sattar, said that the currents have carried the bodies of the victims many kilometers away from the site of the sinking. "today, four bodies, including two egyptian children, were found 20 kilometers to the east," he told the ap. he added that many of the migrants are believed to have been "stored in the bottom of the boat, in the fridge." "those are the ones who drowned first, most probably stuck, and their bodies might not be retrieved anytime soon," he said, adding, "those we found are the ones liberated from the boat. i believe many are stuck and now laying in the bottom of the sea." he said the boat may now have sunk to 16 meters (yards) below sea level. the eu border agency, frontex, recently said more than 12,000 migrants arrived in italy from egypt between january and september this year, compared to 7,000 in the same period last year. yet unhcr says that since 2014 there has been a steady increase in the number of people intercepted while trying to leave egypt, with 4,600 people arrested this year, a 28-percent increase compared to the previous year. on thursday, four people described as members of the vessel's crew were arrested over charges of human trafficking and manslaughter. at a small pier called el-borg, hundreds of families had gathered friday, hoping to identify the bodies of their loved ones. women screamed and relatives pushed and shoved while swarming the ambulances heading to the hospital. fishermen said that they had difficulty collecting the badly decomposed bodies, with one saying, "we didn't know how to pull them out." survivors and relatives told the ap earlier that the boat sank around 5:30 a.m. on wednesday, and that it took coast guards around six hours to come to the rescue. fishing boats in the vicinity were the first to provide help. "i have never seen such a large number of people drowning in the waters as i saw that day," a 42-year-old fisherman told ap. he said he arrived at 11 a.m. in the morning and helped the survivors. "we threw the ropes, we pulled them in, and many were unconscious. the strong majority are youngsters," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of security fears. many of the survivors were briefly detained by police. some of those rescued were taken to hospitals, where they lay handcuffed to beds and under police guard. the egyptian news portal, al-youm al-sabei, published interviews with several survivors who said that before their journey the migrants had been "stored" for several days in chicken farms by the traffickers to evade police. some of the interviewees said the traffickers asked for $6250 per family, to be given on arrival in italy. after his release, survivor ahmed darwish said, "my advice is that no one should undertake this risk, and especially anyone who saw these things, they will never do it again." the international organization for migration has said that this year over 3,500 have died while attempting to cross the mediterranean to europe, with this number "rapidly approaching" the record death toll set last year. those who chose to risk the dangerous journey are often fleeing war and poverty in the middle east and elsewhere. ——— michael contributed to this story from cairo, egypt      162 bodies retrieved after migrant boat capsizes off egypt      
__label__0 when hillary clinton attacked donald trump for not releasing his tax returns and allegedly paying zero in federal income taxes, the republican presidential nominee had just four words to say in response. “that makes me smart,” trump said from the debate stage at hofstra university tonight.     he has said repeatedly he is being audited by the irs and cannot release his tax statements until the review is concluded. but during the first general-election presidential debate, in hempstead, new york, the real estate mogul vowed to release his tax returns “against my lawyer’s wishes” if clinton releases emails she deleted from a private server she used while she was secretary of state. “as soon as she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted, as soon as she releases them,” trump said tonight, amid cheers and applause, “i will release my tax returns.” the white house hopefuls also clashed repeatedly over their tax plans during the debate, with clinton accusing trump of proposing the “most extreme version” of “trickle-down economics.” “the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in county than we’ve ever had,” the democratic presidential nominee said from the stage. “i call it trumped-up trickle-down because that’s exactly what it would be. that is not how we grow the economy.” before trump had a chance to defend his tax policy, clinton took another jab. “donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit,” she continued. “he started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. i don't buy that.” trump, who released his tax plan earlier this month, has proposed tax cuts across the board, including income tax reductions for the top 1 percent and eliminating federal estate tax as well as gift taxes. meanwhile, clinton has called for tax hikes for the wealthiest americans and closing corporate loopholes that allow the rich to evade some tariffs. trump fired back, blaming “politicians like secretary clinton” for plunging the nation into debt. “we’re a debtor nation,” he said. “we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. and we don’t have the money because it’s been squandered on so many of your ideas.” clinton suggested that trump’s alleged failure to pay federal income tax might also be part of the problem. but trump quickly argued any taxes he would have paid would have gone to waste. “it would be squandered too, believe me,” he said. abc news' nicole phillip, maggie mcnish and sunny choo contributed to this report.      donald trump, hillary clinton spar over taxes in first presidential debate

__label__1 we’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. one of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after george hw bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. what donald trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in chelsea and minnesota may have that beat: .@jasonmillerindc: statement on last weekend’s terror attacks https://t.co/dzlivkchmb pic.twitter.com/l3evtvlcfo — official team trump (@teamtrump) september 19, 2016  take a look at that and consider what it says. the personal attacks on president obama and secretary clinton aside, trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in america. he didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil. let’s imagine for a moment that trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. while the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in america. he’s talking about profiling muslims. he’s talking about donald trump’s version of the patriot act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.the man being hunted by the fbi, for example, isn’t just a muslim, he’s an the man being hunted by the fbi, for example, isn’t just a muslim, he’s an american citizen with the right to due process. just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. with this blanket trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. there’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play. what that means is that under trump’s dream regime, we could expect muslim heavy neighborhoods like dearborn and queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. without a way to differentiate christian arabs from muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? if you think i’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an american presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. it isn’t about the narrative. it isn’t about prevention or education. it’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. it may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, donald trump just became even more frightening. the only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. the thought of turning our streets into a denzel washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. like the rest of donald trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons. featured image from file

__label__0 estero, florida (cnn)donald trump, speaking two days after the latest terrorist attack on us soil, sought to paint his rival hillary clinton as a "weak and ineffective" leader not prepared to confront the threat of radical islamic terrorism, as he talked up his radical policy prescriptions. the republican presidential nominee, addressing more than 8,000 people at his first rally since the bomb attacks in new york and new jersey, talked up his hardline immigration policies, argued domestic terror suspects, even us citizens, should be tried as "foreign enemy combatants" -- rather than receive due process under us law. he also slammed clinton for what he said was being tougher on his supporters than on islamist terrorism. "hillary clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about radical islamic terrorists," trump said, pointing to clinton's comments that half his supporters belong in a "basket of deplorables." "has she ever talked that way about radical islam? no," trump said. "are those words reserved only for hard-working americans who truly love our country and they want to make a statement? one can be forgiven for getting the impression that these hardworking americans are somehow a greater threat to our country than these islamic extremists." clinton has, in fact, discussed terrorism. earlier in the day, she touted her national security experience from serving as secretary of state, saying she would "launch an intelligence surge" and that she would put more into "training and intelligence they need to effectively prevent and respond to terrorist attacks." rather than the policies of president barack obama's administration, which trump argued are responsible for the threat of terrorism, trump called once again for a radical rethinking of counterterrorism policies in the us. he emphasized the need for "extreme vetting" and again called for a ban on immigrants from countries that are hotbeds of terrorism -- the latest iteration of his ban on muslims -- while arguing that "immigration security is national security." "my opponent has the most open borders policy of anyone ever to seek the presidency," trump said. and championing the cause of many hawkish conservatives, trump appeared to argue that terrorist suspects captured on us soil like ahmad khan rahami, the new york and new jersey bombing suspect who was apprehended earlier monday, should be treated as "foreign enemy combatants." rahami is a naturalized us citizen who under current law is entitled to due process rights. "congress should pass measures to ensure that foreign enemy combatants are treated as such. these are enemies. these are combatants and we have to be tough and we have to be strong," trump said. those comments came after trump lamented the fact that rahami would be treated humanely and in accordance with the law. "he will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. he will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. and he'll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is," trump said. "we must also use whatever lawful methods are available to obtain information from the apprehended suspect to get information before it's no longer timely," he added. trump also responded to clinton's accusations earlier monday that trump and his harsh rhetoric against muslims has been a recruiting tool for isis. clinton had said: "i think it is important for voters to know and hear this and weigh it in making their choice in november. we know that a lot of the rhetoric we've heard from donald trump has been seized on by terrorists, in particular isis. because they are looking to make this into a war against islam." "her attacks on me are all meant to deflect from her record of unleashing this monster of evil on us," trump said. instead, trump boomeranged clinton's attack back at her, arguing that clinton and president barack obama's policies have helped isis's recruiting efforts. "weakness invites aggression and silence in the face of a brutal enemy ... allows them to spread and that's what's happening all over the world," trump said. the republican nominee also speculated, without evidence, that if obama could do it again he wouldn't choose clinton to serve in his cabinet.       trump labels clinton 'weak and ineffective' in wake of bombings      
__label__0 united nations (cnn)president barack obama took to the most prominent international stage tuesday to deliver a stark warning to american voters of the dire global consequences they face should they embrace isolationism and ultra-nationalism in november. never mentioning republican presidential nominee donald trump by name, the president's final address to the united nations general assembly was at heart an impassioned rebuke of the gop candidate's policies on trade, immigration and multiculturalism -- and a defense of liberalism and tolerance -- delivered 49 days before votes are cast for his replacement. he painted a dark picture of the future awaiting americans, and the world, if the forces of "aggressive nationalism" or "crude populism" win out. and he specifically inveighed against building a wall -- a centerpiece of trump's proposal on border security. "a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself," obama declared to the assembled representatives of the un's member states. gone were obama's idealistic appeals to bring about a world free of nuclear weapons and an agenda focused on peace, as were his previous un addresses. the "hope and change" of his argument as a presidential candidate himself was also replaced by exhortations against a future filled with chaos. "time and again human beings have believed they finally arrived at a period of enlightenment, only to repeat cycles of conflict and suffering. perhaps that's our fate," obama suggested. "we have to remember the choices of individual human beings led to repeated world war," obama said. "each of us as leaders, each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best. for we have shown that we can choose a better history." he pointed to growing divisions and discontent at home that challenge those decisions, and noted that the shortcomings of globalization had created "an uncertainty and unease and strife" that required acknowledgement, but not turning inward. "i believe that at this moment we all face a choice," obama said. "we can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration or we can retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion. i want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not back." it was obama's eighth and final address to the un body, which enthusiastically welcomed him in 2009 after he moved to reverse the unilateral approach of his predecessor george w. bush. in his speech that year, obama vowed to work within international bodies to confront the world's crises while pushing an agenda combating climate change and nuclear non-proliferation. but in the intervening years, the harsh realities of diplomacy settled in, both for obama and the un. the organization's inability to stem suffering in syria and ukraine laid bare the continued struggles to combat breaches of international law, while obama's own work toward combating violent extremists has failed to stop terrorist groups from committing atrocities. obama's address tuesday reflected those realities. he drew titters from the collection of world leaders and diplomats in the high-ceilinged general assembly hall when he noted that "at times both america's adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems were either caused by washington or could be solved by washington. and perhaps too many in washington believe that, as well." he made scant mention of individual world flash points, choosing instead to offer a more thematic recap of his foreign agenda. "the world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before. and yet our societies are filled with uncertainty and unease and strife," obama said. "despite enormous progress, as people lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult and tensions between nations become more quick to surface." related: clinton, trump meet world leaders for very different reasons obama continued his tradition at the un of acknowledging areas where the us has fallen short in its practice of democracy, saying his country and other developed nations must set a better example for emerging democracies. citing the pervasive role of money in politics, entrenched party allegiances and a patchwork of voting laws, obama said it was up to long-established nations to show the way forward. "those of us who believe in democracy, we need to speak out forcefully. because both the facts and history is on our side," obama said. "we better strive harder to set a better example at home." obama used his own efforts to help revive a stalled economy as an example of us leadership during his tenure, saying other countries would be wise to follow his lead of going after corruption and unfair tax policies. he also cited the deal with iran to curtain its nuclear program, and reopening of ties with cuba and myanmar, as examples of a successful global approach. related: global leaders at un tackle world's worst to-do list but the array of places where obama's approach hasn't yielded the outcomes he projected during his first appearance here in 2009 were also unavoidable. that includes his inability to negotiate peace between israel and the palestinians -- a major topic in his first four un addresses that was entirely absent during last year's speech. this year, the president took issue with both sides' actions toward one another. he criticized israeli settlements, saying the only path to mideast peace will come when the two sides reconcile deeply held differences. palestinians must "reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of israel," obama said. but he also said peace won't come until "israel recognizes it cannot permanently occupy and settle palestinian land." obama plans to meet israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on wednesday to "discuss the need for genuine advancement of a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict in the face of deeply troubling trends on the ground," according to white house press secretary josh earnest. another persisting crisis -- russia's continued incursion into ukraine -- also drew obama's attention tuesday. "in a world that left the age of empire behind, we see russia attempting to recover lost glory through force," obama said. "if russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it may be popular at home. it may fuel nationalist fervor for a time. over time, it's also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure." indeed, many of his harshest warnings were aimed at global government practices that damage democracy and liberalism and called for the rejection of strongmen, authoritarian and tribalism. "there appears to be growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now," he told the assembled leaders. "and i want everybody to understand, i am not neutral in that contest."       obama at un warns americans against walls and nationalism      
__label__0 cleveland heights, ohio (cnn)the controversial boxing promoter don king used the n-word while introducing donald trump during an event wednesday at a church. king, who is black, said the word as he argued that african-americans cannot achieve success by emulating white people, as they will remain "negroes." "if you're poor, you are a poor negro -- i would use the n-word -- but if you're rich, you are a rich negro. if you are intelligent, intellectual, you are intellectual negro. if you are a dancing and sliding and gliding n***** -- i mean negro -- you are a dancing and sliding and gliding negro," king said, laughing along with the crowd after the slip-up. "you're going to be a negro 'til you die." trump, who was already smirking as he listened to king, didn't change the expression on his face, but turned slightly uncomfortably to his special counsel michael cohen and the church's pastor, darrell scott, who head up trump's diversity coalition. trump, who said he personally invited king to introduce him, was sitting in a chair onstage just a few feet away from king when he uttered the word. taking the stage moments later, trump called king a "phenomenal persona" and said: "ah, there's only one don king." during his speech, king praised trump as "fearless," "courageous and brave" and said he believed trump would "take this system apart" and "create a whole new system." "the system is corrupt, the system is rigged, the system is sexist, the system is racist," king said, arguing that trump would bring the country "back to inclusiveness." king's mere presence at trump's side is controversial: king was convicted of second-degree murder for stomping a man to death in 1966. the governor of ohio later pardoned king for the crime in 1983. john lewis calls for election observers at polling places this november wednesday's moment came as trump pitched himself as a president who would help bring jobs and safety to impoverished minority communities during the event at scott's church. there, trump was flanked by a number of his prominent black surrogates, including ben carson and former "apprentice" star omarosa manigault. later, as trump fielded questions from scott on a range of issues affecting religious and minority communities, king stood on stage by trump, interjecting infrequently to shout about the "system." warily eying king, manigault suggested king take a seat, but the boxing promoter declined. moments later, as trump's supporters gathered around him to pray for trump, king grabbed trump's wrist and raised their arms above their heads, as he would with a champion boxer. trump appeared to let his hand go limp, and then, unsure what to do, closed his hand to make a fist. just a few hours later, king flew with the real estate mogul aboard trump's plane to his rally in toledo, ohio, where he introduced gop vice presidential nominee mike pence.       don king drops n-word while introducing donald trump

__label__0 washington (cnn)members of the house oversight and government reform committee voted along party lines thursday to hold the architect of hillary clinton's private email server in contempt for failing to appear before them. the panel's 19-15 vote came after bryan pagliano failed to attend a second hearing on clinton's emails and use of a private server while leading the state department. republicans blasted his decision as an act of defiance, but pagliano's lawyers said the demand that he appear "betrays a naked political agenda." house oversight chairman jason chaffetz, a utah republican, argued that previous testimony from another one of clinton's it workers, justin cooper, made it imperative for pagliano to testify. "i explained mr. pagliano was uniquely qualified to provide testimony to help the committee better understand secretary clinton's use of a private email server. this is indisputable," chaffetz said. "i also made clear the committee would consider all options regarding mr. pagliano's failure to appear, including consideration of recommending he be held in contempt." related: road to 270: cnn's latest electoral college map pagliano was first called before the oversight committee last week but did not appear. pagliano pleaded the fifth amendment in a closed-door hearing last year of the house panel investigating the benghazi attacks. it is unclear when the full house would take up a vote on the contempt resolution approved thursday. pagliano's lawyers accused chaffetz of launching a witch hunt. "a subpoena issued by a congressional committee is required by law to serve a valid legislative purpose -- and there is none here. your demand under the present circumstances, that mr. pagliano again assert his constitutional rights in front of video cameras six weeks before the presidential election, betrays a naked political agenda and furthers no valid legislative aim," pagliano's lawyers wrote in a letter to the committee on wednesday. related: how to watch the first presidential debate rep. elijah cummings, the top democrat on the panel, defended pagliano's refusal to appear. "there is no legitimate legislative purpose in forcing mr. pagliano to appear before the committee to assert his fifth amendment rights before congress for a second time, and there is certainly no legitimate legislative purpose in forcing him to do so in public," cummings said thursday. the clinton campaign said thursday it had not told pagliano whether or not to testify, and blasted the oversight hearings into her private email server. "he made his own decision, but we certainly have not prevailed upon anyone to cooperate with this sham of an inquiry," clinton spokesman brian fallon said. "the career officials at the fbi and the justice department already thoroughly investigated this matter, and closed the case with no further action, and jason chaffetz is abusing his office with this blatantly partisan attempt to hurt hillary clinton's presidential campaign."       house oversight panel votes clinton it chief in contempt      
__label__0 (cnn)hillary clinton's campaign has a question for voters: is donald trump the president we want for our daughters? the clinton campaign will begin airing a new ad friday that intercuts trump insulting women with shots of young girls looking in the mirror. "i'd look her right in that fat ugly face of hers," trump says in the ad, a comment he made in 2006 about comedian rosie o'donnell. "she is a slob." the ad, entitled "mirrors," also features trump saying "a person who is flat chested is very hard to be a 10" -- a comment he made about actress nicollette sheridan -- and "does she have a good body, no? does she have a fat (expletive)? absolutely." -- a comment he made about kim kardashian in 2013. while these comments are playing, the ad features a diverse group of young women looking in the mirror, appearing to evaluate themselves as trump's voice makes demeaning comments. the end of the ad features a black slate with this question: "is this the president we want for our daughters?" the ad will air ohio, new hampshire, iowa, florida, nevada, north carolina, pennsylvania and on national cable, according to a campaign release. the release did not say how much money was being spent on the ad. throughout her campaign, clinton has argued that trump would be ill-equipped president to handle issues that matter to women and girls. "anyone who wants to defund planned parenthood and wipe out safe, legal abortion has no idea what's best for women," clinton said in june. "and after all, this is a man who has called women 'pigs,' 'dogs,' and 'disgusting animals.' kind of hard to imagine counting on him to respect our fundamental rights." clinton's new ad is the latest that goes after trump's character and mimics an ad priorities usa, her top-dollar super pac, released in may that similarly questioned a comment trump made about respecting women.       new clinton ad shows girls looking in mirror as trump insults women

"he's built an amazing company. he's become the epitome of the american dream." trump begun to say that millennials could relate to his father because "he's gone from just about nothing," but was interrupted by "outnumbered" panelist julie roginsky. "nothing? he got a million bucks? i mean, come on," roginsky interjected. "listen, he's built an unbelievable empire," trump responded. "he's epitomized what america is all about: opportunity and working hard and being able to achieve your dreams and what you want to succeed, right?" trump continued, "it's no different from a (mark) zuckerberg, right, who went out with a great idea like facebook and developed this idea and built it and grew it and grew it and grew it. that's achieving something, right? and i think it is very different than a person who has been career politician." in 2015, donald trump described the $1 million loan from his father as "small." "my whole life really has been a 'no' and i fought through it," trump said at an nbc-sponsored town hall in october. "it has not been easy for me, it has not been easy for me. and you know i started off in brooklyn, my father gave me a small loan of a million dollars." the 32-year-old eric trump on friday also said that he thought millennials did not relate to policy well because "they haven't lived their lives long enough to understand ... the broad stroke of issues." "they obviously understand a lot of issues as it pertains to them, student debt, and this and that," trump said. "but i think maybe taxes and things might be a little less significant than other issues. and so i just think there is a disconnect between somebody who is constantly talking about policy and this and that, than a man who's built a great company." donald trump's children have become prominent surrogates for his unconventional presidential campaign, but at times have cause minor controversies of their own. eric trump's comments come after his older brother, donald jr., caused controversy earlier this week when he likened syrian refugees to skittles.       eric trump: my father started with 'just about nothing'      
__label__0 washington (cnn)green party presidential nominee jill stein was escorted off the hofstra university campus monday after her prearranged media interviews because she didn't have credentials to be there. stein's campaign told cnn that she was at the university doing press interviews and was escorted off after an interview with msnbc. "we were on our way to an interview with @msnbc when we were stopped by hofstra security and nassau county police just now. #debatenight" she tweeted. the nassau county police department told cnn that stein failed to provide the proper credentials at the university, which led to her being escorted off campus. "she was on the college campus, we asked to verify for proper credentials, she did not have them, and she was nicely escorted off the campus," a police department spokeswoman said. stein told msnbc in an earlier interview monday that she would try to get on the debate stage despite failing to meet the requirements needed to participate. "well, what i am really hoping to accomplish is what the american people are hoping to accomplish, which is to open up the debates so we have a fair and inclusive debate at a time where the american people rejected the two establishment candidates at record levels," she said. "they have a right not only to vote -- they have a right to know who we can vote for." stein, along with libertarian candidate gary johnson, failed to qualify for the first presidential debate. the candidates needed to make a 15% polling threshold across several major national surveys in order to qualify for the debates. the commission determined that the polling averages for the candidates had stein at 3.2% and johnson at 8.4%. cnn's samantha reyes contributed to this report.      stein escorted off hofstra university campus      
__label__0 (cnn)donald trump and his running mate appeared to be on different pages tuesday on whether climate change is man made. roughly an hour after trump campaign manager kellyanne conway said the real estate mogul does not believe global warming is a man-made phenomenon, gop vice presidential nominee mike pence appeared to take the opposite view. "well, look, there's no question that the activities that take place in this country and in countries around the world have some impact on the environment and some impact on climate," pence said during an appearance with host chris cuomo on cnn's "new day." clinton puts trump on defense at first debate but during her own appearance on the program earlier tuesday morning, conway said trump "believes that global warming is naturally occurring," and confirmed the candidate does not believe it is man made. the trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. there is near universal consensus in the scientific community that climate change is man made. conway and pence were both asked to clarify the campaign's position on the issue following monday night's debate, when hillary clinton accused trump of believing that climate change "a hoax perpetrated by the chinese." trump flatly denied that, even though he has called climate change a "hoax" repeatedly in the past. in a tweet from 2012, for example, trump said that the "concept of global warming was created by and for the chinese in order to make u.s. manufacturing non-competitive." trump later claimed he was only joking. in his interview on tuesday, pence dismissed that tweet as "humorous," and said that he and trump are opposed to certain environmental policies. "what donald trump said was a hoax is that bureaucrats in washington, d.c., can control the climate of the earth and the reality is that this climate change agenda that barack obama and hillary clinton want to continue to expand is killing jobs in this country," he said. pence faced another question about a conflicting position on the gop ticket when he was asked about the trans-pacific partnership, or tpp, trade legislation he initially supported but that trump has longed opposed. "i wholly agree with donald trump's view about tpp," pence said.       mike pence appears at odds with trump on climate change      
__label__0 (cnn)as hillary clinton on monday night reeled off a litany of insults he had leveled against women through the years, including some nasty nicknames for a former miss universe, donald trump leaned into his microphone and asked repeatedly, "where did you find this? where did you find this?" the clinton campaign need not have looked far, or particularly hard, to turn up instances of the republican presidential nominee speaking in cold or cruel ways about women. trump has made a habit of it over the years, targeting public figures, even his own wives and girlfriends. on tuesday, trump even added to the list, calling into fox news and explaining why he'd alternately described former miss universe alicia machado as "miss piggy" and "miss housekeeping." "she was the winner (of the pageant), and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem," trump said. "we had a real problem." the trump campaign has pushed back against suggestions his past comments betrayed any lack of respect for women. "mr. trump has tremendous relationships with women," spokeswoman hope hicks told cnn in an email, noting the presence of high-ranking female officials within his campaign and company. "to say otherwise is wholly inaccurate and based on unsubstantiated claims from publicity hungry individuals." but many of trump's nastiest affronts are matters of public record. and voters have noticed -- even as he gained in recent polls, clinton's lead among women remained considerable, usually up around 20 points. here is an incomplete list of his insults over the years: critical women during the first republican primary event in august 2015, fox news' megyn kelly challenged him over his past comments about women. trump didn't like it. "you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes," he told cnn's don lemon after the fact. "blood coming out of her ... wherever." his feud with kelly would stretch on. before it was informally settled, he would retweet another twitter user who posted images form kelly's gq magazine photo shoot and called her a "bimbo." trump and rosie o'donnell have sparred for years -- right through monday night. during her time on abc's "the view," o'donnell had disparaged trump as a "snake-oil salesman" and discussed his bankruptcy. trump has been especially harsh in return. in this clip from a 2006 entertainment tonight segment, he called o'donnell a "slob." "if i were running 'the view,' i'd fire rosie. i'd look her right in that fat ugly face of hers, i'd say, 'rosie, you're fired,' " he said, channeling his reality tv tagline. "we're all a little chubby, rosie is just a little worse than most of us. but it's not just the chubbiness. rosie is a very unattractive person, both inside and out." in august 2012, he mocked arianna huffington, whose ex-husband michael revealed he was gay a year after their marriage ended in 1997, tweeting that she was "unattractive both inside and out. i fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision." better midler, too, has come under fire from trump. in the space of six minutes on october 28, 2012, he tweeted at the singer and actress twice, first calling her "grotesque," then adding: "while @bettemidler is an extremely unattractive woman, i refuse to say that because i always insist on being politically correct." a year earlier, new york times columnist gail collins wrote about a note she had received from trump. "during one down period, i referred to him in print as a 'financially embattled thousandaire,'" collins recalled, "and he sent me a copy of the column with my picture circled and 'the face of a dog!' written over it." on their mental health more recently, he responded angrily to another times columnist, maureen dowd, who suggested during an interview on cnn that trump "thought the violence (at his rallies) added a frisson of excitement." first, trump tweeted that dowd was "wacky" and a "neurotic dope." in a second post, he called her "crazy maureen dowd." earlier in the summer, he had used similar terms to smear now-former democratic national committee chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz and msnbc host mika brzezinski. wasserman schultz was "highly neurotic," while he described brzezinski, who had been critical on her show, as "off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess!" and don't forget supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg. during a brief back-and-forth for which she eventually apologized, trump tweeted: "her mind is shot - resign! crude gender stereotypes in a clip turned up by hbo's john oliver, trump discusses with a female reporter how contestants at his beauty pageant are judged. then comments on her own appearance (at 4:56). there is a pattern. the future gop nominee offered this assessment in his 1997 book, "trump: the art of the comeback": "women have one of the great acts of all time," he wrote. "the smart ones act very feminine and needy, but inside they are real killers. the person who came up with the expression 'the weaker sex' was either very naive or had to be kidding. i have seen women manipulate men with just a twitch of their eye -- or perhaps another body part." when discussing whether he might want more children with his third wife during a 2005 visit to radio host howard stern, trump explained his paternal role as such: "i mean, i won't do anything to take care of them. i'll supply funds and she'll take care of the kids. it's not like i'm gonna be walking the kids down central park." more recently, as he again considered a run for office, trump tweeted that the presence of women, simply by their presence in the ranks, were to blame for sexual assault in the military. "26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military-only 238 convictions," he tweeted in may 2013. "what did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?" public, sex-specific insults before he turned on maureen dowd, trump last summer told the columnist that, "sadly," the supermodel heidi klum is "no longer a 10." a few months earlier, the not-yet-candidate retweeted a fan who posted a question: "if hillary clinton can't satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy america?" trump deleted his own post, blaming it on a rogue staffer. by the fall of 2015, trump was a leading candidate for the republican nomination. during an interview with rolling stone he commented on his primary rival, carly fiorina. this was the scene, as reporter paul solotaroff described it in his story: "when the anchor throws to carly fiorina for her reaction to trump's momentum, trump's expression sours in schoolboy disgust as the camera bores in on fiorina. 'look at that face!' he cries. 'would anyone vote for that? can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!' what he said to the face of "celebrity apprentice" contestant and former playboy playmate, brande roderick, during a 2013 show left her blank-faced. "it must be a pretty picture," trump said. "you dropping to your knees." disgust at normal bodily functions at a campaign event in december 2015, he remarked on clinton's slightly delayed return from a bathroom break during a recent democratic primary debate. "i know where she went, it's disgusting, i don't want to talk about it," trump said. "no, it's too disgusting. don't say it, it's disgusting, let's not talk, we want to be very, very straight up." it wasn't the first time trump had expressed some revulsion at something so mundane. in july 2015, attorney elizabeth beck told cnn's alisyn camerota that trump a few years earlier had suffered an "absolute meltdown" after she requested a break to pump breast milk. "he got up," beck said, "his face got red, he shook his finger at me and he screamed, 'you're disgusting, you're disgusting,' and he ran out of there."       donald trump's trouble with women -- an incomplete list

__label__1 i can’t wait for “weekend at chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. cnn and the rest of hillary clinton’s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. if this woman, god forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the clinton campaign talking points and call it a “minor setback” to her “inevitable” victory. the american people aren’t buying it. this is a severely ill woman. no more “conspiracy theory” dismissals. mrs. clinton’s “mild cold,” er, “seasonal allergies,” i mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “minor case of pneumonia” is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “mystery man” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “episodes” (or otherwise freezes up with a brain “short-circuit” during a speech). this guy has been spotted with the clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a diazepam pen. diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures. blue tinted glasses of the sort mrs. clinton was wearing sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. these therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of parkinson’s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate mrs. clinton likely suffers (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological squeeze test?). the clinton campaign needs to come clean. they won’t, but they should. i wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm secret service agents acting as though they’ve been there a hundred times before. “nothing to see here, folks. secretary clinton’s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday going door-to-door.” the point is that, once more, by lying about illness mrs. clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. she’s proven, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. she has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. she’s a liar. that’s her default mode. she’s corrupt. and she’s sick. very sick. she puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life. do i take joy in mrs. clinton’s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? well, no on the first, yes on the second. “do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice” (proverbs 24:17). indeed, mrs. clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of donald trump’s supporters as a “racist” and “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables,” has only served to accelerate the plunge. perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman. this is the same hillary clinton who once called the late sen. robert byrd, d-w.va., her “friend and mentor.” sen. byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable kkk. this is the same hillary clinton whose husband, former president bill clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that president obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose democratic party opposed the 1964 civil rights act while republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same hillary clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the u.s. while hundreds-of-thousands of republicans gave up their lives to free them. who’s the racist? i’m praying for hillary clinton. despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. to watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. you can’t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be. it’s almost tragic to witness. hillary clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. everything she’s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous bs she’s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the oval office, not as first lady, but as president of the united states. proverbs 19:21 says, “many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the lord’s purpose that prevails.” am i saying there’s no chance hillary clinton will win? not at all, though i think it unlikely. between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there’s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory. still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for hillary clinton’s political aspirations. even so, i also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee. when they visit her in prison.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      is it the beginning of the end for hillary clinton?

__label__0 wells fargo's embattled ceo is resigning his position on the federal reserve's advisory council amid a scandal over millions of accounts allegedly opened by the bank without customers' permission. the san francisco fed said thursday that john stumpf is giving up his position as representative from the central bank's san francisco region on the advisory council. the move was a "personal decision" by stumpf, wells fargo spokeswoman jennifer dunn said. "his top priority is leading wells fargo." his resignation from the council, which meets four times a year with the fed's board of governors to discuss economic and banking issues, was effective immediately. members serve one-year terms starting in january. the announcement came two days after stumpf faced bipartisan outrage from a senate panel over the alleged misconduct, believed to have gone on at the second-largest u.s. bank for years. some 5,300 employees were fired. wells fargo & co., which is based in san francisco, was fined $185 million by u.s. and california regulators earlier this month. in a feverish drive to meet sales targets, bank employees opened the unauthorized accounts, transferred customers' money into them, and signed people up for online banking, according to the regulators. debit cards were issued and activated, as well as pins created, without customers' knowledge. stumpf told the senate banking committee in his testimony tuesday he was "deeply sorry" the bank failed to meet its responsibility to customers and didn't act sooner to stem the misconduct. he promised to assist affected customers. the bank says it has already refunded to customers $2.6 million in fees charged for products that were sold without authorization. senators of both parties accused the bank of fraud and told stumpf he was scapegoating legions of lower-level employees while senior executives kept their jobs and received hefty pay packages. stumpf, a 34-year veteran of wells fargo and ceo since 2007, earned $19.3 million last year. carrie tolstedt, the former head of the retail banking business, announced in july that she would retire from the bank this year. she is expected to leave with as much as $125 million in salary, stock options and other compensation. the bank says it will end its sales quota system at year's end. while it varied by branch size and day of the week, a typical employee had to sell between 13 and 15 banking products a day — a new account, a mortgage, a retirement account, or even online banking. the targets were high even in small towns.      wells fargo ceo resigns position on fed advisory body      
__label__0 in the chaos and fog of a brutal conflict that has claimed an estimated 400,000 to 500,000 lives, a ragtag group of former bakers, tailors, salespeople, teachers, pharmacists, painters, carpenters and students has emerged as real-life heroes, providing a glimmer of hope in syria's brutal five-year-old civil war. the syria civil defense group, otherwise known as the white helmets, get their inspiration from an oft-quoted verse of the quran: "to save a life is to save all of humanity." so far, the group of about 3,000 white helmets have performed that feat some 60,000 times, often working in perilous conditions surrounded by violent conflict. on thursday, the group won the right livelihood award, often described as the "alternative nobel." the group has also been nominated for the nobel peace prize, with the support of over 133 organizations worldwide so far.   their job may be the most dangerous in the world. comprised of unpaid volunteers using whatever supplies they can get their hands on, the white helmets often place their own lives at risk, venturing into active battle zones to assist the sick and wounded. "we go to save as many people as we can," says white helmet khaled farah. if one person was alive, that's enough for us to take the risk." so far, some 132 white helmet volunteers have been killed in the line of duty, the majority from so-called "double-tap" strikes, where warplanes will drop a second bomb in the same spot of an initial strike as people rush in to aid the wounded and remove the dead. "i help civilians every day, knowing that this will give my daughter and my country a better future," says another white helmet, known simply as fatima. their motto is "humanity, solidarity, impartiality,” and the group says it services some seven million people in vulnerable areas of the country, some of which have been racked by unremitting violence. when not conducting rescue missions, the volunteers teach children and adults on safety measures to take during aerial attacks, help provide first aid and medical services, assist in the the evacuation of civilian populations from active conflict zones and help re-establish critical infrastructure like water and electricity. on friday, the associated press reported that at least two civil defense centers were targeted in a renewed bombing campaign just days after a ceasefire backed by the u.s. and russia unraveled. more than 13 million people require humanitarian assistance of some kind across syria. some 6 million people have been forced from their homes in the country — nearly 1 million of them in the past six months alone. of particular concern are the nearly 600,000 syrians the united nations estimates are living in besieged areas, cut off from regular access to basic necessities and living with the daily threat of deadly violence.      who are the syrian white helmets, winners of the 'alternative nobel'?      
__label__0 in a letter shared with abc news, six senators have slammed wells fargo bank for its use of forced arbitration clauses in its customer account agreements, which the senators say enabled the company to keep its accounts scandal out of the public eye and the courts for years, and asked embattled ceo john stumpf to provide information so that they can “better understand the situation at wells fargo” and "prevent similar fraudulent practices in the future." arbitration, mandated in some if not all basic agreements that customers sign when they open accounts at the bank, "helps hide fraudulent schemes such as the sham accounts at wells fargo from the justice system, from the news media, and from the public eye," the senators wrote. the senators also write, “these clauses eliminate consumers’ ability to bring a claim in open court or to band together in a class action, before any dispute has arisen. forced arbitration clauses deny access to the courts even when consumers are seeking to enforce their rights under fundamental state and federal laws”. "arbitration proceedings are kept secret, so that other customers are deprived of the knowledge that their experiences might be part of a more widespread problem," according to the six senators. the letter was written by patrick leahy (d-vt), sherrod brown (d-oh), dick durbin (d-il), al franken (d-mn), richard blumenthal (d-ct) and elizabeth warren (d-ma).     "it is particularly unacceptable that forced arbitration clauses in contracts for real customer accounts were used to deny customers access to the court system to challenge wells fargo’s creation of sham accounts," the group wrote. "we have serious concerns that your forced arbitration policies thrust consumers into a system with little transparency or oversight." the letter is the latest in a series of headaches for the company, which faces allegations from regulators that employees opened or applied for accounts without customers' knowledge or permission. on thursday, a group of senators, some of whom also signed today’s letter, asked the department of labor to open an investigation into wells fargo's employment practices, and on tuesday, stumpf appeared before the senate banking committee, facing blistering questions over the accounts scandal. separately on thursday, stumpf resigned from his position on the federal advisory council, the san francisco federal reserve bank told abc news. the council generally meets with the federal reserve four times a year to advise it on banking and economic issues. in a consent decree between the bank and the consumer financial protection bureau, the bank has not admitted to or denied any wrongdoing. arbitration clauses are common in many contracts that consumers sign regularly, attorney david i. greenberger, an employment law expert at the bailey duquette firm in new york city, told abc news. in many cases, they can benefit consumers by allowing parties to settle disputes more quickly and cheaply than if they go through a sometimes long and drawn-out court battle. increasingly, however, concerns have grown that they can be used to keep details out of the public eye, since arbitration proceedings are typically not made public. "the original purpose, from my view ... was that it would allow for a faster, more efficient and more expedient process for the parties to resolve their dispute,” greenberger said. "it has changed over time and i think you can now, in some forms, question whether it’s faster...or [more] expedient," greenberger told abc news. "it’s become a way in which disputes can be kept private and kept from being aggregated in the class context." a wells fargo spokeswoman told abc news: "we are reviewing the letter and will respond to the senators who requested this information but have no further comment at this time."      senators slam wells fargo over arbitration agreements in scathing letter      
__label__0 betty shelby, a white tulsa police officer accused of fatally shooting an unarmed black man, turned herself into the tulsa county jail early this morning, and is now out on bond. she is accused of fatally shooting 40-year-old terence crutcher last friday night. shelby was arrested at 1 a.m. ct today for first-degree manslaughter and she was released less than 30 minutes later on $50,000 bond.  her first court date is scheduled for sept. 30. "officer shelby, although now charged, is presumed to be innocent under the law until a judge or jury determines otherwise," the tulsa county district attorney's office said.  if she is found guilty, first-degree manslaughter carries a prison sentence of at least four years, according to the tulsa county district attorney's office.  shelby has not been fired from the force, the tulsa police department told abc news. now that she’s been charged, the department said it will afford her full due process, and after the trial, the department will complete an internal affairs review and then a determination will be made regarding her employment. she is currently on unpaid leave but was originally put on paid administrative leave until the charge was filed.        after shelby came across crutcher's suv in the middle of a two-lane roadway while it was still running, crutcher ignored dozens of commands shelby gave him, according to her attorney scott wood. she shot him as he allegedly tried to reach his arm into the open driver's side window. crutcher's family attorneys maintain that the window was up, pointing to the blood spattered on it when he was shot. according to an affidavit by an investigator with the tulsa county district attorney's office, shelby reacted "unreasonably by escalating the situation from a confrontation" with crutcher. shelby became "emotionally involved" to the point that she overreacted, the affidavit states, adding that she was "not able to see any weapons or bulges indicating a weapon was present."  on tuesday, days before her arrest, wood told abc news that shelby "is very, very distraught about ... the fact that she has taken a human life. she said the other day in her interview with homicide detectives, 'i was never so scared in my life as in that moment right then.'" "but, at the same time she wants the crutcher family to know she meant no ill will – this was not something that was done out of hate or anger," wood added. "she stopped there that day to try and help somebody. things didn't go the way they should have. he continued, "her actions were objectively reasonable, and she did what she had been trained to do. i don’t think criminal charges would be justified in this scenario." wood did not immediately respond to abc news' request for comment today.  damario solomon-simmons, the attorney for crutcher family, said it was "apparent" that shelby had to be charged because "a crime had been committed." "we are happy that charges were brought," solomon-simmons said in a press conference.

__label__0 a video capturing the moments leading up to and following the fatal police shooting of keith lamont scott, which has sparked days of protests across the city of charlotte, was released by the man’s family today. a woman identified as scott's wife, rakeyia scott, recorded the incident with her cellphone. the footage was provided to abc news by attorneys for the scott family today. in the cellphone video, an suv is seen parked in the street as police repeatedly yell at scott to "drop the gun." scott's wife, who is standing several feet away from the scene, pleads with the officers not to harm her husband. "don't shoot him. don't shoot him," she says. "he has no weapon. he has no weapon." police continue to scream at keith lamont scott: "drop the gun! drop the f---ing gun!" rakeyia scott yells back at police, insisting her husband is harmless and doesn't have a gun. "he doesn't have a gun," she says. "he has a t.b.i. [traumatic brain injury]. he's not going to do anything to you guys. he just took his medicine." one officer can be heard saying, "let me get a f---ing baton over here." rakeyia scott then yells to her husband anxiously, "keith, don't let them break the windows. come out the car!" police order keith lamont scott to "drop the gun" several more times as his wife screams, "keith! keith! don't you do it!" that's when multiple gunshots ring out. the actual shooting is not shown on the video as rakeyia scott points her cellphone at the ground and screams, "did you shoot him?" she then runs closer to the scene, angling the cellphone camera again at the spot where her husband was shot. “he better not be f---ing dead. he better not be f---ing dead,” she yells at police. “he better live. i swear, he better live.” scott's body is seen lying in the street surrounded by several officers. "did you all call an ambulance?" scott's wife asks, before the video cuts out.     according to the charlotte-mecklenburg police department, scott was treated immediately and later pronounced dead. the video is the first footage of scott's encounter with police to be publicly released. investigators have not released the dashboard and body camera videos. the footage is "not great" for investigative purposes because you don't see the officers and you don't know whom scott's wife is speaking to or what she is referring to when she says, "don't do it," said former fbi special agent in-charge rich frankel. "you need a lot of information before you can make an informed decision," frankel told abc news. "you have a lot of people putting out their opinions on what happened. until you more information, it's all hyperbole and guesses." one of the attorneys representing the scott family, charles g. monnett, said they released the video "in the name of truth and transparency." "the family is still hopeful that the charlotte-mecklenburg police department and city of charlotte will release all available video of the incident to the public so that people can draw their own conclusions about keith's death," monnett said. "we encourage everyone to reserve judgment until all the facts are known. this is simply one step in our quest to find the truth for this family." police say scott was holding a handgun, which investigators recovered from an apartment complex in charlotte, and posed a threat because he was not obeying police orders to remain in his vehicle and drop the weapon. an officer subsequently fired his gun, striking scott. police have identified that officer as brentley vinson, who has been employed with the charlotte-mecklenburg police department since july 21, 2014, and is currently assigned to the metro division. he has been placed on paid administrative leave as the investigation continues. vinson was not wearing a body camera at the time, but the other officers who responded to the incident were, police said.   scott’s family has said he was not armed and was holding a book while waiting for his son to be dropped off from school. charlotte-mecklenburg police chief kerr putney said the video evidence alone does not establish probable cause. but the "intent" is to publicly release the video along with other supporting evidence once it's been fully gathered. still, the timing has to be right, he said. the probe into scott's death has now been officially handed over to north carolina's state bureau of investigation, which will be in charge of providing updates and releasing further information on the status of the investigation, according to putney. abc news' brandon baur, darrell calhoun, julia jacobo, eva pilgrim, darren reynolds and seniboye tienabeso contributed to this report.      moments before keith lamont scott's fatal shooting seen in new video      
__label__0 mark cuban will be trolling his business rival donald trump during the first presidential debate. the nba’s dallas mavericks owner tweeted that he'll be sitting front row for the first faceoff between donald trump and hillary clinton, referring to the monday night debate as the "humbling at hofstra."  just got a front row seat to watch @hillaryclinton overwhelm @realdonaldtrump at the "humbling at hofstra" on monday. it is on !  the clinton campaign confirmed it did invite cuban and that his ticket is "one of the best seats we have available" at hofstra university in long island, new york. “i’m excited to see what happens, but i really don’t know what to expect," cuban told abc news today at the red carpet premiere for the abc show "shark tank." "obviously, i’m a not a trump fan. i am a clinton fan," cuban said. "i think she’d make a great president. i don’t think he’s got the skill set. let’s put it this way, if he came on 'shark tank,' i wouldn’t make the investment. i just don’t see him as being capable in the least bit.” cuban officially endorsed clinton for president on twitter on july 29 and introduced her and running-mate sen. tim kaine at their campaign rally the next day in pittsburgh. during an appearance on the netflix show "chelsea," cuban said he even offered to play the role of trump in clinton's mock debates. cuban said he emailed someone on the campaign but never heard back. he has emerged as a critic of trump, questioning whether the new york real estate mogul is actually worth $10 billion, as trump has claimed, and calling on the republican presidential nominee to release his taxes. “what he’s done well is put his name on big buildings. ... he’s good at that. now, whether or not that makes him a billionaire, i don’t know,” cuban said of trump in a june interview on 77 wabc’s “bernie and sid radio show” in new york city. “he’s not transparent enough for us to know that.” cuban trolled trump recently by offering $10 million in exchange for an interview on trump's policies.  .1) @realdonaldtrump $10mm to the charity of your choice if you let me interview you for 4 hrs on your policies and their substance.         cuban called trump "probably the best thing to happen to politics in a long time" in a statement last year on cyber dust, a private messaging app cuban created. in september of last year, cuban gave trump the american airlines center in dallas, where the mavericks play, free of charge for one of his biggest rallies during the fall cycle. at that sept. 14 rally last year, trump called cuban "a great guy" and thanked him for allowing him to use the arena. back in may, during the veepstakes, cuban said on espn radio's “capital games” podcast that he's "wide open" to being a running mate for either candidate. but the relationship between trump and cuban quickly soured.  cuban, in an interview with extra june 21, unloaded on trump: "it’s rare that you see someone get stupider before your eyes, but he’s really working at it. ...you have to give him credit. it’s a difficult thing to do, but he’s accomplished it." cuban went on to explain the reasoning for his 180 on trump. “he sent me an email when i started picking on him. … what happened was i really didn’t like ted cruz, so i started helping donald, tried to encourage him, because i thought he’d be, and to this day thought he’d be a better candidate than ted cruz. ... but at some point, you’ve got to start learning and understanding the issues, you know?” he said in that interview. “donald has been at this a year but you don’t look at him and say, ‘wow, he’s gotten so much smarter on this topic or that topic.' in fact, you look at him and say, ‘what the hell are you talking about?' that’s not good for america.” cuban, 58, told cnn while campaigning with clinton in his hometown of pittsburgh on july 30, "donald initially — i really hoped he would be something different, that as a businessperson, i thought there was an opportunity there. but then he went off the reservation and went bat---- crazy."  cuban and trump, 70, have been rivals for some time. before the campaign kicked off, the two would get into frequent twitter spats. back in 2012, cuban dared trump to shave his head for charity, offering to pay $1 million if trump went through with it. trump subsequently accused cuban of “trying to use me to get publicity for himself," before, months later, saying, cuban “has less tv persona than any other person i can think of. he’s an arrogant, crude, dope who met some very stupid people.”  dummy @mcuban is at it again trying to use me to get publicity for himself!   .@mcuban has less tv persona than any other person i can think of. he’s an arrogant, crude, dope who met some very stupid people...   sorry folks, but donald trump is far richer and much better looking than dopey @mcuban!       donald trump troll mark cuban well positioned for 1st presidential debate

"after further discussion with community leaders, we have decided to postpone sunday's trip as to not impact the city's resources," communications director jennifer palmieri said in a statement. "she will plan to visit charlotte next sunday, provided circumstances allow." scott was fatally shot by officers on tuesday and police reportedly have video that shows that he was holding a gun, though it is unclear if he was pointing a gun in their direction. scott's family has said he was holding a book, not a gun, while waiting for his son to be dropped off from school. after reviewing the footage, the family's attorney said in a statement that it's "impossible" to detect what scott is holding and at no point did scott appear or act aggressively. "after watching the videos, the family again has more questions than answers," justin bamberg, a lawyer representing scott's family, said in the statement thursday. "when told by police to exit his vehicle, mr. scott did so in a very calm, non-aggressive manner. while police did give him several commands, he did not aggressively approach them or raise his hands at members of law enforcement at any time. it is impossible to discern from the videos what, if anything, mr. scott is holding in his hands." family members were privately shown the police video, and they want it to be released publicly. law enforcement officials have said that they intend to release the video but have not determined the appropriate timing. the city's mayor and police chief have said they believe that the video should be released but suggested that if it was released too soon it could impact the ongoing investigation. the state bureau of investigation is leading the investigation. scott's family released footage shot by his wife that shows his confrontation with police officers and the moments before the shooting as well as the aftermath, but it does not show the shooting itself.  we have two names to add to a long list of african americans killed by police officers. it’s unbearable, and it needs to become intolerable.   we've also seen the targeting of police officers—but so many serve every day with courage and honor and are committed to reform.       hillary clinton calls on charlotte police to release shooting video      
__label__0 even as u.s. secretary of state john kerry has renewed his plea for government and opposition forces to stop fighting in syria, the country's city of aleppo was pounded overnight and friday morning by intense bombing. among the victims were 12 members of the same family, including six children, who were killed by airstrikes in the village of bashkateen in aleppo's western countryside today, said the u.k.-based syrian observatory for human rights, which attributed the strikes to syrian government forces. the family was internally displaced, having moved to bashkateen from another syrian town, activists said. in east aleppo, at least 27 people, including two children from one family, were killed by russian and government airstrikes, according to the observatory. many were injured and others are missing, the observatory said. even in this war-weary city, last night's airstrikes were frightening. “my wife and daughter didn’t sleep all night. we were petrified. the sound of the explosions is much worse than usual,” an east aleppo resident told abc news. airstrikes continued friday morning, with three out of four syrian civil defense centers under fire, according to a tweet by the civil defense.  3 of the 4 @syriacivildef centers in aleppo city targeted this morning. 60 air strikes in east aleppo pic.twitter.com/g5seyildby the aleppo media center posted photos on twitter that it said showed damage after attacks on aleppo's qaterji neighborhood.  ???? ?????? ??? ????? ?????? ???? ?????? ?? ???????? ???? ????? ?????? ????? ??? ????? 7 ????? ? 6 ???? ????? ?????.#aleppoamc pic.twitter.com/zzmhovj6tv activists claim that the syrian government and russia have used napalm, phosphorous and cluster bombs in attacks on aleppo since the syrian military declared monday that the cease-fire had ended. abc news has not been able to independently verify these claims.   one out of only two water-pumping stations in aleppo was hit overnight, according to local activists. the two stations are under the control of forces opposed to the syrian government but provide water for both rebel-held eastern aleppo and government-held western aleppo. the attacks thursday and friday followed an announcement from the syrian military that it was launching an offensive against eastern aleppo and offering evacuation corridors for civilians. in the statement, the military urged civilians to stay away from “locations of armed terrorist groups.” residents said the government's move is part of a deliberate policy of forced displacement.   meanwhile, eastern aleppo is still waiting for aid, which was supposed to reach the besieged area during the u.s.-russia-brokered cease-fire. the truce was broken monday when an attack on an aid convoy in western aleppo left at least 21 people dead, including several aid workers. the united nations has 40 trucks with aid ready to enter eastern aleppo. the aid has been sitting by the turkish border since the beginning of last week and is still waiting by the border in syria customs area. once the u.n. gets the green light, the first convoy carrying a month's worth of wheat flour for more than 150,000 people will be sent to aleppo, according to the u.n.’s office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs. the shipment will be followed up by a delivery of enough food rations to feed 35,000 people for a month. “the recent upsurge of violence in east aleppo is obviously a concern for us. however, we are standby,” david swanson, spokesman for the u.n.’s humanitarian affairs office, told abc news. “as humanitarians on the front line we are ready to move. it is now up to the politicians to make this a reality.” the distance from the turkish border to east aleppo is only some 40 miles, but the journey could take about four to five hours. up to 275,000 people in eastern aleppo are in need of humanitarian aid. aid workers have not been able to reach the besieged area since clashes between the syrian government and armed rebel groups started july 7. around 13.5 million people in syria are in need of humanitarian assistance, while 4.8 million have fled their country and 6.1 million are internally displaced, according to this month's figures from the u.n.'s humanitarian affairs office.      aleppo airstrikes kill 12 members of same family, observer group says      
__label__0 election day may be more than six weeks away but, starting today, some voters can cast votes at a physical polling place as statewide in-person, no-excuse voting gets underway in minnesota and south dakota. with more than two-thirds of states offering some kind of early voting, the practice will trend upward in 2016, as it has in recent decades, and will play a major factor in battleground state ballots, some election experts predict. an estimated 34 percent of voters will vote early, according to michael mcdonald, a political science professor at the university of florida and fellow at the brookings institution. the steep climb in early voting has resulted from states’ making early voting more widely available, along with incremental year-to-year increases as voters become more familiar with early-vote procedures, mcdonald told abc news. watch the first presidential debate on abc news and abcnews.com at 9 p.m. et. on monday.     while all states offer absentee voting, 37 states and washington, d.c., will allow some form of early in-person voting this year before election day, according to the national conference of state legislatures. early voting comprises both early absentee voting and early in-person voting. new york, south carolina and michigan are among the states that don't allow early, no-excuse voting. voting early offers flexibility and convenience to voters who may not be able to show up to the polls on nov. 8, or prefer to avoid long lines on election day. whatever the motivation, early voting is likely to make up a significant chunk of the total vote in some key battleground states, josh putnam of the election blog frontloading hq told abc news. he expects large early turnout in florida, georgia, iowa, nevada and north carolina. high early-vote turnout in battleground states is borne out by data from the previous elections. in 2012, early voting made up more than half the overall vote in florida, nevada and north carolina. in georgia, early voting accounted for 48 percent of the overall 2012 vote, and in iowa that percent grew to 43 percent in 2012, up from 35 percent in 2008. while ohio traditionally does not have a big early vote, more than 524,000 absentee ballots had been requested as of this week, according to the associated press. that marks an 8 percent increase of 40,000 compared to this time in the last presidential election. early voting in ohio in 2012 and 2008 comprised some 30 percent of the overall vote. watch the first presidential debate monday at 9 p.m. et. full live coverage and analysis of the debate will begin on abcnews.com/live at 7 p.m. et.      early voting expected to rise in 2016 as in-person balloting begins      
__label__0 an anti-donald trump super pac is going on the offensive ahead of the first presidential debate this monday at hofstra university in new york. the group, the not who we are campaign, is using students at the very university where the debate will be held to make a point. a new web ad produced by the group features students unfriendly to trump's message.     “i don’t think you can have a racist bigot as president,” one student says in the 60-second spot that was filmed on campus. another chimes in, “he makes me terrified.” and a third simply says, “i don’t want him on campus.” the not who we are campaign plans to run the ad on twitter and facebook ahead of and during monday’s debate.   “since the donald himself is coming to campus, these hofstra students are standing up and sending a message that bigotry and hatred are not who we as americans and not who they are as part of the hofstra community,” not who we are’s campaign manager josh hendler said in a statement. hendler’s group bills itself as a venue for “community members and leaders across the country” to “organize their friends, neighbors and coworkers to take a stand against” trump by writing open letters. “we’ll help you craft the language and organize co-workers to take a stand against bigotry and hate,” the group’s website says. the site features letters from companies, universities and groups ranging from members of the clergy to scientists to golfers. one recent letter, written by hofstra student rob bielunas, reads in part: "as a community, hofstra has worked to root out racism, sexism, and xenophobia, the very ideas mr. trump has used to get where he is today. his hateful rhetoric and complete disrespect for his fellow citizens are why we, as members of the hofstra community, stand up against donald j trump’s run for president."      anti-trump super pac launches pre-debate video featuring hofstra students      
__label__0 the two fatal police shootings that occurred in tulsa and charlotte recently have prompted a renewed focus on what police may be able to do to help prevent future such incidents. both hillary clinton and donald trump have discussed their proposals for law enforcement on the campaign trail.    the democratic nominee has laid out two specific steps for bring change within law enforecment. the first would be to call on law enforcement and communities to "develop national guidelines on the use of force by police officers," clinton said in a speech about her plan on july 8, 2016, the day after five police officers were ambushed and killed during a peaceful black lives matter protest in dallas. the protest was held in the wake of fatal police shootings of alton sterling in baton rouge and philando castile in minnesota. "we’ll make it clear for everyone to see when deadly force is warranted, and when it isn’t," clinton said in her speech, which was before the general conference of the african methodist episcopal church in philadelphia. the second step would be to "acknowledge that implicit bias still exists across our society and even in the best police departments" and commit $1 billion to fund new training programs and support research, she said. "we do need police and criminal justice reforms, to save lives and make sure all americans are treated equally in rights and dignity," clinton said in the speech, her most extensive talk yet on the issue of policing. "we do need to support police departments and stand up for the men and women who put their lives on the line every day to protect us. we do need to reduce gun violence. we may disagree about how to go about these things, but surely we can all agree with those basic premises. her plan specifically focuses on "reducing excessive violence, reforming our sentencing laws, supporting police departments that are doing things right, and making it harder for the wrong people to get their hands on guns," she said. clinton had also previously spoken about the need to end racial profiling. in october, her team noted that she plans to support legislation banning racial profiling on federal, state and law enforcement levels. she co-sponsored similar acts while she was in the senate.    the republican nominee, unlike clinton, has given no speeches that specifically focus on his plans regarding law enforcement tactics. instead, the self-anointed "law-and-order candidate" has made passing remarks on several law enforcement topics at different times. he has said that police need "better training," as evidenced by certain shootings. "even when they wear cameras police wear the cameras you need training. you have to have training. you have to have better training obviously than what they have," he said during an interview with the impact network in september. most recently, trump said controversial "stop-and-frisk" practices that were previously used in new york city would be a way to end violence in the black community. the morning after mentioning this during a town hall with voters in cleveland on sept. 21, trump said he didn't mean stop-and-frisk should be implemented nationally, but only in chicago because "chicago is out of control." trump has also mentioned that mosques should be under surveillance, though he has wavered on the topic. he has also suggested that old military gear should be handed over to police departments, but did not go into detail. in the wake of the bombings last weekend in new york city and new jersey, trump said police should be allowed to profile, though his son donald trump jr. later took issue with it being called "racial profiling." "they see somebody that's suspicious, they will profile," the candidate said on fox news on monday. "look what's going on: do we really have a choice? we're trying to be so politically correct in our country, and this is only going to get worse." abc news' liz kreutz, josh haskell, john santucci and candace smith contributed to this report.      trump, clinton differ on policing      
__label__0 president obama today vetoed a bill that would allow survivors of the 9/11 attacks, along with victims' families, to sue the government of saudi arabia. “i am returning herewith without my approval s. 2040, the ‘justice against sponsors of terrorism act’ (jasta), which would, among other things, remove sovereign immunity in u.s. courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism,” obama notes in the veto message. “i have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001 (9/11), who have suffered grievously. i also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.” the veto comes at the end of a 10-day constitutional window after congress' overwhelming approval of the legislation, setting up a fight that's likely to hand the outgoing president his first veto override. suffering his first veto override so late in his second term would be significant, especially considering the president's high approval ratings relative to the rest of his presidency. by comparison, former president george w. bush was overridden twice during his two terms in office and only in his final two years when his approval rating had plummeted. the last president to make it through a full presidency without a veto override is lyndon b. johnson.       if passed into law, the legislation would allow victims of terrorism to sue foreign governments for damages. obama and the white house have argued that language in the bill could potentially compromise the principle of “sovereign immunity,” and put the u.s. government and entities at risk of being sued by other countries. "overriding the president's veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism and potentially opens up u.s. service members and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world," white house press secretary josh earnest explained to reporters today. "our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with saudi arabia, but rather the impact that this could have on the united states' relationship with countries around the world." but the showdown has also put the obama administration at odds politically with the wishes of countless 9/11 families who argue they haven't had their day in court against all parties responsible for the terror attacks. saudi arabia has itself spoken critically of and personally lobbied against the effort, maintaining it had no role in assisting the 9/11 terrorists. the house and senate each passed the measure by unanimous consent. a veto override requires a two-thirds vote by each chamber, and the white house says it has been working diligently behind the scenes to rally enough democrats to block the override effort. obama's former secretary of state, hillary clinton, has also indicated she would sign the legislation into law if she wins the presidential election.      president obama vetoes 9/11 victims bill, setting up showdown with congress      
__label__0 when hillary clinton and donald trump take the debate stage at hofstra university on long island in new york tonight for the highly anticipated first presidential debate of the general election, gary johnson will be watching on television some 30 miles away in twitter's chelsea office in manhattan — armed only with a twitter handle. the campaign for the libertarian party nominee is hoping to interject his voice into the debate from the sidelines through an aggressive twitter and media strategy. both johnson and his running mate, former massachusetts gov. bill weld, will be live-tweeting throughout the evening. "govs. johnson and weld will be making themselves available to the media, watching the debate with great interest, and will be anxious to point out how a third voice, representing millions of independent voters disenfranchised by the republican and democrat parties, would better serve the american people," campaign communications director joe hunter told abc news in a statement. he added, "they will be respectful and not interested in any grandstanding for the cameras or inappropriate 'protests.'" green party candidate jill stein will be challenging her exclusion from the debate by holding a rally outside the secured perimeter of the debate hall. however, her campaign says she will not "risk arrest," given that there is an active warrant for her arrest because of her involvement in a recent protest against a controversial pipeline project in north dakota. in 2012, she and her running mate were arrested outside hofstra university when they attempted to enter the grounds during a presidential debate between president barack obama and then–republican nominee mitt romney. instead, she plans to be live on periscope during the debate, answering the same questions that are lobbed at clinton and trump on the debate stage. johnson failed to qualify for the first presidential debate after he fell short of the 15 percent polling threshold for for inclusion set by the commission on presidential debates. his recent national polling average stands at 9 percent, with the most recent abc news/washington post poll published over the weekend putting him at 5 percent. although he previously said it would be "game over" for his campaign if he failed to qualify for the debates, he now says that it is "an ongoing process" to try to reach the 15 percent threshold for subsequent debates this fall. in an interview on abc news' "this week" on sunday, johnson criticized the commission on presidential debates over its formula for deciding who is included in the debates, saying that the panel is "made up of republicans and democrats that just have no intention whatsoever in seeing anyone other than a republican or democrat on the debate stage." johnson's campaign is touting an online petition that has garnered over 1 million signatures in support of johnson's inclusion in the debates. abc news' maryalice parks contributed reporting.       what gary johnson will be up to when hillary clinton and donald trump take the debate stage      
__label__0 while the biggest attraction during the presidential debate tonight will be the two candidates on stage, at least some attention will likely be paid to those in the audience. here's a look at who the candidates invited to sit in the audience at tonight's debate.  hillary clinton's campaign this morning released a partial list of guests invited by the democratic presidential nominee to the debate at hofstra university in new york. the four women on the list are all supporters who have developed a special relationship with clinton over the years. they include a 9/11 survivor; a single mom and domestic abuse survivor; and a woman who became a pen pal to clinton when she was the first lady. the list also includes anastasia somoza -- a woman with cerebral palsy who was recently featured in a campaign attack ad about donald trump's mocking of a disabled reporter.       most notably, the clinton campaign has also given dallas mavericks owner and trump antagonist mark cuban a front-row ticket for the show. chelsea clinton is also expected to attend, according to a spokeswoman for the former first daughter. and, the clinton camp said this morning it is hosting 1,200 debate-watch parties across all 50 states tonight. clinton's running mate tim kaine will attend a watch party in orlando, florida, organized by the human rights campaign. former congresswoman gabby giffords and her husband, astronaut mark kelly, will also attend that event, an aide said.  this morning, reports emerged that the republican nominee invited mark geist, one of the survivors of the attack on the u.s. consulate in benghazi, libya, to attend the debate. geist has been vocal in his support of trump's candidacy; he spoke on the first night of the republican national convention alongside fellow security contractor john tiegen about the attack in benghazi. trump also over the weekend fired off a tweet about a possible guest to the debate. after mark cuban posted about his plans to attend the event in support of clinton, trump tweeted saturday: “if dopey mark cuban of failed benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps i will put gennifer flowers right alongside of him!”  if dopey mark cuban of failed benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps i will put gennifer flowers right alongside of him!  bill clinton admitted in the 1990s to having had a sexual relationship with flowers two decades earlier. on sunday morning, trump campaign manager kellyanne conway told abc's "this week" that flowers, "has not been invited by the campaign." however, the clinton camp used trump's tweet to accuse the republican nominee of acting unpresidential. "he's a reality tv star. he’s very experienced at providing television entertainment. the presidency is not about entertainment. it’s about serious decisions," clinton's campaign manager robby mook told abc news’ george stephanopoulos sunday. abc news' jessica hopper contributed to this report.      who hillary clinton and donald trump invited to the first presidential debate      
__label__0 cities across the country suffered an uptick in violent crime last year, including a nearly 11 percent jump in murders from the year before, according to new statistics compiled by the fbi. there were 1,197,704 violent crimes committed around the nation last year -- a 3.9 percent increase from 2014, according to the fbi's uniform crime report. however, last year's statistics were still slightly lower than in 2011, and more than 16 percent below the 2006 level, the fbi said today. it's important to note that big jumps in violent crime in only a handful of u.s. cities can drive the national average up. some cities, like chicago and los angeles, saw more than 24,000 violent crimes each last year, while so many other cities and towns across the country experienced single-digit or no violent crimes at all. overall, murders accounted for nearly 15,700 of last year's violent crimes, and nearly three-quarters of them were committed with firearms, according to the fbi report.     "the report shows that there was an overall increase in violent crime last year, making clear what each of us already knows: that we still have so much work to do," attorney general loretta lynch said at a violent-reduction summit in little rock, arkansas. "but the report also reminds us of the progress that we are making. it shows that in many communities, crime has remained stable or even decreased from the historic lows reported in 2014. and it is important to remember that while crime did increase overall last year, 2015 still represented the third-lowest year for violent crime in the past two decades." lynch said the nation must not become "complacent" about violent crime. "the residents of communities where violence remains a fact of daily life care little whether overall crime rates are up and down," she said. "and in the raft of data and analysis that can so often define our work, we must never forget that all of our numbers reflect the lives of real people." she emphasized that "there is no single cause of violence, and solutions will vary from one community to another."      violent crime up as city homicides spur 11% hike in total murders for 2015      
__label__0 as millions of voters tune in to watch the first presidential debate of the 2016 campaign, there are several key issues to keep in mind. the general election has been playing out for about two months now, with donald trump and hillary clinton taking direct aim at each other, but tonight will be the first time that they square off directly. watch the first presidential debate on abc news and abcnews.com at 9 p.m. eastern time. on monday.    clinton has been preparing for her 35th presidential election debate for weeks. aides say the former secretary of state — who is known for doing her homework — has been poring over briefing books and practicing in mock debates with a trump stand-in, clinton's longtime aide philippe reines. she has said she expects it to be a "difficult, challenging" debate. her campaign has even consulted with "the art of the deal" ghostwriter tony schwartz on how to beat him in a debate. trump was in debate prep meetings all day friday after focusing more on campaigning than studying up for the showdown. though no mock debates occurred, he was asked rounds of questions he could face from tonight's moderator. the sessions were led by trump surrogate and former new york city mayor rudy giuliani, along with the campaign leadership.    acknowledging that there are concerns about his tone, trump has repeatedly said that he plans to be polite — but only to a point. "i'm going to be very respectful of her," trump said during a interview on fox news on thursday. "i think she deserves that, and i'm going to be nice. and if she's respectful of me, that’ll be nice. we'll have something that i think people will respect as a debate, but we'll see where it all goes. you really never know exactly how it's going to turn out, and that's why we're going to have a lot of people watching," he said. for her part, clinton and her team have spoken about how they had to prep by facing off against two versions of trump: the more professional, contained version that has been present on the trail more recently and the more bombastic, uncontrolled version that was seen more during the primaries.  chelsea clinton will attend the debate, a first for her this election cycle, after not attending any of the democratic primary debates. and another familiar face is expected to be in the front row supporting team clinton: mark cuban. the billionaire dallas mavericks owner is a vocal clinton supporter and reportedly went so far as to volunteer to play trump in her mock debates. he said earlier this week that the clinton team never returned his email offer, but they did keep him in mind for another move.  just got a front row seat to watch @hillaryclinton overwhelm @realdonaldtrump at the "humbling at hofstra" on monday. it is on !  if cuban is being put in the front row as some kind of psychological ploy, the television audience shouldn't expect to enjoy his presence. peter eyre, a senior adviser with the commission on presidential debates, the independent organization that sponsors the events, told abc news that the live audience will not be on camera during the debate at hofstra university tonight. there are expected to be about 1,000 people in the audience.    lester holt from nbc's "nightly news" has been tasked with moderating tonight's debate, and he's under some pressure. nbc hosted the recent commander in chief forum, during which both candidates fielded questions about their plans for the military, and holt's colleague matt lauer was widely criticized for his performance. critics complained that he focused more on clinton's email scandal than anything to do with the military and that he let trump make claims that were false without any intervention. the question of how much fact-checking moderators should do during the debates has been raised. trump has said that he does not believe the moderators should intervene to fact-check, and clinton raised money off lauer's lack of fact-checking after the forum, indicating that she would be in favor of moderators' playing a role.  it's estimated that tens of millions of people will watch the debate in real time, and many more will be influenced by the social media spin in the aftermath, when the debate about the debate takes place online. clinton's campaign is well aware that the outcome of the debate depends not just on what the two candidates say onstage but also on the conversation that takes place around it. on a conference call with supporters on friday, a top aide to clinton directly asked their supporters to use social media during and after the debate to help shape the conversation positively around the democratic nominee. the campaign's digital director, jenna lowenstein, said two of the campaign's goals for the night are to amplify clinton's best moments online and to influence the narrative about who is winning. "it's important that we're not just turning this into the donald trump show," lowenstein said. she instructed, "tweet early, tweet her name, use those hashtags." watch the first presidential debate monday at 9 p.m. et. full live coverage and analysis of the debate will begin on abcnews.com/live at 7 p.m. et.      5 storylines to watch during tonight's presidential debate      
__label__0 eastern aleppo saw what witnesses describe as an unprecedented and relentless offensive as united nations diplomats demanded a halt to the violence sunday. this morning airstrikes continued to hit the rebel-held part of aleppo, say locals. “six have died at the hospital so far since airstrikes started to hit this morning,” abu rajab, a radiologist and managing director of an aleppo hospital, told abc news. sunday's airstrikes were heavier than anything he had seen or heard since the syrian war started over five years ago, he said. “it felt as if the ground was shaking under you, like an earthquake,” he said of the strikes. “the explosions sounded loud and strange, like nothing we’ve heard before in five years of war. it was a bloody day. no words can describe what happened yesterday.”   he said the hospital received about 180 injured people from sunday's attacks and had to refer some of them to other clinics because it didn’t have the capacity to treat all of them. about 40 percent of the wounded were children, and 20 percent were women, he said. the intensive care unit was so filled up with patients that one surgeon had to conduct an operation on a floor. since midnight saturday, at least 27 people were killed by strikes from warplanes and government helicopters, the syrian observatory for human rights said sunday. at least 70 people have been killed in airstrikes on eastern aleppo from friday to sunday night, activists in syria told abc news. the united nations said the recent attacks on aleppo could amount to war crimes.    “repeated airstrikes and the use of bunker-busting and incendiary bombs in densely populated areas could well prove to be war crimes,” david swanson, a spokesman for the u.n. office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, told abc news. the u.n. has 40 trucks with aid ready to enter eastern aleppo. the aid has been sitting by the turkey-syria border for about two weeks and is still waiting at a syrian customs area. once the u.n. gets the green light, the first convoy carrying a month's worth of wheat flour for more than 150,000 people will be sent to aleppo, according to the u.n.’s office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs. the shipment will be followed up by a delivery of enough food rations to feed 35,000 people for a month. the distance from the border to eastern aleppo is only some 40 miles, but the journey could take about four to five hours. while up to 275,000 people in eastern aleppo are still waiting for the aid they need, humanitarian assistance entered the four besieged syrian towns of madaya, foah, zabadani and kefraya on sunday.    on wednesday evening, one of two water pumping stations in eastern aleppo was destroyed by airstrikes. in retaliation, rebels turned off the second water pumping station, which mainly serves the government-held western part of the city. that means that close to 2 million people in aleppo are living without running water. at an emergency meeting sunday, western u.n. diplomats condemned the recent escalating violence in aleppo and blamed russia and the syrian government. samantha powers, the u.s. ambassador to the u.n., accused russia of committing barbarism under the guise of counterterrorism. “instead of pursuing peace, russia and [syrian president bashar al-]assad make war. instead of helping get lifesaving aid to civilians, russia and assad are bombing humanitarian convoys, hospitals and first responders who are trying desperately to keep people alive,” powers told members of the security council sunday. “it seems the only items that make it into eastern aleppo these days are barrel bombs and incendiaries that witnesses report seen dropped by assad's forces and russian forces. russia, of course, has long had the power to stop this suffering. even now, we will continue to look for any way possible to restore the cessation of hostilities.” powers walked out of the emergency session along with the french and u.k. ambassadors to the u.n. in protest when syria’s ambassador was called to speak. the u.s., the u.k. and france requested the emergency meeting after the syrian military on thursday announced a new offensive on eastern aleppo.      aleppo sees unprecedented day of airstrikes as un condemns violence      
__label__0 almost 20 percent of americans surveyed said they could change their mind about the presidential election based on tonight’s face-off between donald trump and hillary clinton, according to the latest abc news/washington poll. in fact, 6 percent of americans said there’s a “good chance” that tonight could swing their vote one way or another — more than the margin between the two candidates in most national polls over the last month. here are the groups to watch for during tonight’s debate: 1. young voters. almost 3 in 10 young voters (28 percent) polled said they could switch their vote based on tonight’s face-off between clinton and trump. a broad 60 percent of these voters went for president barack obama in 2012, but many are threatening to vote for third-party candidates gary johnson or jill stein this year. 2. people who don’t like either candidate. a good number of americans surveyed who said they don’t like either major party candidate said they could change their minds tonight. twenty-seven percent of americans who have an unfavorable view of both clinton and trump said they could change their minds, versus only 13 percent of those who like at least one of them. 3. bernie sanders supporters. a quarter of americans polled who backed the vermont senator during the democratic primaries (26 percent) said they might flip candidates based on tonight’s debate. only 74 percent of them said they’re voting for clinton, with 9 percent going for trump and 12 percent split between johnson and stein. 4. independents. a quarter of americans (24 percent) surveyed who are not affiliated with either political party said their votes could be up in the air during tonight’s debate. trump has a statistically insignificant advantage among this group, 43 percent to clinton’s 38 percent, with 10 percent going for johnson and 2 percent for stein. 5. people who are on the fence about voting. people who might not show up to the polls are also more likely to consider switching their votes. only 11 percent of americans polled who have followed the race “very closely” and 14 percent of those who were “absolutely certain” they will vote said they could change their minds. that’s compared with 24 percent and 25 percent of those who have followed the race less closely and were less certain to vote, respectively. 6. unenthusiastic voters. respondents who were “very enthusiastic” about voting for clinton and trump were largely set in stone: only 9 percent of “very enthusiastic” clinton backers and 3 percent of “very enthusiastic” trump supporters said they could change their minds. that’s compared with 22 percent of less enthusiastic clinton backers and 18 percent of less enthusiastic trump supporters. 7. weaker partisans and ideologues. very strong partisans were less likely to be open to changing their votes tonight: just 10 percent of strong conservatives, 12 percent of liberal democrats and 6 percent of conservative republicans said the debates could change their votes. white men without a college degree (13 percent) and people who make $100,000 per year or more (11 percent) were also less likely to be open to a flip tonight. poll results come from an abc news/washington post poll released on sept. 25. the survey was conducted by landline and cellular telephones sept. 19 to 22, 2016, in english and spanish, among a random national sample of 1,001 adults, including 651 likely voters. results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points, including the design effect, for the full sample and 4.5 points for likely voters.      the voters most likely to change their minds after tonight's debate

"i don't think he's got the skill set," he said about trump. "let's put it this way, if he came on 'shark tank,' i wouldn't make the investment. i just don't see him as being capable in the least bit." trump quickly responded to the news by tweeting that he was considering inviting gennifer flowers, the variety show performer who famously had an affair with bill clinton before he became president.  if dopey mark cuban of failed benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps i will put gennifer flowers right alongside of him!  although trump's campaign manager told abc news' george stephanopoulos that trump did not actually invite flowers, it seems she was willing to accept the invitation.  hi donald. you know i'm in your corner and will definitely be at the debate!...??      meanwhile, other celebrities are gearing up to watch the first debate between the two candidates. here's what they are saying on social media:  ready for #mudslingmonday #yougotthishrc pic.twitter.com/0lbxpnukdd   may angels stand guard at the debate tonight. sending love, blessing, protection, hope...   my goal in life is to refrain from tweeting during debate. as the kiddies say #lifegoals   i feel like something big is going to happen tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/oiy0ncxirb   1. will u be watching the debate tomorrow? 2. will you be watching with an open mind or is your mind made up? 3. what snack will u b having?   why would they schedule a debate on a monday night football night?? guess it makes sense to somebody.   for the debates on monday, i'm thinking of serving skewers. with cheetos and skittles for munchies, of course.   to level the field at the debates tonight, hillary clinton will be administered anesthesia, and all questions will be read to her in german.   can not wait to watch the trump - clinton debate,this monday..i'm betting that the shorter of the two blonds will prevail..   only 50 more days til we find out who's our next president! last time i was nauseous 50 days straight, at least i got a baby out of it!       stars comment on social media before tonight's presidential debate      
__label__0 police escorted green party presidential nominee jill stein off hofstra university’s campus this afternoon before tonight’s first presidential debate. authorities encountered stein on the college campus in hempstead, new york, and asked the third-party candidate, who has not garnered enough support to participate in the debates, to show the proper credentials, which she could not do, police said. she was “nicely escorted” off the grounds around 2:30 p.m. eastern time, a nassau county police department spokesman told abc news. stein tweeted about the incident, saying she was on the campus “doing an interview” when police put her and her team “in a van” and escorted them off the school’s grounds. earlier, stein’s campaign said she obtained a credential to go in and do interviews at the media filing center in the early afternoon.  after being escorted from hofstra campus for doing an interview, police put us in a van which was stopped not once, but twice. #debatenight pic.twitter.com/igqjmocnwz  stein had planned to challenge her exclusion from tonight’s event by hosting a rally outside the secured perimeter of the debate hall beginning, around 5 p.m. eastern time. she said she will be live on twitter’s periscope app answering the same questions as democratic nominee hillary clinton and republican nominee donald trump on the debate stage. stein’s campaign said she will not “risk arrest” this time, because there is an outstanding warrant for her arrest over her involvement in a recent protest against a controversial pipeline project in north dakota. still, her campaign spokeswoman meleiza figueroa said they will attempt to get the “spirited demonstration … as close to the gates as possible." in 2012, stein and her running mate were arrested outside hofstra university when they tried entering the premises during a presidential debate between president barack obama and then–republican nominee mitt romney. abc news’ maryalice parks and jordyn phelps contributed to this report      3rd-party candidate jill stein escorted from hofstra by police before presidential debate      
__label__0 for the first time in president obama’s tenure, the senate is set to override his veto of a bill that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue saudi arabia in u.s. courts. the president vetoed the bill friday, citing concerns that it could open the u.s. government to similar lawsuits. "our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with saudi arabia, but rather the impact that this could have on the united states' relationship with countries around the world,” white house press secretary josh earnest told reporters friday. the white house is also concerned that the bill could tarnish the u.s. relationship with the gulf nation. saudi arabia has itself spoken critically of and personally lobbied against the effort, maintaining it had no role in assisting the 9/11 terrorists. but the bill passed with unanimous voice votes in both the house of representatives and the senate, meaning the veto override, set for a senate vote wednesday and house vote by friday, will likely get the two-thirds majority in both chambers needed to pass. “i look forward to the opportunity for congress to override the president’s veto, provide these families with the chance to seek the justice they deserve, and send a clear message that we will not tolerate those who finance terrorism in the united states,” senate majority whip john cornyn, r-texas, said in a statement friday. former secretary of state hillary clinton has also indicated she would sign the legislation into law if she wins the presidential election.      congress expected to override obama 9/11 bill veto      
__label__0 washington (cnn)donald trump was asked by a member of a fox news town hall audience this week what he would do to reduce violent crime in the country's inner cities. "right, well, one of the things i'd do, ricardo, is i would do 'stop-and-frisk.' i think you have to. we did it in new york, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically. you understand; you have to, in my opinion. i see what's going on here. i see what's going on in chicago; i think stop-and-frisk, in new york city, it was so incredible, the way it worked." stop-and-frisk is a type of aggressive policing that allows -- some say encourages -- officers to detain a person on virtually any type of vague suspicion, search that individual without a warrant and arrest the person if any kind of illegal substance or weapon is found. it grew out of the tough policies of new york mayor rudy giuliani, now a vocal trump supporter and trusted adviser, under the theory that aggressive enforcement of even minor laws would lead to a reduction of violent crime. proponents of stop-and-frisk argue that it would be especially effective in getting illegal guns off the streets. critics of the program questioned its constitutionality. they also pointed to the fact, documented in several studies, that the policy falls heaviest on black and latino men. but is trump right that stop-and-frisk "worked incredibly well?" it is clear that crime rates plunged in new york during giuliani's time in office, as well as the terms of his successor, michael bloomberg, who ramped up the stop-and-frisk program. what's less clear is the policy's impact on the lower crime rate. the number of stops in the city rose dramatically from 97,296 in 2002 to 685,724 in 2011, a seven-fold increase, according to data compiled by the new york civil liberties union based on police reports. but the number of homicides did not fall in proportion to the soaring number of stops, dropping from 587 in 2002 to 515 in 2011. moreover, the nyclu also found that in the more than 5 million stops between 2002 and 2013, guns were found in only 0.2% of the cases. other violent crimes also fell during this time period. assaults were down 13%, robberies declined 27% and rape declined 35%, according to city-data.com. but none of these drops came close to corresponding with the huge increase in stop-and-frisk cases. new york's stop-and-frisk policy was found to be unconstitutional by a federal judge in 2013 and current mayor bill de blasio vowed to end it in 2014. the newly elected mayor dropped the city's appeal of that decision. that decision elicited cries from some proponents that it would lead to a surge in violent crime. however, except for an uptick in 2015, the city's homicide rate continued its downward trend, reaching historic lows in the first quarter of 2016.       reality check: was 'stop-and-frisk' effective?      
__label__0 pittsburgh (cnn)donald trump called thursday for a "national anti-crime agenda" to combat violent crime in us cities as he condemned the unrest that unfolded overnight in charlotte, north carolina, where protests turned violent. "our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world's leader. how can we lead when we can't even control our own cities," trump said during a speech here to a conference of shale oil and natural gas producers. after police shot a man officials say was armed, two nights of protests followed there, slipping into violence wednesday night with numerous civilian and police injuries reported, as well as looting and property destruction. trump, who has focused on restoring "law and order" in his presidential campaign, seized on the unrest in charlotte to renew his call for tough-on-crime policies to bring down crime rates in major american cities and once again appeal to african-americans to join his campaign. "the people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding african-american residents who live in these communities where crime is so rampant," trump said. "there is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a trump administration, ever, ever." related: clinton, trump navigate politics of police violence trump also tied the eruption of violent protests on wednesday night to drugs, saying in pittsburgh that "drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night" -- though he offered no evidence to back up that claim. steven cheung, a trump campaign spokesman, later said it was "obvious" trump was "referring to the recent increase in drug related deaths and subsequent news reports, thus making it a hot button issue." praised stop-and-frisk trump praised the policing practiced under former new york city mayor rudy giuliani, which included the use of "stop-and-frisk" and a greater crackdown on misdemeanor offenses and has been credited with helping bring down the city's crime rate during the 1990s. "think of how many families these policies saved from the worst heartache possible," trump said of giuliani, who is now a top adviser and surrogate. speaking to fox news a day earlier, trump spoke out in favor of the controversial stop-and-frisk policy giuliani put in place in new york which was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge in 2013 for being a "policy of indirect racial profiling." trump said thursday morning that he was calling for that policy to be implemented in chicago, where gun violence has skyrocketed, with more than 3,000 people shot in that city so far this year. related: new york mayor: donald trump wrong about 'stop-and-frisk' during that interview, trump also highlighted what he saw as a "lack of spirit" between communities. "it just seems that there's a lack of spirit between the white and the black. i mean, it's a terrible thing that we're witnessing," he said. trump offered few details in his pittsburgh speech of what would be included in his "national anti-crime agenda to make our cities safe again," beyond saying that he will "make reduction of crime a top priority" and appoint "the best" prosecutors and federal investigators to go after criminal gangs and cartels. trump has previously said that he would look to increase the number of police officers in inner cities to bring down the crime rate and improve training, but has offered little other specifics on this policy front. "safety is the foundation of the ladder to american success," he said. asked wednesday about the police shootings in charlotte and tulsa, oklahoma, that have reignited the debate over race and policing in the country, trump did not address the charlotte incident but said he was "very, very troubled" by the shooting of terence crutcher, an unarmed black man, in tulsa on friday night. trump suggested the police officer who fatally shot crutcher "got scared" or "was choking," referring to individuals who fail under pressure. cnn's ashley killough contributed to this report.      trump calls for 'national anti-crime agenda' after charlotte unrest      
__label__0 (cnn)a trail of clues provided by a washington post reporter and his readers led univision anchor enrique acevedo to donald trump's shimmering golf resort outside miami earlier this week. there, acevedo found something that has elicited both shock and mystery within the political world: a portrait of trump that the republican nominee reportedly paid for using money from his charitable foundation. "a lot of people have been looking for this painting," acevedo wrote wednesday. the search was prompted by david fahrenthold, the washington post reporter who has been investigating the trump foundation. in a story published tuesday, fahrenthold reported that the real estate mogul had used money from the trump foundation to purchase a $10,000, four-foot-tall acrylic painting of himself at a charity fundraiser. fahrenthold had already reported that trump used the foundation's money to buy another portrait of himself, one that was six-feet-tall and cost $20,000. experts say each purchase was possibly illegal. the trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. following the report tuesday, an eagle-eyed twitter follower notified fahrenthold that a photo on tripadvisor showed the portrait hanging at the trump national doral resort near miami. the resort happens to be mere blocks from univision's studios. acevedo, who said he's been following fahrenthold's reporting for weeks, reserved a room late tuesday night at the hotel using points from his personal credit card. "i didn't want to give univision's money to one of trump's businesses," he said. acevedo eventually located the painting at the entrance of the champions bar & grill insider the resort, marking the latest triumph in fahrenthold's intrepid and collaborative reporting. "i consider it a very small contribution to david's phenomenal reporting," acevedo told cnn in an email. fahrenthold, for his part, disagrees. "enrique deserves 99.9 percent of the credit for that find, since it was he who figured out how to get on the property (by booking a room), and then how to find the photo itself," he told cnn in an email. fahrenthold's reporting was cited in a speech last week by president barack obama, who compared the clinton family foundation with trump's foundation. "one candidate's family foundation has saved countless lives around the world," obama said. "the other candidate's foundation took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself." when he learned of the president's comment, fahrenthold put in another request to his readers. "reminder," he tweeted, "i am still looking for this portrait." the next day, he had a lead from a washington post reader who had shipped the painting to another one of trump's golf clubs in briarcliff manor, new york. "this all happened because of social media," fahrenthold told cnn in the email, saying he hoped the tripadvisor photo would motivate a florida reporter to track it down. "enrique did just that -- although, it turns out, i had underestimated how much work this would actually take," he said.       univision anchor locates controversial trump portrait      
__label__0 (cnn)investigators have now pieced together a detailed timeline of ahmad rahami's movements from the time when they say he left bombs in seaside park, new jersey to his capture in linden two days later, law enforcement sources tell cnn. based on the new information, investigators now believe rahami went back to his family's elizabeth, new jersey home after the chelsea bombings and was seen there by his family. in law enforcement interviews with family members, rahami was described as behaving normally. according to the officials, his return home appears to be in a time period before rahami was publicly identified as a suspect in the bombings. the federal complaint filed against rahami describes how he came to manhattan about two hours before the first blast on west 23rd street in chelsea, but does not explain a three-hour gap from then to when he is believed to have left the city via the lincoln tunnel at approximately 11:30 p.m., around the same time the nypd and new york city mayor were hold their first news conference regarding the nights' terror. related: ahmad khan rahami: what we know about the bombing suspect investigators have been aided both by surveillance footage as well as tracking of his phone, which had no cellular service but used available wi-fi. while a timeline has been created, investigators are still not clear where rahami allegedly built the bombs he used, according the multiple sources. but one source familiar with the investigation remarked that the bombs reflected a skilled hand at assembly. rahami himself remains in the hospital. in a federal court filing thursday, lawyers from the us attorney's office in new jersey wrote that they've been informed by rahami's medical team that "he is currently incapacitated and intubated. as such, he is not in sufficient physical health for presentment to the court -- even at a bedside proceeding." while investigators have talked to the family, they are still seeking more information on what, if anything, they knew about rahami's intentions. according to law enforcement sources, it was the cell phone of rahami's younger sister that contained the video of him "lighting the fuse" of a partially buried cylindrical object, followed by "a loud noise and flames, followed by billowing smoke." the complaint alleges that event took place two days before the bombings and describes how laughter is heard on the video before rahami returns into the frame and is seen picking up the object. so far, investigators have no information to suggest the sister knew of rahami's plans. related: where did ahmad khan rahami travel? rahami's wife has returned to the us after talking with the fbi in dubai, according to law enforcement officials. she told investigators in dubai that she had no knowledge of her husband's activities and is expected to talk more with the fbi now that she is back in the us. sources tell cnn that it now appears that she left in june and a previously booked ticket to return this week.       investigators: ahmad rahami went to family home after chelsea bombing      
__label__0 washington (cnn)prosecutors in the office of us attorney preet bharara have issued a subpoena for anthony weiner's cell phone and other records, according to law enforcement officials. the fbi and the new york police department have opened preliminary investigations of allegations that the former new york democratic congressman exchanged sexually explicit text messages with a purportedly underage girl. spokespersons for the us attorney's office in manhattan and the fbi declined to comment. the allegations first surfaced in the daily mail. the online sexting relationship allegedly went on for months between weiner and a girl claiming to be just 15. the daily mail reported she said he sent her numerous photos, one of him in a pool and at least one bare-chested. the outlet reported that the girl said she reached out to weiner in january on twitter. in a statement to cnn, weiner neither confirmed or denied sending the texts. "i have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgment about the people i have communicated with online and the things i have sent. i am filled with regret and heartbroken for those i have hurt," he said. weiner continued: "while i have provided the daily mail with information showing that i have likely been the subject of a hoax, i have no one to blame but me for putting myself in this position. i am sorry." cnn has not been able to confirm this was a hoax. in a statement, a spokeswoman for republican presidential nominee donald trump noted that weiner donated $550 to hillary clinton's presidential campaign last year. "the announcement by the fbi and new york police department that they are investigating close clinton ally anthony weiner's inappropriate relationship with an underaged female is extremely disturbing," jessica ditto said. "the clinton campaign should immediately return all campaign contributions from weiner. america has had enough of the sleaze that is clinton, inc." huma abedin, one of clinton's closest aides, announced last month that she was separating from weiner after photos emerged of him allegedly sexting with another woman while their son was in bed with him. that woman was described in the new york post as a 40-something divorced woman from the west. weiner left congress in june 2011 when sexually-charged, sometimes explicit, texts with women other than his wife first emerged. his social media habits continued after leaving congress and contributed to his poor showing in the 2013 new york city mayoral race, a contest in which he had once been a leading contender. cnn's sonia moghe contributed to this report.      first on cnn: us attorney investigating weiner sexting allegations      
__label__0 (cnn)congressional black caucus members demanded that the justice department "aggressively pursue investigations, indictments and prosecutions" regarding the recent deaths of two black men, which stemmed from fatal police shootings. "we come to you today to urge you to aggressively pursue investigations, indictments and prosecutions through the office of civil rights against any and all law enforcement officers who harm or kill innocent unarmed black men, women and children," said rep. maxine waters, d-california, reading excerpts from a letter members later presented to attorney general loretta lynch decrying violence. "we will not continue to ask our constituents to be patient without any hope for change," she added. "madame attorney general, you have the unique opportunity and constitutional responsibility to change this narrative." caucus chair g. k. butterfield said the incidents this week are not isolated. "the congressional black caucus is outraged with the dozens of unlawful police shootings that are taking place all across america involving unarmed, innocent african-american citizens," butterfield told reporters. "if we were to identify each of these, it would consume this entire press conference," the north carolina democrat added. multiple members of the group, which includes dozens of african-american members of congress, have spoken out following the death of terence crutcher, who was shot and killed last week in tulsa, oklahoma, after his car broke down. the 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before officer betty shelby fatally shot him. crutcher was unarmed at the time. "he posed no threat. he had no weapon. and yet he was confronted by the tulsa police department and he was both tasered and shot to death," said new jersey rep. bonnie watson coleman in a video posted on the caucus' page. "this is disgusting. and i am angry and i am hurt." in a news conference thursday, lynch expressed sorrow about the ongoing conflicts between law enforcement and people of color. "one of my top priorities as attorney general has been to do everything in my power to help heal those divides. and the department of justice will continue working tirelessly to protect the rights of all americans," she said. "we have come together with thoughts and prayers far too many times for victims of violence -- civilians and law enforcement alike," she added. multiple police officers and citizens have been injured this week during protests after the fatal shooting of keith lamont scott by a police officer. police say scott was armed at the time he was fatally shot, but his family claims that he was reading a book in his vehicle when police officers approached and shot him. charlotte-mecklenburg police chief kerr putney said thursday that the department would not be releasing a video of the encounter between scott and law enforcement. rep. joyce beatty told cnn's john berman that lawmakers "can't be silent." "i think transparency is of the utmost. i understand the legalities. i understand that you have to have a full investigation," she said on "at this hour." "we want to make sure that the us department of justice is engaged. we want to have independent investigators going into these communities so we take away all doubt or perceptions of the biases," the ohio democrat said. "we're losing too many lives." both presidential candidates have spoken out this week about the need to improve the relationship between black communities and law enforcement. hillary clinton, who the black caucus' political action committee endorsed, addressed the shootings in a speech wednesday in orlando, florida. "there is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. but we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of african-americans killed by police officers in these encounters," clinton said. "it's unbearable. and it needs to become intolerable." and donald trump said wednesday he was "very troubled" by the fatal police shooting in tulsa and suggested the officer in question "got scared" or was "choking," a slang term for failing under pressure.       congressional black caucus asks doj to take action after police shootings      
__label__0 washington (cnn)a spokesman for the state department acknowledged in a recent interview there's "potential" for isis terrorists to infiltrate refugee camps in the middle east, but stood by the rigor of us vetting standards for refugees. "i wouldn't debate the fact that there's the potential for isis terrorists to try to insert themselves," john kirby said on "fox and friends" wednesday. "and we've seen that in some of the refugee camps in jordan and in turkey where they'll try to insert themselves into the population." the acknowledgment comes amid criticism the obama administration's refugee resettlement policy poses security risks to the us, a charge made often by republican presidential nominee donald trump on the campaign trail. "is it perfect?" kirby asked of the vetting process. "can it be perfect? can it be foolproof? well, probably not. no. but it is very, very serious." "i can tell you that the vetting is tough," he added. "it is very, very stringent." kirby's statement also comes as the state department is preparing to set new resettlement goals for 2017. officials tell cnn the us next year plans to take in 110,000 refugees, up from 85,000 in the 2016 fiscal year, but it's unclear how many of these will be from syria or the surrounding region.       state dept. official: 'potential' for isis to infiltrate refugee flows      
__label__0 washington (cnn)at a rally in north carolina on tuesday, donald trump, the republican nominee states: "our african american communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. ever, ever, ever." the statement is so patently absurd, fact-checking it seems kind of silly. but rather than just give the general response of "what about slavery?" or "how about segregation?" or "how about when black people couldn't vote?" a couple of empirical data points and a bit of history provide just a few examples of how wrong the statement is. consider: - a number of black men have been shot and killed by police officers in recent years. that is tragic. but between 1882 and 1931, there were 3,318 black people lynched. that's, on average, more than 1 black person strung up without a trial every week during a 50-year-period. - last year 32.7% of black children lived in families with incomes below the poverty line. pretty horrible. but in 1965, it was 65.6% of all black kids who were living in poverty. - the shooting of an unarmed black man in tulsa is horrible. but in 1921, marauding white mobs, some dropping dynamite from airplanes, killed scores of black people - some estimates range up to 300 - in tulsa's greenwood neighborhood. authorities detained more than 6,000 black folks just to protect them from being slain. history is loaded with examples of how while things may be tough for black people now, times were infinitely more difficult in the past.        reality check: trump's view of state of black america really, really, really wrong      
__label__0 (cnn)sen. tim scott said thursday that instituting stop-and-frisk policing -- like the kind republican presidential nominee donald trump has called for -- could be a potential impingement on constitutional rights, adding that the policy would be ineffective at easing police-community relations. "the reality of it is that you don't need to violate the constitution to keep communities safe," the republican south carolinian told cnn's jake tapper on "the lead." "we're seeing an increase, an improvement, in public life, in quality of life in south carolina because we learned how to work together." related: reality check: was 'stop-and-frisk' effective? communities that are at a higher risk of crime would benefit from collaborating directly with law enforcement officials, said scott, who is the us senate's sole black republican. "we still have issues, we still have challenges, but we're working the right direction," scott said. trump recently touted the policing practice and has brought up the topic during recent public appearances, adding that stop-and-frisk policies have worked in some cities to lower crime. "we did it in new york, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically," trump said in response to an audience member's question during a pre-taped fox news town hall. he said the following morning that his comments were in regards to how to stop gun violence in chicago. in light of recent police shootings in tulsa, oklahoma and charlotte, north carolina, scott said while relations between law enforcement and community members are increasingly fraught, those who want to see change must partner with police to delineate a clear path for the future. "part of the pain and the suffering that happens without clarity is that people jump to conclusions and sometimes it's the wrong conclusion," he said. "the faster the information jumps to the surface, the more information that provides clarity, hopefully the greater the calm will be." scott cited how publicizing video footage of police shootings -- as in the case in oklahoma, as well as following a 2015 fatal police shooting in scott's home town of north charleston -- gives communities more clarity about the incidents. "i'm simply here to suggest that there are some solutions that will provide greater clarity and provide a more panoramic view of the situation," he said. "body cameras (are) a part of that." with protests surrounding recent police shootings cropping up around the country -- with some turning violent -- scott said the most appropriate response would be to forge a path allowing the community to come together with law enforcement to draft key policies. "there is never a reason for violence in response to the situation," scott told tapper. "violence for violence only begets more violence. this is the wrong direction in the wrong path."       tim scott on stop-and-frisk: 'you don't need to violate the constitution to keep communities safe'      
__label__0 (cnn)as charlotte becomes the latest city to erupt in racial tension, massachusetts' highest court ruled this week that just because a black suspect flees police, it does not necessarily signify guilt. the supreme judicial court held unanimously that a black male in boston, when approached by the police, "might just as easily be motivated by the desire to avoid the recurring indignity of being racially profiled as by the desire to hide criminal activity." the court pointed to statistics in a recent boston police department report that revealed that "black men in the city of boston were more likely to be targeted for police-civilian encounters such as stops, frisks, searches, observations and interrogations." the case at issue concerned jimmy warren, who was stopped in december 2011 by a boston police officer responding to a break in that had occurred in the neighborhood. responding police officer christopher r. carr saw warren and a friend and called out, "hey fellas." warren turned and ran up a hill into a park and carr observed him clutching the right side of his pants. carr lost sight of warren, but eventually caught up with him in the backyard of a house. carr drew his weapon and yelled for him to get down. after a struggle, carr arrested warren and found no gun on his person. minutes after the arrest police recovered a walther .22 caliber firearm in the front yard. warren told the officer that he did not have a license to carry a firearm and he was later charged with unlawful possession. nelson p. lovins, brought the case to the state's high court after warren lost below. lovins argued that police did not have the reasonable suspicion to issue a stop, and the gun evidence had to be suppressed. he argued that the police pursued his client with the intent of questioning him, but they lacked the basis to do so. "my client was never charged with a break in -- only with illegal possession of a gun, " lovins said in an interview. the court ruled in warren's favor, noting that a stop has to be grounded in an officers' "reasonable suspicion" that the person was involved with a crime. that suspicion, the court said, had to be grounded in "specific, articulable facts." "we are not persuaded that the information available to the police at the time of the seizure was sufficiently specific to establish reasonable suspicion that the defendant was connected to the breaking and entering under investigation," the court held, then walking through all of the factors the police had considered including the description of the suspects, the proximity to the crime, and the fact that warren had run. on the last factor, the court pointed out a "cautionary note" pointing to statistics specific to boston. the court warned that a reasonable suspicion calculus "cannot be divorced from the finding in a recent boston police department report documenting a pattern of racial profiling" of black males in the city. the court said it did not eliminate flight as a factor for the reasonable suspicion analysis whenever a black male is the subject of an investigatory stop, but in those circumstances "flight is not necessarily probative of a suspect's state of mind or consciousness of guilt." "rather, the finding that black males in boston are disproportionately and repeatedly targeted" the court said, "suggests a reason for flight totally unrelated to consciousness of guilt." lovins hopes that this case will influence trial judges down the road that just because a black man is fleeing that doesn't necessarily mean he is guilty. "we've demonstrated that there are other reasons for flight, certainly in the case of black males who have been targeted for stops and searches disproportionally," he said. a spokesperson for the boston police department issued a statement saying the court's decision was "very troubling." "for it to consider studies that were never introduced into evidence or offered into the record is concerning," the statement said, "at the very least the court should have heard from experts who compiled and analyzed the data." matthew segal, the legal director of the aclu of massachusetts, says that the police and prosecutors invited the data into the discussions because they are the ones who asserted that flight was automatically suspicious. the aclu used the same statistics from the boston police department to conclude that black people and communities in boston were not being treated the same as white people in white communities. "this is a potentially huge decision," said segal. "the black lives matter movement can change the law in this country, if more courts follow the lead of the supreme judicial court and look at the reasonableness standard from the perspective of the civilian.

__label__0 washington (cnn)sen. joe manchin strongly defended his daughter, heather bresch, over growing criticism that her company dramatically raised prices for its life-saving medicine in order to enrich her company -- and herself. in an exclusive interview with cnn, the west virginia democrat broke his silence and sharply criticized lawmakers from both parties who have seized on the rising cost of epipen to bash his daughter's stewardship of her company, mylan. he said lawmakers were trying to be "sensational" by seizing on bresch's multi-million-dollar compensation. and he slammed an article in usa today for questioning whether his wife, gayle, improperly used her position in an education group to boost the drug's prices, calling it a "cheap shot" and "tabloid" journalism. he praised mylan as a west virginia company that saved the country $180 billion. bresch became a target of derision over the summer after a nearly 500% increase in the cost of the lifesaving allergy drug epipen, which is one of the company's signature products. the drug, which cost around $100 in 2009, shot up to as much as $600. the move sparked outrage from parents with children who rely on the drug, and even prompted comments from democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton on the need to rein in rising drug costs. one of those parents was actually a colleague of manchin -- minnesota sen. amy klobuchar -- and multiple members of congress called for hearings on the spiking cost. above all else, manchin said it was unfair to blame mylan for the dramatic increase in epipen, saying it was a problem in a "convoluted" system and middlemen that helped raise the price. "heather is the most caring, sharing, generous person i've ever met in my entire life - most accomplished and tougher than nails," he said. "absolutely," manchin said when asked if his daughter was forthright to house lawmakers during a contentious hearing wednesday. "but people have to listen, too." he added: "we can criticize and beat the living crap out of anyone we want to, and that was proven yesterday. but does that solve the problem? do they really want to solve the problem?" bresch earned nearly $19 million last year. manchin suggested that the attacks on his daughter's compensation, which he called "pretty sensational," were to be expected given her success. "you have to expect that, you know," he said. "i make $174,000. they haven't attacked me yet, but i'm sure that people who make less than 174 would attack us, too." asked if his daughter performed well, manchin said that while anyone can always improve, she succeeded given the circumstances. "that's a hostile environment," he said. "do they really want to fix a problem or do they want to make a statement for the next campaign?" cnn's david wright contributed reporting.      first on cnn: manchin defends daughter over epipen controversy      
__label__0 washington (cnn)the military assesses that the shell fired on a joint us-iraqi base tuesday was indeed a chemical weapon, according to chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen. joseph dunford. "we assess it to be a sulfur mustard blister agent," dunford told the senate armed services committee thursday. it is the first time the military has confirmed its assessment on the record since cnn reported the development wednesday. a us military official told cnn, however, that the first field test for chemical agent was positive and the second test was negative. the substance was sent to a coalition-operated iraq-based lab, and tests there were inconclusive. the official said the sample will now be sent to another lab for additional testing. related: isis suspected of mustard attack against us and iraqi troops dunford described isis as only having a "rudimentary" capability to deliver the chemical, saying the weapon "wasn't particularly effective, but it is a concerning development." the general went on to say that the us-led counter-isis coalition has conducted "over 30" airstrikes against suspected isis chemical weapons facilities during the past year. committee chairman john mccain said that the situation was "concerning, particularly on those people who don't have protective equipment." the arizona republican was referring to civilians and other local forces that have been subjected to isis chemical attacks in the past. the more than three-hour-long testimony also featured a few heated exchanges between members of the committee and witnesses dunford and defense secretary ash carter over the defense budget and whether a no-fly zone could be implemented in syria. dunford acknowledged that the administration is "in deliberation" about the prospect of arming kurdish forces in syria, saying that doing so would "increase the prospects of our success in raqqa." he noted, though, that us ally turkey's opposition to american support for the kurds makes the situation "difficult." dunford had harsh words for russia, calling it "potentially the most significant threat to our national interests." "a combination of their behavior as well as their military capability ... would cause me to believe that they pose the most significant challenge potentially, the most significant threat to our national interests," he said, referring to their incursions in georgia and ukraine. he also said russia was responsible for the recent airstrike that targeted a un aid convoy in syria while noting that both syrian and russian aircraft had been in the vicinity of the area at the time of the attack. "it was either the russians or the regime," dunford said, adding, "there's no doubt in my mind that the russians are responsible. i just don't know whose aircraft actually dropped the bombs." carter concurred, saying, "the russians are responsible for this strike whether they conducted it or not" due to their association with the syrian regime. their comments come as the prospects of the us-russia negotiated ceasefire in syria, which would include russian-american military cooperation in fighting the terror groups isis and al nusra, appears poised to collapse. mccain slammed the accord, calling it "deeply problematic even if implemented." he also took a swipe at top us diplomat john kerry, saying, "president (barack) obama sent his intrepid but delusional secretary of state to tilt yet again at the windmill of cooperating with vladimir putin."       us military chief: 'concerning' mustard attack on us base      
__label__0 (cnn)iranian president hassan rouhani accused the united states thursday of "a lack of compliance" with the nuclear deal agreed between tehran and world powers last july. speaking to global leaders at the united nations general assembly in new york, rouhani then attacked the us for what he described as "illegal actions," referring to the us supreme court decision in april to allow us victims of terror to claim nearly $2 billion in compensation from iran's central bank. the decision allows impounded iranian assets to be distributed to more than 1,000 us survivors of terror attacks for which the us deems iranian groups responsible. rouhani blamed the ruling on the influence of "zionist pressure groups" in washington. success of 'moderation' but the iranian president, who faces an election in may and has been sharply criticized by hardliners for making concessions the us to accomplish the nuclear pact, did offer some positive words about the agreement. the ability of iran and world powers to negotiate the deal indicates "the success we can achieve through moderation, constructive interaction, dialogue -- the policy that brought an end to a long, complicated and unnecessary crisis by adopting a win-win approach," he told the gathered international luminaries. he added that "it was a political deal that also represents a creative method ... to resolving international challenges." but rouhani still lit into the us at one point for its "lack of compliance" with the terms, saying that "represents a flawed approach that should be rectified forthwith." and he warned washington that any failure to implement it "will further erode the credibility of the us in the world." us rejects accusations the us rejected the accusation that it is failing to keep up its end of the bargain. "the united states has and will continue to implement its commitments under the deal with good faith and without exception," said a us state department official, who added america has "unequivocally met" its terms and has "made absolutely clear that we are committed to full and effective implementation of our sanctions-related commitments." after iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities, years of tough economic sanctions were lifted under the deal, allowing tehran's oil to be sold internationally. iran has been frustrated that it has not seen more of an economic benefit stemming from the deal, with many countries still wary of doing business with the country. spread of terror rouhani's critique didn't stop there, blaming global powers' post 9/11 security strategies for "the genesis of borderless violence and terrorism" in the world. speaking in new york 15 years after the mass terror attack, he said that "no one imagined that this occurrence would lead to larger disasters resulting in a devastating war in the middle east and the spread of insecurity across the globe." inside 9/11: the day that never ends he pointed to the plight of the syrian, iraqi, yemeni, afghan and palestinian people, while calling on neighbors to "stop bombing each other and accept responsibility for past mistakes". saudi arabia iran's president also pointed his finger at regional rival saudi arabia, warning that the country must "cease and desist from divisive policies" if peace is to be found in the middle east. "if the saudi government is serious about its vision for development and regional security, it must cease and desist from divisive policies, spread of hate ideology, and trampling upon the rights of neighbors," rouhani told world leaders. senate rejects bid to block us-saudi arabia arms deal shi'ite-led iran and the saudi arabian sunni monarchy are on opposing sides of the syrian conflict, with iran sending forces and advisers to back syrian president bashar al-assad while its rival supports syrian rebel groups. they are also divided over yemen. the saudis have accused iran of backing the houthi rebels, who seized power from the government in march. at least 30 yemeni civilians were killed wednesday in saudi-led airstrikes in the port region of hodieda.       iran's president rouhani slams us 'lack of compliance' with nuclear deal      
__label__0 boise, idaho (cnn)donald trump jr. said thursday he was surprised by the reaction to his tweet comparing syrian refugees to skittles because he was "trying to point out things that have to be said." "people will today make what they want of anything and they see the worst in everything and they look for subtext that doesn't exist," trump told reporters after a fundraiser here. "for me, i guess i'm a straightforward guy. i don't deal in microagression, where it takes a special kind of person to find whatever message they're looking for." the tweet -- which consisted of a photo of a bowl full of the candy that said: "if i had a bowl of skittles and i told you just three would kill you. would you take a handful? that's our syrian refugee problem." -- took center stage on the campaign trail earlier this week. a top aide to hillary clinton called it "disgusting" and clinton supporters attacking the comparison as crass and inhumane. but trump supporters -- and the trump campaign itself -- have repeatedly defended trump and the tweet. mars, which produces skittles, rejected the comparison in a statement, saying, "skittles are candy. refugees are people. we don't feel it's an appropriate analogy." trump said he didn't "want to be a distraction" to the campaign, but that the negative response was being driven by partisan attacks. "i understand that running as conservative, there is a different standard," he said. "if a metaphor offends someone then maybe that's the world in which we live today, but i'm not comparing someone to candy," trump said. "it's a statistical thing. we have to be careful about who we let into this country." but the statistics don't actually back up the contention made in the tweet. according to a recent cato institute report, the odds "that an american would be killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee was 1 in 3.64 billion a year." still, trump said thursday that it was his broader point was what mattered and that it was part of a discussion that needed to be had and one that tracked closely with the key components of his father's campaign strategy. "he's created some good dialogue that needed to be had that wasn't being had because pc culture sort of forced real issues off of the table," trump said of his father's campaign. "the way he's been able to approach that and do that has forced people to actually have a dialogue and that's what this country is about, having that dialogue." that dialogue -- about race, about refugees and about immigrants -- has been harshly criticized by clinton and trump detractors as racist, but trump countered that it has been the driving force behind trump's success. "we're not a country where everything has to be in a safe space," trump said. "that's not what built this country, that's not what made this country great and that's why my father is resonating so well with working class, hard-working americans. he's giving them a voice again."       trump jr. defends skittles tweet: 'i don't deal in microaggression'      
__label__0 washington (cnn)eight days before a critical deadline, congressional negotiations over government funding stalled thursday, prompting senate republicans to force a vote on a bill that democrats warned they would reject. the gop gambit came after months of talks between the two parties and raises doubts about the ability of congress to pass a bill before the september 30 deadline, when the government could shut down. frustrated by the lack of progress, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-kentucky, went to the senate floor and announced the gop would drop several thorny issues -- known as "riders" -- that still need to be resolved. the tactic was designed to pressure democrats to accept what mcconnell called a "clean" government funding bill. "there have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution. so that's what i've just offered. it's the result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle," mcconnell said when he filed the gop bill. "it's a fair proposal that funds all current government operations through december 9." the gop proposal was immediately panned by democrats because it left out funds for flint, michigan, where the drinking water supply was poisoned by lead in the past year. if the chamber's 46 democrats stick together, they can block the bill from advancing. "we are now down to a handful of issues, but they are down to the real issues. now the republican leader, the majority leader, has filed a republican-only bill," said sen. barbara mikulski of maryland, the top democrat on the appropriations committee. "we democrats cannot vote for that." house democratic leader nancy pelosi criticized the republican proposal, saying "it falls very short." pelosi said democrats objected to the way republicans offset the money directed at zika and said the riders republicans were pushing showed they have "a tin ear." on thursday night, however, florida sen. bill nelson became the first democrat to publicly say he will support the bill because it offers zika funding, a priority for his state. the turn of events was somewhat unexpected as leaders in each party had signaled for days they were close to a deal and didn't anticipate a real threat of a government shutdown, just weeks before the election. with the balance of power in the senate at stake, gop leaders are anxious to complete their work and send their vulnerable members home to campaign. they also want to demonstrate to voters they can govern effectively and deserve to remain in power. house speaker paul ryan downplayed the back-and-forth between the parties over the must-pass bill to avoid another re-run of the 2013 shutdown, saying "our members realize that we want to get our work done. we don't want to have high drama around here this time." ryan said members aren't necessarily pleased that they will have to vote for a short-term funding bill, but recognize that is the option they ultimately have to back to avoid a shutdown. "there's never no drama around here -- we're going to have low drama and our members want that," ryan said. in addition to funding the government at current levels for the next three months, the measure offered by mcconnell includes $1.1 billion to combat zika, $500 million to respond to flooding in louisiana and elsewhere, and $37 million to tackle the widening opioid epidemic through the recently enacted comprehensive addiction and recovery act. mcconnell called the $500 million for flooding a "down payment" suggesting additional money would be approved soon. democrats dispute the bill has that much money in it for opioids. a handful of unresolved and controversial riders were dropped from the bill. one would have forced a delay in turning authority over internet domain names to an international consortium -- something republican presidential nominee donald trump and sen. ted cruz, r-texas, oppose. others dealt with how the export-import bank functions and truck driver fatigue. the decision to drop the riders had immediate implications as sen. lindsey graham, r-south carolina, said he would not vote for the measure without the export-import bank provision, which is important to his state. despite moving forward without democrats, a top senate gop leadership aide said republicans are still open to continuing talks to resolve differences. mcconnell said there would have the next four days to consider the bill before any votes take place. in the meantime, neither chamber is expected to be in session until next week.       government funding talks stall ahead of next week's shutdown deadline      
__label__0 colorado springs, colorado (cnn)indiana gov. mike pence told a church group here thursday that there is "far too much of this talk of institutional bias or racism within law enforcement" during a conversation about faith. pence was answering a question posed by bishop john brannon who asked about how pence as vice president could personally unite the nation. pence referenced recent police shootings of black men in tulsa, oklahoma, and charlotte, north carolina, saying, "it's a very troubling time for us." the charlotte shootings, which led to violence and unrest in that city this week, have sparked discussions of lethal police force against african-americans. pence mentioned faith as his first means to reunite the country and reduce violence, but then said he thought there was too much talk of how law enforcement officers conduct themselves. "donald trump and i believe there's been far too much of this talk of institutional bias or racism within law enforcement. that police officers are human beings. in difficult and life threatening situations, mistakes are made and people have to be held to strict account," pence said. the governor reiterated his belief that it is a challenging time to be in law enforcement and doubled down that "we ought to set aside this talk about institutional racism and institutional bias." he finished his answer by saying it's time to "move away from the rhetoric of division and embrace the rhetoric of unity." the governor expressed his opinion that when tragedies happen, voices of division come forward instead of voices of unity, though he did not directly mention president barack obama's leadership. asked wednesday about the police shootings in charlotte and tulsa, trump did not address the charlotte incident but said he was "very, very troubled" by the shooting of terence crutcher, an unarmed black man, in tulsa on friday night.       pence: 'too much talk' of institutional, racial bias in law enforcement      
__label__0 washington (cnn)the top democrats on congress' intelligence committees boldly blamed russian intelligence agencies for a series of hacks designed to influence the us presidential election. california sen. dianne feinstein and california rep. adam schiff, the ranking members on the senate and house intelligence committees, respectively, released a joint statement on thursday calling out russian president vladimir putin and his government. "based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the us election," the democrats said. "at the least, this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election -- we can see no other rationale for the behavior of the russians." unlike past hedged comments from us lawmakers and officials, the statement was definitive and more forceful than any previous assertions about russian hacking from top-level government sources. and in tying the hacking directly to putin and/or senior levels of russian government, the democrats were more forceful than the administration or congress has been in the past. "we believe that orders for the russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the russian government," schiff and feinstein said. "we call on president putin to immediately order a halt to this activity. americans will not stand for any foreign government trying to influence our election. we hope all americans will stand together and reject the russian effort." kerry delivers blistering attack on russia at un experts have pinpointed russian government-affiliated hackers as the source of cyberattacks on a number of democratic political groups, including the democratic national committee and democratic congressional campaign committee. communications and documents stolen in those hacks have been selectively leaked online since, by a hacker claiming to be unaffiliated with the russians going by "guccifer 2.0." but analysis by private-sector cybersecurity firms have concluded that the character is most likely a front for the russians to cast doubt on their culpability. two other hacks -- both of state election boards -- have also been loosely tied to potential russian hackers. in illinois, thousands of voter role records were accessed, and arizona was also targeted. though nothing was done to influence elections in those states, experts believe russian hacking is designed to cast doubt in the security and validity of the election. schiff and feinstein did not explain what in their briefings led to their conclusion. intelligence committee members receive classified briefings they can't speak about in public. they also broke with the administration in their condemnation of russia. the white house has referred to the beliefs of experts on the hacks, but have not discussed any conclusions drawn by us government investigators. the administration has also been navigating a tense relationship with russia over the conflict in syria, with both sides pointing fingers over a fraught ceasefire agreement." no republicans joined their statement. the hacks have been perceived as a benefit to gop nominee donald trump over democrat hillary clinton. trump has spoken favorably of putin in the past, and democrats have tried to paint him as friendly to the authoritarian leader. the hacks have been damaging to the democratic party, leading to the resignation of then-chairwoman debbie wasserman-schultz on the eve of the democratic convention in july. in return, democrats have asked republicans to not use material from the hacks due to the suspect russian involvement. cnn's nicole gaouette contributed to this report.      russian intelligence agencies behind us election hacks, lawmakers say      
__label__0 washington (cnn)rep. trent franks backed ted cruz during the gop presidential primary, but he now has a message for the texas republican: get in line behind donald trump. "any person in this party that does not support trump at this point is increasing the chances of hillary clinton becoming president and destroying the constitution," franks said. on the other side, cruz backers say that the first-term senator should stick to his guns and withhold an endorsement -- or risk angering his own supporters who detest trump. "i have five rules for political endorsements," said steve deace, an iowa radio talk show host who was an outspoken cruz backer during the primary. "and cruz endorsing trump violates every single one of them." less than two months until election day, trump has once again put cruz in a bind. as trump's poll numbers rise and now is neck-and-neck against clinton, the gop nominee's backers are looking for every last ounce of support to showcase that there is momentum and energy behind his campaign. if trump falls short of clinton by a narrow margin, trump's backers are bound to blame holdouts like cruz for failing to do more to help their party. yet if cruz backs trump now, he'll be accused of political opportunism and anger his core supporters who hailed his controversial speech at the republican national convention where he pointedly declined to endorse his party's nominee. it would mean embracing a man who during the primaries taunted the senator with the nickname "lyin' ted," suggested cruz wasn't eligible to be president due to his canadian birthplace, and speculated that cruz's father was involved in the jfk assassination. cruz risks getting little credit for backing trump belatedly, while turning off the anti-trump wing of the party that is bound to become more vocal -- and potentially more powerful -- if clinton wins the white house. "he's in a box," said one senior senate republican. yet, trump has hired key cruz allies, including campaign manager kellyanne conway and spokesman jason miller. and in a sign of a thawing of relations, trump on wednesday expressed support for a cruz-backed, internet-related proposal in government funding talks in the senate. cruz tweeted his appreciation for trump. but when the senate dropped the language from the government funding bill thursday, the texas republican stayed mostly quiet in the chamber -- a departure from his usually outspoken style. in recent days, cruz has been making comments of the gop nominee that are emblematic of the tightrope he's trying to walk. he is declining to say if he would formally offer his endorsement of trump, but argued that clinton should never be elected president. in effect, he's trying to show that he is willing to help the party without formally giving his blessing to trump. "my focus is on defeating hillary clinton and helping preserve a senate republican majority," cruz told cnn. "because we need a federal government that is devoted to defending the constitution, to defeating radical islamic terrorism and keeping this country safe." asked if that meant he could endorse trump before november, cruz added: "i've given you my answer." a cruz aide told cnn that the senator has not made a decision yet on whether to endorse trump but has never ruled out the possibility, even if he previously called the gop nominee a "serial philanderer," "utterly amoral," and "a narcissist at a level i don't think this country's ever seen. "he thinks about it every day," cruz's former campaign jeff roe, who was cruz's campaign manager, told reporters at a bloomberg event this week. "i'm hoping there's still time for him to come forward, or i think he and all the other people you named will be left in the rear view mirror of the republican party moving forward," texas lt. gov. dan patrick, a republican, told radio talk show host laura ingraham this week. working with fellow senators the back-and-forth comes as cruz is trying to showcase a more collaborate style in the senate in recent weeks. after calling his colleagues part of a corrupt "washington cartel," criticizing their convictions and battling them over policy and tactics for three years, he has, in the words of one of his colleagues, made "nice." he transferred $100,000 over to the national republican senatorial committee recently. and next month, he is joining the senior texas senator, john cornyn, to headline two fundraising events in houston and dallas for gop senators up for reelection, including missouri sen. roy blunt, iowa sen. chuck grassley, north carolina sen. richard burr, new hampshire sen. kelly ayotte and pennsylvania sen. pat toomey. "we're working on that together," cornyn said. cruz himself may need help from his fellow lawmakers in two years. he faces a possible 2018 senate primary challenge from texas rep. michael mccaul, the chairman of the house homeland security committee, who has increasingly made an issue of cruz's failure to endorse trump. "i mean, [cruz] pledged to support him," mccaul told ingraham this week. "he broke his word." cnn's theodore schleifer contributed to this report.      donald trump's rise puts ted cruz in a bind      
__label__0 (cnn)the fate of several dead american isis hostages quietly came back to the forefront at a senate armed services committee hearing thursday when a member asked defense secretary ash carter to find a way to bring their bodies home. sen. joe donnelly brought the issue up amid growing talk by military commanders about using kurdish and arab forces to push isis out of raqqa, the terror group's stronghold in syria and self-declared capital. the us believes several of the us hostages murdered by isis likely were killed in the raqqa area and their bodies have never been recovered. "when we go to raqqa, we lost some young men and women there who were killed by isil, and we want to have them come home, " said donnelly, an indiana democrat, using another word for isis. "we don't want to leave anyone behind. and we would ask for your cooperation and assistance," he said to carter. donnelly specifically mentioned peter kassig, an aid worker killed in november 2014, and kayla mueller, another aid worker isis held, tortured and then claimed died in an airstrike. the us believes the american hostages, including journalist james foley, were killed by the now-dead isis operative known as jihadi john. "all the parents and all the folks back home, we want them all to come home. and we'd sure appreciate your assistance in making that happen," donnelly said. carter answered "noted." the military is aware of the families' desires, but also knows how very tough that job may be, one defense official told cnn. the us military has a long history of trying to recover the remains of dead americans. recently the bodies of two american civilians who fought and were killed with militia groups fighting isis were returned to the us. and fallen service members missing on foreign battlefields are still being searched for from the vietnam and korean wars, as well as world war ii. the us also searched for years in iraq for the scott speicher, a downed navy pilot from the first gulf war, until his remains were recovered in 2009. but whether the remains of the hostages can be located, identified and brought home may be very difficult the defense official said. it's widely believed there are a number of burial sites around raqqa and without some confirmation of where the americans are buried it may be too sensitive to begin removing remains.       lawmakers press for return of isis-slain us hostage bodies      
__label__0 washington (cnn)donald trump's rebound in national polls extends to four swing states in which he has either narrowed the margin by which he trailed hillary clinton or extended his lead over her, according to a new poll. a quinnipiac university survey released thursday shows trump trailing by just 2 points in colorado, a state where clinton had opened up a wide lead and where democrats had halted advertising. clinton is ahead 44% to 42%, within the poll's margin of error. it's a similarly tightened race in virginia, where ads had similarly stopped, as clinton leads by 6 points, 45% to 39%. in georgia, trump is now up by 7 points, 47% to 40%, putting some distance between himself and clinton in what is typically a reliably republican state. and in iowa, which has leaned in trump's direction for the entire general election, he is also up by 7 points, 44% to 37%. gary johnson, the libertarian candidate, earns 10%, 8%, 9% and 10% in colorado, virginia, georgia and iowa, respectively. "leads for donald trump in georgia and iowa and a virtual tie in colorado plus a 6-point lead for clinton in virginia represent a major improvement overall for him in these states," peter brown, the director of the poll, said in a statement. after august, during which clinton was posting at times double-digit national leads over trump, the republican nominee has closed the gap considerably and most surveys show a tight single-digit gap. yet clinton still has an easier path to 270 electoral votes, due in no small part to virginia and colorado, two states expected to be battlegrounds that clinton had been thought to have put away early in the race. trump would have more paths to the white house should those states become more competitive. quinnipiac surveyed likely voters from september 13 to september 21, and the margin of error is 3.9 percentage points in colorado and georgia, 3.8 points in virginia and 4 points in iowa. six hundred and forty-four individuals were polled in colorado, 638 in georgia, 659 in virginia and 612 in iowa.       poll: clinton's lead shrinks in colorado and virginia      
__label__0 (cnn)the clintons are building a compound in chappaqua, new york. hillary and bill clinton have bought the house next door to their current home in chappaqua, new york, for $1.16 million, according to deed information on the 33 old house lane home. the 3,631-square-foot home, which was previously owned by architect charles chepigin, was sold to the clintons on august 11, according to the documents. the clintons currently own the the 5,300-square-foot home at 15 old house lane, a property they bought in 1999 as bill clinton was leaving the white house and hillary clinton was running for senate in new york. that home was purchased for $1.7 million. by purchasing the new home, the clinton's now own the entire cul-de-sac at the end of the road in the leafy new york suburb. the purchase makes it easier for the united states secret service to protect the former president and possible future commander in chief. months ago, gawkers were able to drive up to the clinton's gate and take photos. reporters assigned to clinton regularly position outside the home. but the new castle town board voted in august to designate the lane a local-traffic-only street, meaning that there is no parking allowed on either side of the drive. shortly after that decision, agents protecting clinton barricaded the street and began to screen cars at the start of the cul-de-sac. the clinton's new home was listed by douglas elliman, a large real estate firm with a location in chappaqua. the listing boasted about how the home was "located close to town on a unique cul-de-sac." housing decisions are not uncommon for presidential candidates, but they have also landed some in hot water. republican mitt romney wanted to demolish his 3,100-square-foot home in la jolla, california, before the 2012 election in order to build a 11,000-square-foot mansion with a car elevator. the plans were put on hold until after the election and a neighbor had appealed the building decision to the california coastal commission because, in his view, the new home would have exceeded zoning limits. after the election -- which romney lost -- the coastal commission rejected the appeal.       bill and hillary clinton are building a chappaqua compound      
__label__0 washington (cnn)protesters angry over the police killings of unarmed black men won't prompt change through violence, president barack obama said during an interview thursday. speaking a day after riots erupted in charlotte over the killing of keith lamont scott, obama said anger should instead be redirected toward pushing needed reforms. "the way we change the system requires us to be able to reach out and engage the broader american community. and that requires being peaceful," obama said during an interview with abc news. "the overwhelming majority of people who have been concerned about police community relations doing it the right way. every once in awhile, you see folks doing it the wrong way." obama -- who also offered debate advice to democrat hillary clinton in the interview -- said the violence that has raged in cities such as charlotte, baltimore and ferguson, missouri, shouldn't distract americans from real concerns about systemic biases within us law enforcement agencies. "i think it's important to separate out the pervasive sense of frustration among a lot of african-americans about shootings of people and the sense that justice is not always always, you know, colorblind," he said. obama has sought to encourage reforms in police departments by convening a policing commission and recommending a set of common practices. but the white house says specific reforms should be left to local forces who best understand their communities' needs. "it's the responsibility of local law enforcement leaders and local elected officials to determine how and whether to pursue the implementation of these best practices," obama's spokesman josh earnest said thursday. "it's not something that can be imposed by the federal government." clinton spoke with charlotte mayor jennifer roberts and democratic north carolina rep. alma adams, whose district includes charlotte, about the shooting and protests today, a clinton aide said. they discussed "steps we must take to ensure that everyone is respected by the law, and everyone has respect for the law," the aide added. meanwhile, republican presidential nominee donald trump is considering a trip to charlotte next week after monday's debate, two aides told cnn. campaign officials are looking at the logistics involved in such a trip, which would also bring trump to a critical battleground state. in his interview with abc, obama also offered debate advice for clinton, his preferred successor. "be yourself and explain what motivates you," he said. "i think there's a reason why we haven't had a woman president before, and so she's having to break down some barriers. there's a level of mistrust and a caricature of her that just doesn't jibe with who i know." cnn's jim acosta and dan merica contributed to this report.      obama: violent protests won't solve policing issues      
__label__0 washington (cnn)syria's prolonged and bloody civil war "haunts" president barack obama, he told an interviewer this month, though he isn't naming any specific policy change he believes could have stemmed the suffering there. speaking with presidential historian doris kearns goodwin for vanity fair, obama said the grim situation in syria "haunts me constantly." "i would say of all the things that have happened during the course of my presidency, the knowledge that you have hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed, millions who have been displaced, (makes me) ask myself what might i have done differently along the course of the last five, six years," he said. obama's efforts to ease the humanitarian crisis in syria have largely fallen short since an uprising against president bashar al-assad turned violent five years ago. the latest attempt with russia to broker peace in syria is unraveling amid mutual recriminations. "the conventional arguments about what could have been done are wrong," he said. "but i do ask myself, 'was there something that we hadn't thought of? was there some move that is beyond what was being presented to me that maybe a churchill could have seen, or an eisenhower might have figured out?'" "that's the kind of thing that tends to occupy me when i have the time to think about it," he said. "usually, i'm pretty good about sorting through the options and then making decisions that i'm confident are the best decisions in that moment, given the information we have. but there are times where i think i wish i could have imagined a different level of insight." obama 'skeptical' of policy changes over the course of the civil war, obama has considered taking strikes against assad's positions as a consequence for the regime's use of chemical weapons on civilians, and has weighed arming various rebel factions who are battling the government. in the interview, obama said he was "skeptical" taking those actions could have made any real difference in the war. syria's crisis consumed much of the president's time this week at his final united nations general assembly, where he worked to convince his foreign counterparts to step up their commitments for accepting refugees from the war-torn country. he said during a special session on the refugee crisis that the world had come up short in its response. "we all know that what is happening in syria ... is unacceptable," he said. "and we are not as unified as we should be in pushing to make it stop." but in those remarks, and during his interview with vanity fair, obama didn't lay out any specific changes to his approach in syria to bring an end to the country's strife. his spokesman said thursday that obama would continue making choices based on the national security interests of the us. "the president's syria policy has been second-guessed by many, many people. i think the president acknowledged in the interview that he himself has reviewed the decisions that he has had to make with regard to us policy in syria," press secretary josh earnest said. "and as he has reviewed those decisions, he's concluded that each time he made a decision that was squarely within the national security interest of the united states and even advanced our national security interests."       obama says syria war 'haunts' him      
__label__0 washington (cnn)two republican senators are expressing concern to the head of the department of homeland security over what they said was a "rush" to process new citizens ahead of the presidential election. in the letter to jeh johnson, sens. chuck grassley of iowa and ron johnson of wisconsin specifically suggest that new voters could provide democrats with an advantage. they refer to an internal agency email from us citizenship and immigration services about processing applications "due to the election year." the memo encourages dhs staff to work overtime to process applications and notes several saturdays that offices will be open to help process applications. the senators say a similar effort in 1996 to increase citizenship applications "endangered national security and public safety" because not all the cases were processed following the correct protocol, such as fingerprint checks. the department of homeland security said it aims to ensure naturalization applications are processed on time. "uscis's goal is to process applications for naturalization within five to seven months, regardless of external events such as elections. uscis uses statistical forecasting models to plan for the potential increased volume of work. uscis anticipated that there would be a spike in applications this year, as we usually see in an election year, but the increase ... has exceeded expectations," homeland security said in a statement. the prospect of more immigrants becoming citizens likely stands to benefit democrats. the implications are controversial because democrats have made a push to get new immigrants to register to vote, aiming to build up an anti-trump demographic particularly among latinos. latinos line up to get naturalized and stop trump us citizenship and immigration services show a 14.5% jump in naturalization applications in june-december of 2015 compared with the same six months in the previous year. federal data does not break down those applications by race, but grass-roots organizations, like the florida immigrant coalition, say their naturalization drives across their swing state are filled primarily by latinos, who overwhelmingly vote democrat. trump calls for 'national anti-crime agenda' after charlotte unrest democrats have been accused by republicans during the 2016 season of trying to increase turnout by adding voters. republican presidential nominee donald trump last month slammed an effort by democratic virginia gov. terry mcauliffe to restore voting rights to some convicted felons who have completed their sentences.       gop senators ask dhs about 'rush' to process citizens ahead of election      
__label__0 washington (cnn)a congressman who represents north carolina apologized thursday for saying there are riots in charlotte because the protesters "hate white people." "the grievance in their mind is that the animus, the anger -- they hate white people, because white people are successful and they're not," rep. robert pittenger, a republican, said on the bbc's "newsnight." "i mean, yes, it is, it is a welfare state. we have spent trillions of dollars on welfare, where we put people in bondage so that they cannot be all that they're capable of being." pittenger, who has represented north carolina's ninth congressional district since 2013, emphasized that people come to the united states for opportunities, not government handouts. obama: violent protests won't solve policing issues "america is a country of opportunity and freedom and liberty," he said. "it didn't become that way because of a great government who provided everything for everyone, no." pittenger told cnn's don lemon on "cnn tonight" thursday that he was repeating comments he'd heard from protesters. "frankly, i was quoting what they were saying last night on what i observed on your network. and their hatred for white people," pittenger said. "and that saddens me greatly." "you believe the protesters hate white people?" lemon asked. "no, no, sir. it's the comment that they made. i think you can go back and look at the tapes. the comments that they made on air," pittenger responded. "you mean the protesters made on air?" lemon asked. "yes sir. i was only trying to convey what they were saying and yet, it didn't come out right, and i apologize. i have many, many good friends in the african-american community," he said. pittenger's office also released a statement apologizing for comments, saying he didn't mean to offend anyone. "what is taking place in my hometown right now breaks my heart. my anguish led me to respond to a reporter's question in a way that i regret," he said in the statement. "the answer doesn't reflect who i am. i was quoting statements made by angry protesters last night on national tv. my intent was to discuss the lack of economic mobility for african-americans because of failed policies. i apologize to those i offended and hope we can bring peace and calm to charlotte." on tuesday in charlotte, keith lamont scott, an african-american, was shot by a police officer after refusing repeated demands to put down what authorities said was a gun. riots and protests in the city began that night and continued on wednesday and thursday nights. president barack obama weighed in on the unrest thursday, saying that the anger should be directed toward pushing needed reforms.       north carolina congressman: protesters 'hate white people'      
__label__0 (cnn)north korea went on the offensive friday, blasting the us for "aggression" in asia, blaming washington for its pursuit of nuclear weapons and threatening the us with "tremendous consequences beyond imagination." the democratic people's republic of korea "had no other choice but to go nuclear," foreign minister ri yong ho told the un general assembly, to defend itself "from the constant nuclear threats from the united states." ri's comments came as the us and asian nations gathered in new york friday with a fresh reminder of what they consider the gravest threat facing the region: north korea's announcement this week that it had successfully tested its most powerful rocket engine yet. the test tuesday was followed by a us show of force, as the pentagon on wednesday flew two b-1b bombers alongside the demilitarized zone separating north and south korea, setting the the stage for us-south korea joint military exercises in october that will include a simulated nuclear facility strike. the heightened tensions, north korea's steady drumbeat of tests and its nuclear ambitions have put the region on edge and the pentagon on notice. "north korea's unpredictable behavior and capability development also continues to threaten allies and potentially the homeland," gen. joseph dunford, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said wednesday in maryland. "it's consumed an awful lot of time -- i think it's fair to say -- of senior leadership's time over the past few weeks." the north korean minister offered a through-the-looking glass version of the same events. "only a couple of days ago, the united states has again threatened the dprk by flying the strategic bombers 'b-1b' over the military demarcation line on the korean peninsula and landing in south korea," ri said. "we will never remain onlookers at it and the united states will have to face tremendous consequences beyond imagination." meanwhile, secretary of state john kerry met friday on the sidelines of the un general assembly with foreign ministers from the association of southeast asian nations, a 10-member bloc dedicated to economic, political and security cooperation. "the united states will do whatever is necessary to defend our own citizens and to honor our security commitments to our allies," kerry told the asean meeting. he called on allies to "vigorously" enforce sanctions against the isolated regime and urged asean members to "ensure that the dprk pays a price for its dangerous actions." japanese prime minister shinzo abe made a blunt call for international action at the un wednesday. "right before our eyes, north korea is carrying out a plan about which there can be no doubt," abe said. "there is no alternative but to say that the threat has now reached a dimension altogether different from what has transpired until now." the perceived threat is changing regional dynamics, bringing old rivals japan and south korea closer together. it's putting china on the spot as washington pushes beijing to do more to rein its ally in, even as tensions over the south china sea complicate cooperation. and it will likely prompt a new international push for tougher sanctions, the likes of which were used to force iran to the negotiating table. that's still unlikely to stop north korea, formally known as the democratic people's republic of korea, experts said. indeed, us officials and scientific experts expect another nuclear test as soon as early october. "from north korea's perspective, it only makes sense to continue these tests and continue to develop these weapons until there's a substantial shift in dialogue with the us," said alison evans, a country risk senior analyst at the global consulting firm ihs. "for north korea, it's the recognition that's the important thing. it needs its status as a nuclear power to be recognized," evans said, adding that, "the leadership sees developing a nuclear deterrent as a guarantor of survival." related: us b-1 bombers fly over south korea in show of force us officials say the pentagon is watching carefully for another nuclear test. meanwhile, the union of concerned scientists said there is some speculation that pyongyang may try another satellite launch around october 10, the anniversary of the founding of its worker's party of korea. north korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in january. in the ensuing months, it has followed that detonation with a total of 21 ballistic missile tests, including land- and submarine-based launches. in may, north korea's 32-year-old leader kim jong-un made the country's ambitions official, announcing that pyongyang was on a dual track of developing nuclear weapons and the economy. pyongyang then staged its largest nuclear test yet on september 9, the anniversary of the dprk's founding in 1948. and tuesday's rocket launch was "substantially larger and more powerful than anything north korea has tested before," according to 38 north, a program devoted to analyzing north korea at johns hopkins university's school of advanced international studies. all this testing is unlikely to win it the us recognition it craves, though. after the more recent nuclear test, president barack obama made clear that "the united states does not, and never will, accept north korea as a nuclear state." obama said that the us would work with asian allies, the un security council and international partners to implement existing measures and "take additional significant steps, including new sanctions to demonstrate to north korea that there are consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions." however, the rhetoric from the presidential campaign trail is a constant reminder that obama administration will soon no longer calling the american shots on the issue. republican presidential nominee donald trump has held out the possibility of meeting with kim in a dramatic break with us political conventions. he earned criticism for the remark, as well as for suggesting that south korea and japan should consider developing their own nuclear weapons. "at some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if japan protects itself against this maniac in north korea," trump told anderson cooper at a cnn town hall in milwaukee in march. "we're better off, frankly, if south korea is going to start to protect itself." the statements have rattled tokyo and seoul, and while trump has said that china must play a stronger role in checking their neighbor and ally, his promise to play tough with beijing on trade could also roil that effort. the republican candidate's tough talk has only heightened the uncertainty surrounding american policy in the region and is likely to be something that us officials are asked to address in their consultations friday.  hillary clinton has also articulated a strong stance on china, but is less likely to take the protectionist steps that could spark a trade war with the asian power. on north korea, specifically, she has emphasized ratcheting up us sanctions. international sanctions levied in march after the january nuclear test were the first on north korea to do more than target weapons development or luxury goods for the elite. they ban all weapons trade and require inspections of all cargo to and from the country, among other steps. the international community could squeeze north korea further by targeting the export of its resources, said bruce klingner, a senior research fellow at the heritage foundation, echoing the way un sanctions targeted iran by banning the export of its oil. "that is a big step," klingner said, "it will impact the people of north korea." china signed on for the march sanctions, but its officials have repeatedly said they believe sanctions are counterproductive and experts say china historically hasn't thoroughly enforced them against north korea. us tensions with china over the south china sea could make it harder to cooperate. dunford said wednesday that "china seeks to limit our ability to project power and to undermine the credibility of our alliances in the pacific." the us can take additional unilateral steps to get tougher on pyongyang, klingner said, by sanctioning non-north korean entities that act as an agent for the country -- most likely chinese entities and financial institutions. in the meantime, us military officials are planning. from october 3 to 21, the us and south korea will carry out the joint exercise "red flag" in alaska, which will include an aerial exercise "simulating attacks on nuclear facilities and scenarios of sudden missile attack," a ministry spokesperson with the south korean defense department told cnn. north korea derided south korea as a "puppet warmongers" in a statement about the red flag exercises. cnn's jungeun kim and paula hancocks in seoul and barbara starr in washington contributed to this report.      north korea at un: us faces 'consequences beyond imagination'      
__label__0 (cnn)sen. jeff sessions pilloried former president george h.w. bush's decision to support hillary clinton for president over donald trump, saying the bush family "should remember the loyalty they were given by millions of americans." sessions expressed frustration with republicans who've refused to back trump in an interview with the washington examiner published wednesday. a long-serving republican senator, he was among the first members of the so-called gop "establishment" to throw his support behind the eventual nominee during the primary, and has been a fixture of the trump campaign since. "they should objectively analyze who is likely to advance best the agenda they favor and the agenda the republicans who supported them favored. and that's clearly donald trump," sessions said. the alabama republican also noted that "millions of americans, including this one, worked their hearts out for the bushes in 1988, 1992, 2000, and 2004. and it wasn't bill clinton that helped the bushes get elected. it was the same voters, in large part, that elected ronald reagan and stand to elect donald trump." the elder bush is the only member of the family whose support for clinton has become public. jeb bush, whom trump defeated during the primary, has said he won't support the nominee, and former president george w. bush has declined to reveal his presidential preference. for sessions, though, the choice is simple, and he expressed puzzlement about the bush family. related: ivanka trump huddles with female republican members of congress in washington "i think they're not thinking clearly enough about this," sessions told the washington examiner. "they're not ... appreciating half the american people, virtually, that have been supportive of republicans. a lot of them preferred somebody other than bush candidates, but they rallied around them when it came to november. so i would hope that we see more rallying." and to other republicans, like texas sen. ted cruz or ohio gov. john kasich, who have argued trump isn't conservative enough to lead the party, sessions says "that's ridiculous." "at this point in history, it's the william f. buckley test -- who is the most conservative candidate that can win the presidency? hillary clinton or donald trump? on taxes, on regulations, on judges, on law enforcement — all these are conservative positions. what is the problem here? i just feel on issue after issue he's been firmly in the conservative, classical republican conservative view." related: the gop's next civil war is brewing       sessions knocks bushes: 'they should remember the loyalty they were given'      
__label__0 washingtonsince we last updated the cnn battleground map, donald trump has clearly improved his poll numbers both in some national polls and in some critical battleground states. the republican nominee has also upped his game (as have his allied outside group friends) with television ad spending.  and, yet, hillary clinton maintains her advantage on the road to 270 when it comes to piecing together the electoral math needed to win the presidency. why two congressional districts could be key to this election with four days to go before the highly anticipated first presidential debate and just under 7 weeks before all the votes are cast, hillary clinton still sits above that key threshold in the latest cnn outlook. when you add up all the states either solidly or currently leaning clinton's way, she has 272 electoral votes in her column in our new estimate. what's changed? -- iowa (6) moves from from "battleground" to "lean republican" -- utah (6) moves from "lean republican" to "solid republican" -- maine's 2nd congressional district (1) moves from "solid democrat" to "battleground" -- nebraska's 2nd congressional district (1) moves from "solid republican" to "battleground" explore the map and make your choices road to 270: electoral college map note: the split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines. the state of play donald trump has improved his standing in our electoral college outlook due to iowa (a state barack obama won twice) and its six electoral votes moving from the true toss-up "battleground" category into the "lean republican" category, giving trump a total of 196 electoral votes either solidly or leaning in his favor.  that leaves 70 electoral votes up for grabs across four states (plus two congressional districts) -- florida, nevada, ohio, and north carolina.  maine and nebraska award individual electoral votes by congressional district in addition to the multiple electoral votes based on statewide results. both maine and nebraska's second congressional district have moved into battleground status in this latest estimate. maine's second congressional district has moved from "solid democrat" to "battleground" and nebraska's second congressional district has moved from "solid republican" to "battleground," providing an opportunity for a candidate to pick up a single electoral vote in what otherwise might be hostile territory.  finally, utah moves back from "leaning republican" to being solidly being in trump's column.  there is no doubt that trump has improved his chances in the last several weeks and that he is extremely competitive in all of the remaining critical battleground states, but clinton's firewall is not yet showing any significant cracks and that is what makes trump's path to 270 electoral votes still quite challenging. for all of the endless talk about florida, ohio and north carolina, it is perhaps most important to keep your eye on clinton's performance in the states that are leaning her way, but not solidly in her camp. pennsylvania, colorado, michigan, and virginia are the core of clinton's current stronger and more viable path to 270. if trump begins to find significant inroads to any of those blue-leaning states, that will set off some alarm bells at her brooklyn hq and suggest a more viable path for trump. it is not enough for trump to simply win the remaining 70 electoral votes in the battleground states -- that only gets him to 266. he still needs to chip away at clinton's democratic leaning firewall. ohio poised to go down to the line on election day that's why we see both trump and clinton and their surrogates returning again and again to pennsylvania, for example. and that's why clinton and pro-clinton forces spent more than $16 million on television ads in the keystone state compared to the $5.3 million we've seen from trump and pro-trump forces. in fact, pennsylvania is the state with the third-highest number of ad dollars spent this cycle, behind only florida and ohio. clinton and trump will surely continue the fully engaged battle for the votes of floridians and ohioans, but until and unless trump can put one of those democratic leaning states back on the board as a battleground or even make one lean his way, clinton's electoral college advantage holds. solid republican: alabama (9), alaska (3), arkansas (6), idaho (4), indiana (11), kansas (6), kentucky (8), louisiana (8), mississippi (6), missouri (10), montana (3), nebraska (4), north dakota (3), oklahoma (7), south carolina (9), south dakota (3), tennessee (11), texas (38), utah (6)west virginia (5), wyoming (3) (163 total) leans republican: arizona (11), georgia (16), iowa (6), (33 total) battleground states: florida (29), nevada (6), ohio (18), maine 2nd congressional district (1) nebraska 2nd congressional district (1), north carolina (15) (70 total) leans democratic: colorado (9), michigan (16), new hampshire (4), pennsylvania (20), virginia (13), wisconsin (10), (72 total) solid democratic: california (55), connecticut (7), delaware (3), dc (3), hawaii (4), illinois (20), maine (3), maryland (10), massachusetts (11), new jersey (14), new york (29), oregon (7), rhode island (4), vermont (3), washington (12), minnesota (10), new mexico (5) (200 total) will mullery and tal yellin contributed to this story.      road to 270: cnn's latest electoral college map      
__label__0 washington (cnn)new york city mayor bill de blasio said thursday that republican presidential candidate donald trump is wrong in his assessment of stop-and-frisk, a policy that allows police officers to stop and pat down individuals they deem suspicious. "donald trump talks about stop-and-frisk like he knows the facts," de blasio told cnn's alisyn camerota on "new day." "he has had no experience with policing, no experience with public safety." trump touts stop-and-frisk practice amid black outreach "he should really be careful because if we reinstituted stop-and-frisk all over this country, you'd see a lot more tension between police and communities," added the mayor, a democrat who is supporting hillary clinton for president. if elected, trump said wednesday at a fox news town hall that he hopes to take the controversial policy nationwide to help stem "violence in the black community." "one of the things i'd do ... is i would do stop-and-frisk. i think you have to," trump said. "we did it in new york, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically." trump's comments came in response to an audience member's question about reducing "black-on-black crime." but many people in new york's black community have opposed the practice arguing that new york's police disproportionately used the policy to target and harass people of color. after ongoing protests of the policy, a federal judge ruled in 2013 that the nypd's stop-and-frisk policy violated citizens' constitutional rights. however, the judge did not order an outright ban on the practice, but called for outside oversight and reform. the city under mayor michael bloomberg appealed that ruling, but those efforts were dropped under de blasio's administration, and the city is participating in an ongoing reform and oversight process, which is supervised by a federal monitor. correction: an earlier version of this story misstated whether new york city is appealing the federal judge's 2013 ruling on stop-and-frisk. the city appealed the ruling at the time, but has since dropped that effort and is participating in an ongoing reform and oversight process.       new york mayor: donald trump wrong about 'stop-and-frisk'      
__label__0 washington (cnn)presidential elections are a state-by-state battle. but in two instances this november, it could be district by district. maine and nebraska are the only two states in the nation that don't have a winner-take-all system for their electoral college votes. that means that even if a candidate doesn't win the statewide popular vote in those states, they could pick up one or two electoral college votes if they win in congressional districts. and with an increasingly close election, both republicans and democrats see an opportunity to add purple to the map. brief civics lesson: you're not technically voting for president on nov. 8; you're voting for electors. it's those people -- 538 of them -- who technically pick the president. there's a math equation used to calculate how many electors each state gets: three electoral college votes based on the total number of us senators and us representatives it has (and three extras for the district of columbia). while individual electors may technically cast those votes for whomever they choose, it is virtually unheard of for a candidate who wins the popular vote in a state to not get all the electoral votes, and many states have laws enforcing that electors must respect the statewide vote. except, that is, in maine and nebraska, where things can get complicated. in those states, the votes are tallied by congressional district. the road to 270 in maine, which has two senators, two congressmen and so four electoral votes, the statewide winner automatically gets two votes. and then the winner of each of the two congressional districts gets one electoral vote, respectively. in nebraska, there are three congressional districts, meaning two votes go to a statewide winner and the three districts each award one electoral vote. so even if a candidate wins the majority of either state, maine could have a 3-1 split and nebraska could have a 4-1 or 3-2 split. this has almost never mattered -- but this year it might. if things get really close. they're not that close right now. hillary clinton has a strong advantage in the electoral college. but cnn rates one congressional district each in normally red nebraska and normally blue maine as a "battleground." maine has had the proportional system in place since 1972 and nebraska since 1991, and only once have the votes ever split. barack obama in 2008 got one electoral vote from deep red nebraska from the omaha area. the president reflected on the unprecedented feat from 2008 while visiting omaha in january. "that year, in the primary, i won the nebraska caucus, and there some people, i saw the signs calling the city 'obamaha,' and then in november of 2008, joe biden and i won the electoral vote," obama said during a trip to nebraska. "and then four years later i got whooped, all across this state." republicans in nebraska have tried to change the law but failed by one vote this april to switch back to a winner-take-all. both sides have their eyes on those single, accessible electoral votes. trump has paid attention to and campaigned in maine, a traditionally blue state in presidential years. he has reserved $47,000 in campaign ad time there from later this month through election day. clinton, on the other hand, has paid attention to nebraska, a traditionally red state in presidential years. she held an event with billionaire investor warren buffett in omaha in early august, and has spent more than $500,000 on ads in the omaha market. she has more than $120,000 reserved there through election day. polls have tightened since early august, when clinton had an advantage in many swing states that could have made for a landslide victory. since then, races in many states have been toss-ups, making every electoral vote important. cnn's gregory wallace and marshall cohen contributed to this report.      why two congressional districts could be key to this election

"the democratic party is going to have to adjust itself to their reality, rather than force young people to be adjusted to the democratic leadership's reality." sanders is currently wrapping up "our revolution," which will come out on november 15, one week after election day. it is being published by thomas dunne books. both that imprint and henry holt are owned by macmillan. the young adult edition will follow five months later. henry holt describes it as "an inspiring teen guide to engaging with and shaping the world — a perfect gift and important read."      bernie sanders working on young adult book      
__label__0 washington (cnn)donald trump's campaign is weighing in at the 11th-hour of negotiations on capitol hill over government funding -- and one key sticking point: whether to allow an international consortium to take over the assigning of website domain names. in an unusual alliance, trump is siding with texas sen. ted cruz, who is leading the push to prevent it from taking effect oct. 1. congressional sources tell cnn that trump's late effort to engage on this issue could throw the last-minute negotiations into flux. "the us should not turn control of the internet over to the united nations and the international community," trump's national policy director, stephen miller, said in a statement. "president obama intends to do so on his own authority -- just 10 days from now, on oct. 1, unless congress acts quickly to stop him. the republicans in congress are admirably leading a fight to save the internet this week, and need all the help the american people can give them to be successful." cruz has not endorsed his former rival for the gop presidential nomination, but tweeted out his thanks for trump's backing his efforts. "appreciate @realdonaldtrump's support of our efforts to keep the internet free." democrats have been skeptical of cruz's efforts, siding with tech firms like google and facebook who believe it will be better for the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers, based in los angeles, to take over domain names to improve information sharing across the internet. the internet issue is one of several matters that the two sides still are haggling over as part of the talks. they have until sept. 30 to reach a government funding deal, which will also include funding for zika. the senate gop had hoped to reach a deal this week in order to wrap up the session and let their vulnerable incumbents campaign. but business is expected to extend into at least next week.       trump sides with cruz over internet domains, possibly snagging spending deal      
__label__0 (cnn)ukrainian president petro poroshenko says he and donald trump missed a chance to meet this week due to scheduling problems -- a different version of events than put forward by a democratic senator. sen. chris coons of delaware said wednesday that poroshenko sought a meeting with the gop nominee during the united nations general assembly in new york but was ignored. "earlier this summer, i led a bipartisan delegation to eastern europe. we visited ukraine in particular, and i know president poroshenko of ukraine was seeking a meeting with donald trump while he was in new york meeting with the president of egypt, and was rejected," the delaware democrat told cnn "new day" host chris cuomo. but poroshenko says that's not how it happened. "we don't have any refusal," the ukrainian president said in an interview on cnn's "fareed zakaria gps," chalking it up to a scheduling conflict during a crammed few days of meeting with 22 heads of state. poroshenko said he didn't take the lack of a meeting with trump as a snub, citing bipartisan support in for his country in congress. earlier wednesday a ukrainian official confirmed to cnn that poroshenko's office requested a meeting with both trump and democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton but only received a response from clinton, who agreed to the meeting. a message left with trump's campaign wednesday was not immediately returned. trump did meet monday with egyptian president abdel fattah el-sisi, during which the two discussed "the strategic bilateral relationship between the us and egypt," according to a trump campaign statement after the meeting. clinton's meeting with poroshenko took place just a few minutes before trump met with el sisi a short distance away. before that meeting the democratic nominee said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges ukraine faces, primarily "the very real problems and threats from russian aggression." clinton added that she was "anxious to know how we can be supportive of those efforts." coons -- a vocal supporter of clinton for president -- was quick to link trump's decision not to meet with poroshenko to positive comments trump has made about russian president vladimir putin and his country, a primary geopolitical antagonist to ukraine. "donald trump's statements about ukraine and putin suggest a dangerous lack of familiarity with putin's actual record of invading a neighboring country and a dangerous lack of respect for or familiarity with our nato treaty alliances," he said. coons continued, "in meetings i had with heads of state in recent days here in new york city, they all expressed real concern or questions about donald trump's readiness or fitness to serve as president." trump's rhetoric on ukraine and russia throughout the us presidential election has prompted criticism and scrutiny, even from members of his own party. the gop nominee has praised putin as "a leader far more than our president has been a leader," and suggested that the united states shouldn't automatically come to the defense of nato allies in eastern europe who are threatened by an increasingly aggressive russia if those countries don't adequately fund their own militaries.       ukrainian president says he wasn't snubbed by trump; cites scheduling conflict

"yeah, that was tough," obama deadpanned, prompting laughs from the audience. colbert also asked the first lady if she was sympathetic to political spouses who are required to stand behind partners whose political beliefs are antithetical to their own -- a premise obama flatly rejected. "do you have any sympathy for the people who have to go there and stand by the person running for president?" "no," obama replied. "because if -- you know, you have to be, you know, in it. if you're in it, and if you don't agree, you should have agreed before they ran. bottom line is, if you didn't agree with what barack was saying, i would not support his run. so i stand there proudly, and i hope they are, too, standing with their spouses proudly. so no, no sympathy." during her appearance on the show, obama also joked around with colbert, climbing into a blanket fort with the host (a recurring segment on the show) to discuss serious issues, like investment in education for young girls around the world, and less serious ones -- such as when a conversation about healthy eating turned into a joke about how eating too many carrots can turn someone orange.

__label__0 washington (cnn)with two months to go before election day, democrats have the cash advantage in the race for the white house, but republicans have the cash advantage in the race for the senate. presidential campaigns and their supportive super pacs filed new numbers tuesday that continue to show clinton's cash lead in the homestretch of the presidential race. clinton's campaign raised $59.5 million and had about $68 million on hand at the end of august; trump's raised $41.7 million and had $50.2 million on hand. meanwhile, a cadre of republican donors -- most prominently, sheldon adelson -- are keeping republicans competitive in down-ballot races. here are the five takeaways from the money race: hillary clinton is very dependent on a few billionaires under-noticed in this campaign have been the very few democratic billionaires who are responsible for clinton's advertising machine: priorities usa. the super pac had a record-breaking month, collecting $23.4 million during summer's dog days. the bulk of the money is from a select few: fred eychaner and daniel abraham, who gave $3 million each, george soros, who donated $2.5 million, don sussman, who kicked in another $2 million, and laurene powell jobs, whose llc contributed another $2 million. those five people are responsible for a majority of the money that priorities usa has raised, and their names have littered democratic campaign finance reports for the entire 2016 race. trump doesn't have donors of similar sizes, and that's why his super pacs have failed to keep pace. only one new name appeared on trump's pac's reports: cherna moskowitz, who gave $1 million to a group run by close trump allies (and billionaires) bob and rebekah mercer. what's clinton's money good for? ads clinton has enjoyed a fundraising advantage over trump for the entire campaign, and it's allowed her to build an organization that trump could not. the democratic nominee spent almost $50 million last month -- way more than she spent during any other month -- and that's due to $33 million in "media buys." that's more than six times as much as they spent on payroll costs. and her campaign, joint fundraising committees and priorities usa had $194 million on hand, meaning plenty of more ads are coming. she's still struggling with small donors: only $8.4 million of the money she raised last month if from donors who gave $200 or less. trump is finally raising the big bucks despite record spending in the month of august -- including a hefty amount on its digital firm -- trump still entered the month with over $50 million on hand. trump collected $12 million from small-dollar donors who gave directly to his campaign, and he himself added another $2 million to his own bid. $20.2 million came from his joint committees with the republican national committee. trump finally began advertising in the month of august, and it's reflected in his campaign finance report. he spent almost $30 million last month, $11.5 million more than he spent in any other month. the return of mike bloomberg the former new york city mayor remains the most prominent political donor who hews to the center of the political aisle. his super pac, independence usa, has primarily focused on supporting candidates who support restrictions on firearms, and has emerged as a leading backer of pennsylvania sen. pat toomey. but he personally is backing the democratic ticket for president. the billionaire last month made his largest donation yet to his group: another $8.5 million from his personal fortune. that's his largest check ever to the super pac. senate republicans have the upper hand thanks to $21.5 million from the adelsons, groups backing senate republicans have more to spend in the homestretch than do those backing senate democrats. the senate leadership fund, an allied group in new hampshire, and the koch brothers' super pac, freedom partners action fund, raised $32.5 million in august. that also doesn't include various groups that aren't required to disclose their donors, such as the us chamber of commerce or other koch nonprofit groups. and the democrats? the main senate groups -- senate majority pac, emily's list and the league of conservation voters -- took in only $20.5 million. environmental activist tom steyer on tuesday pledged another $15 million to his joint effort with labor unions to develop a coordinated ground game for the democratic ticket. but here's what we do know now: the democrats don't have an adelson equivalent. their main senate donor last month is facebook co-founder dustin moskovitz, who along with his wife gave $5 million of the $20 million he has pledged to spend in 2016. in the senate cash race, adelson is a game-changer.       five takeaways from clinton and trump's big money month

"it is of great concern that the republican nominee for president has advocated u.s. withdrawal from the paris accord. a 'parexit' would send a clear signal to the rest of the world: 'the united states does not care about the global problems of human-caused climate change. you are on your own,'" the group wrote on the website responsiblescientists.org. the use of the term "parexit" is a reference to a political withdrawal along the lines of the uk's vote to leave the european union, commonly called the "brexit." they continued, "the consequences of opting out of the global community would be severe and long-lasting -- for our planet's climate and for the international credibility of the united states." the letter is signed by a number of famous scientists, including hawking and nobel prize-winning physicist steven chu, who served as secretary of energy under president barack obama. cnn reached out to the trump campaign for a response to the letter, but did not immediately receive a response. the paris agreement was reached by 195 countries at the united nations climate change conference in paris in 2015, aimed at coordinating global efforts to combat climate change. obama was a main proponent of the agreement, and democratic nominee hillary clinton supports its ongoing implementation. the group slammed politicians who deny the existence of man-made climate change. "during the presidential primary campaign, claims were made that the earth is not warming, or that warming is due to purely natural causes outside human control. such claims are inconsistent with reality," they wrote. republican nominee donald trump opposes the agreement, and he has previously suggested that climate change is a hoax "created by and for the chinese." he recently said in an interview that "i am not a great believer in man-made climate change."       stephen hawking, 375 scientists slam trump for backing 'parexit'      
__label__0 washington (cnn)rep. john lewis, a pioneer in the civil rights movement, wants the obama administration to appoint observers for the november election in certain states. "we should ask for federal protection," the georgia democrat said wednesday, warning "the election can be stolen on election day at polling places." lewis, who was badly injured in 1965 while marching in selma, alabama for voting rights for african-americans, said several states including georgia, florida, ohio and north carolina should be monitored, and potentially all of the states that belonged to the confederacy. lewis made his comments at a roundtable on voting rights with other democrats and advocacy groups held in the room in the capitol named after president lyndon baines johnson, who signed the landmark voting right law. in august, the supreme court denied a request from north carolina to allow provisions of its controversial voting rights law to go back into effect. the supreme court order meant provisions of the law -- concerning a tightening in voter id requirements, cutbacks on early voting and the preregistration of 16-year-olds -- will remain off the books for november's election. the court's order was a major victory for challengers to the law, including civil rights groups and the department of justice, which argued that it had a disparate impact on minority voters. lewis said the 2016 presidential election is the first since 1965 that voters don't have the full protections of the voting rights act due to a supreme court ruling three years ago. the lawmaker said it was a "shame and a disgrace" that congress hasn't acted on the issue. in 2013, the supreme court decided in a 5-4 decision that key parts of the voting rights act of 1965 are no longer valid. the opinion left it to congress to revise the law, so that it's constitutional in the minds of a majority of justices. chief justice john roberts explained the ruling saying "our country has changed" for the better. and that the conditions that moved congress five decades ago to require certain parts of the united states to "preclear" changes to voting laws "no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions."       john lewis calls for election observers at polling places this november      
__label__0 (cnn)even if their preferred candidate wins, a new poll released wednesday found that supporters of donald trump and hillary clinton will feel more relief than excitement. the findings from the pew research center revealed widespread disenchantment toward this year's presidential contest among american voters. majorities of voters say they are frustrated (57%) and disgusted (55%) with the campaign, dwarfing those who say they are interested (31%), optimistic (15%) and excited (10%). those lukewarm attitudes even extend to backers of the two major party nominees. only 25% of clinton supporters say they would feel excited if she were to win. there was little more enthusiasm among trump supporters; just 28% would be excited if the gop nominee triumphs in november. but many more clinton supporters, 68%, say they would feel relieved if she were to win. ditto for trump supporters, 61% of whom say they would also feel relief if he wins. according to pew, a mere 11% of voters overall say they would feel excited if trump were to win, virtually the same number (12%) who would be excited if the former secretary of state is victorious. the race between clinton and trump represents a battle between two of the least liked major party candidates in history, and pew's findings are hardly the first to show that voters are largely disappointed with both. a washington post/abc news poll last month found clinton and trump to be the two most unpopular presidential candidates in decades. the pew research center report is based on a random sample of 3,941 registered voters who are members of the center's american trends panel. respondents took the survey between august 16 and september 12 online or by mail, and were originally recruited via nationally representative telephone surveys. results among registered voters have a margin of sampling error of 2.6 percentage points.       pew poll: most voters 'frustrated,' 'disgusted' with 2016 election      
__label__0 orlando, florida (cnn)hillary clinton faces off against donald trump on the debate stage for the first time on monday night, in a crucial prime-time event that could alter the narrative of the presidential election just six weeks out from election day. cnn interviewed clinton supporters in orlando wednesday afternoon, at what is expected to be the democratic nominee's last public campaign event before the first debate. we asked what they think clinton needs to do to outperform trump, and what her biggest vulnerability might be under the spotlight. one woman said clinton should keep her cool if trump tries to provoke her. another urged clinton to stick to what she knows best -- policy. some clinton supporters expressed concern that trump will try to hit her on issues like the email controversy and benghazi. here's a look at their advice for the democratic nominee. pat fagan, 73, retired county parks and recreation director who lives in clermont, florida what does clinton need to do at the first debate? "she needs to continue being herself. i personally think how she handles herself with the public is the only way to go. getting up there and then calling each other names and so forth -- i don't think that gets you anywhere." what vulnerability do you think clinton has at the debate? "personally i don't really know of any vulnerabilities she has. i think she's going to win the election by at least 10 points. i think she is going to rip him a new one in the debate." patti fagan, 60, retired, lives in clermont, florida what advice do you have for clinton heading into monday's debate? "i would like her to listen to her own heart and not to be afraid of donald trump because he's just a punk. i just wish her well and i know he's going to ... anger her, he's going to try to antagonize her. i've seen him when he debates others and he gets really low and i just hope she remains high." what do you think will be clinton's biggest vulnerability at the debate? "her biggest vulnerability is she overthinks. she's trying to say everything so perfectly and so correctly that i think some people take that as -- they don't trust her, they feel that it's forced. ... don't overthink it because she's got it right and her instincts are right." mary sharpe, 73, retired, lives in lady lake, florida what does clinton need to do to have a successful first debate? "he's a pushover for baiting. i'd love to see her bait him into some crazy discussion. i think his tax returns, get him off on a tangent about his tax returns -- i think that'd be fun." what do you think will be clinton's biggest challenge at the debate? "i think he is probably going to go for the benghazi thing that they are trying to keep going. i don't think he will bring up the clinton foundation because now he's in trouble with his foundation. so i don't think he's going to go there." joe caldwell, 80, vietnam war veteran from orlando, florida what would you like to see clinton do at the first debate? "i would really like to see her (discuss) the health care issue, the (americans with disabilities act), the veterans and social issues -- those types of issues because there are so many veterans out there that can't get the care that they need not because they don't know where to go but because it's not available to them and it's pitiful." what do you think will be clinton's her biggest vulnerability at the debate? "i really hate to say this -- i do think that the most serious vulnerability is this thing that they keep bringing up that's history. like the tapes, like the cell phone issues ... that's history. let bygones be bygones. start anew. it's a new day! she can handle it. oh yes, she can handle it." david rucker, 70, retired from the orange county public schools and lives in orlando, florida what do you want to see from clinton at the debate? "what i'd like for her to talk about is the police department. i think that needs to get into depth a little bit more to try to get an understanding between the two: the community and the police and sheriff's department. we need to have that camaraderie and we don't ... there are too many young black males getting killed for no reason at all. i realize that they're real nervous sometimes when confronting us but there still has to be a better way." what do you think is clinton's biggest weakness? "i don't know if she's going to have a weakness ... i think she'll come out on top. i'm not worried at all. he's more of a reactionary guy and he'll try to follow hillary and i think she'll eat him up." brittany arroyo, 27, works at an engineering company and lives in melbourne, florida what is clinton's biggest strength as she head into her first debate against trump? "her biggest strength is her experience and intelligence. ultimately she knows the most about every political issues especially compared to donald trump. her level of experience just far outweighs almost any other political figure and even if she's not prepared for a question, she'll have plenty of knowledge on it." what will clinton's biggest challenge be at the debate? "unfortunately, i hate to say it, but as a woman i've seen it. she has to walk this fine line between being cute and likeable but also being tough and wise and intelligent and it's too hard -- you can never win. even though we'll be watching and we won't care if she smiles, i know a lot of republicans apparently do."       clinton supporters offer advice ahead of first debate      
__label__0 washington (cnn)the cast of "the west wing" is back -- but this time, instead of the fictional jed bartlet, they're backing a different democrat for president. members of the massively popular nbc drama will appear with democratic nominee hillary clinton at several events in ohio on saturday and sunday. actors richard schiff, allison janney, bradley whitford, dulé hill, joshua malina and mary mccormack will make campaign stops in the mahoning valley, cleveland, sandusky and toledo areas on saturday, and in the dayton and columbus areas on sunday. joss whedon's avengers take shots at trump in get out the vote video the actors will talk about why they're supporting clinton and encourage the public to register to vote, according to a campaign statement. this isn't the first time "west wing" -- the plot of which centers on a democratic presidential administration -- clashes with real life. janney, who played white house press secretary c.j. cregg, made an unexpected appearance in the white house press briefing room in april. the surprised press corps had been expecting actual white house spokesman josh earnest for their usual press briefing. the emmy award-winning show has been off the air since 2006, but remains popular even a decade later.       'west wing' cast to campaign for clinton      
__label__0 (cnn)the nation's billionaires -- energized by a presidential race heading down to the wire and led to believe that their money can tip the balance -- are digging deep. sheldon adelson has now pledged $45 million to republicans, with $20 million to the senate leadership fund announced this week. facebook co-founder dustin moskovitz this month promised $20 million to democrats. and michael bloomberg is likely to dedicate $15 million to his pro-gun control group that has backed both parties, cnn has learned. the investments come as the value of hefty fundraising and television advertising has been thrown into question this year thanks to donald trump's largely free-media driven campaign. meanwhile, the failure of big-money candidates like jeb bush and the ability of bernie sanders to raise tens of millions of dollars from small donors underscored questions about whether big money packs the same punch this election cycle as it once did. but as election day nears, many of the top 1 percent decided they still think their checks matter. "the fundraisers have been calling for a while. now we're all kind of settled back in, the summer's over, and you look up and, man, this election's right on top of ya," said steve mostyn, a democratic trial lawyer who gave $1 million to hillary clinton's super pac and is prepared to give another $1 million to it before the election wraps. mostyn, like other donors, said the increasing competitiveness of the presidential and senate races made him feel he needed to join in. in a non-competitive race, an extra million might just be gravy. so tom steyer, the billionaire environmental activist, committed another $15 million to his democratic super pac. the ricketts family of the midwest -- which financed substantial amounts of the barrage against donald trump during the republican primary -- is now organizing millions to support him. and a batch of out-of-nowhere megadonors -- whether it's pro-israel philanthropist cherna moskowitz on the right or hollywood filmmaker thomas tull on the left — are leaving their mark. too much, too late? and tv, or not tv? yet the biggest givers may have waited too long, depending on how they want to spend their money. with each passing week, the millions have smaller utility as advertising rates spike and early votes are cast. steyer is an exception, routing his millions to his own personal super pac, next gen climate action, along with a super pac co-run with a labor unions, for our future. both of the groups are funneling their money into a field program -- not paid media. "we believe in the traditional american democratic process where neighbors talk to neighbors about the most important issues affecting their lives," steyer said in a statement to cnn. "that's something you can't squeeze into a 15 second ad." the other rising democratic donor: moskovitz, who sent ripples through the donor world when he pledged $20 million to a variety of liberal and democratic party groups, but didn't give to clinton tv ad powerhouse priorities usa. moskovitz told cnn that he had "nothing more to announce" about any potential gift to priorities. while he is "primarily focused on the top" of the ticket, he described priorities as "distinguished by focusing on tv more than anything else." bloomberg, the former republican-turned-independent new york city mayor who has endorsed clinton, does not plan to give to priorities usa either, according to howard wolfson, a bloomberg political adviser. but he will likely end up spending $15 million for his independence usa, wolfson said. the group has already spent in senate races for republican incumbent pat toomey in pennsylvania and democratic challenger maggie hassan in new hampshire, and is assessing whether to air advertisements in other states, wolfson said. for the gop, the pro-trump, ricketts-led effort, is a bet that tv does indeed work. the ricketts are donating $1 million to their group, future 45, and hope to raise a total of $25 million in this campaign's closing weeks. they plan to run ads in six states with competitive senate races: florida, nevada, ohio, new hampshire, pennsylvania and iowa, according to the head of the pac, brian baker. it's unclear how many of the traditional donors that have been allied with the ricketts family are following them into the fray. future 45 was dormant for months after trump won the nomination. several major donors who have given to ricketts-led groups in the past did not respond to requests for comment wednesday about whether they would fund future 45. some, like home deport founder bernie marcus and former us senate candidate linda mcmahon, are publicly backing trump and looking for ways to give. others, like california investor bill obendorf and chicago hedge funder ken griffin, are not. offered a chance to say whether griffin planned to support the group, a griffin spokesman declined to comment. john jordan, a california vinter and large republican donor who has worked closely with the ricketts family, said he regarded their political operation as savvy and effective. but he said that the late infusion of cash would have little impact. "i feel bad for the people who wrote the checks," said jordan. "you can only spend so much effectively at the last minute." adelson's impact the decision by adelson to partner with the ricketts operation is a blow to the trump super pacs that have been trying to land him as a landmark donor. one group, rebuilding america now, has secured million-dollar checks from marcus thanks in part due to the fundraising skills of florida gov. rick scott, who leads the group. but many other well-heeled trump supporters are still on the sidelines. foster friess, the wyoming social conservative, told cnn earlier this month that while scott's "leadership is reassuring," he is not investing his dollars in the super pac. a second group run by a billionaire family close to trump, bob and rebekah mercer, appears to be in favor, and they won a new $1 million last month from moskowitz, a california philanthropist. she did not respond to a request for comment wednesday about her donation plans. the adelson's gift to the pro-trump effort -- likely to be around $5 million -- is substantially smaller than some had hoped, and the decision to relinquish control over their dollars to a separate donor family direct the effort is surprising. yet some democrats appear willing to go dollar-for-dollar with their republican rivals. mostyn, the democratic lawyer who is hosting tim kaine for a fundraiser later this week in houston, said he found the donation sizes of adelson and ricketts to be underwhelming, but that trump's recent strength has him more eager to return fundraising calls. "on my list of things to do today," mostyn said, "getting back to them has gone way up."       the billionaires strike back

__label__0 the axe files, featuring david axelrod, is a podcast distributed by cnn and produced at the university of chicago institute of politics. the author works for david axelrod. chicago (cnn)the republican party of 2016 has strayed so far from its principles that even ronald reagan would be unable to navigate his way through its thorny politics, according to michael steele, who was republican national committee chairman from 2009 to 2011 and is now a political analyst for msnbc. "ronald reagan, if he were a candidate running for any office today, would not win a republican primary," steele said to david axelrod on "the axe files" podcast, produced by the university of chicago institute of politics and cnn. "because the things that he would espouse, the policies, the values, the principles that he would lay out there, would be rejected," steele said, before describing reagan's position on taxes and immigration that would now be viewed as anathema to many republicans. instead of speaking to issues that have a real impact on people's lives, steele sees a republican party that's grappling with a nominee who uses his national platform to focus on "nonsensical" issues like president barack obama's birth certificate, a matter that steele bluntly called "bullshit racism." whether donald trump wins or loses in november, steele predicts that the tensions within the party will go unresolved. "the trump supporters will say, 'you didn't support him, that's why we lost.' that's a fight. the corporate class will say, 'god, why did we nominate him? that's why we lost.' (capitol) hill and the political class will say the same. the activists will be further dismayed and frustrated." but steele doesn't see this problem as being unique to republicans. he views bernie sanders's candidacy as a manifestation of a similar tension between establishment figures and a progressive faction that wants to pull the party further to the left. "the last time i checked, bernie sanders was not going away," steele said. "his millennial voters are pissed. they have transformed the party internally, operationally, through its (policy) platform. that is not hillary clinton's platform," steele said, before predicting, "more fun to come." to hear the whole conversation with steele, which also covered the racism he encountered during his 2002 campaign for lieutenant governor of maryland, his views on what it means to be a leader, and the lessons he applied from howard dean and obama that helped republicans capture the house in 2010, click on http://podcast.cnn.com. to get "the axe files" podcast every week, subscribe at http://itunes.com/theaxefiles.        former rnc chairman: reagan couldn't win today      
__label__0 delaware, ohio (cnn)this time of year in delaware, ohio they like a close race with plenty of mud and lots of noise. it's not the rollicking presidential race but the rough truck competition at the county fair. but even here, politics are never far away. across the midway in the merchants' barn, you'll find booths for both political parties. and just like the polls in ohio, the booths are pretty close -- maybe too close. "we had a life size cut out of hillary clinton but somebody took it," said a democratic volunteer. the volunteer wasn't pointing any fingers but this year the political shenanigans aren't limited to the fair grounds. in this key battleground state, both campaigns are reaching out to some very unlikely voters. for the trump campaign, that would be jeff hill. "yeah, donald trump"s who i'm voting for," hill said. 2016: last call for working class whites? he is a disaffected democrat, drawn by trump's promise to "make america great again." hill is exactly the demographic trump appeals to -- older, white and blue collar. census numbers show ohio has more voters like him than any other battleground state. it explains why trump is in ohio almost every week, showing up on traditional democratic turf like factory towns, coal fields even union halls. the republican nominee recently appeared at the canfield fair, ohio's largest county fair, where he drew a huge crowd in a county where republicans rarely get more than 35% of the vote. bob paduchik, trump's ohio campaign director, credits trump's message of security and fairer trade deals. "i think that resonates not just with republicans but also independents and democrats," he said. trump isn't the only one after non typical voters. donald trump: 'there's a lack of spirit between the white and the black' the clinton campaign has set its sights on suburban neighborhoods like powell just north of columbus, which is predominantly white, upper middle class and rich in republicans. the clinton campaign believes some voters here might side with the democratic nominee if they're unable to stomach the idea of voting for trump. some republicans don't need much selling. sherrie scarton has been a long time conservative voting for ronald reagan, john mccain and mitt romney. she even voted for ohio governor john kasich in the primary. but she is not voting for trump. "hillary's a smart woman and trump is just, i hate to say it, he's a maniac," she said. but paul beck, a political science professor at the ohio state university, isn't so sure this kind of political sniping is enough to win an election. he thinks many ohio voters haven't made up their minds how they will vote or even if they will vote at all. "what events occur between now and november 8th, what the debates look like what kind of terrorism activity -- there are all these kind of things that are out there in the firmament that can have an impact on what people end up doing in election 2016," beck said. when asked whether anyone has the buckeye state wrapped up, beck's answer was simple: "i don't think so."       ohio poised to go down to the line on election day      
__label__0 washington (cnn)new york city mayor bill de blasio said thursday that republican presidential candidate donald trump is wrong in his assessment of stop-and-frisk, a policy that allows police officers to stop and pat down individuals they deem suspicious. "donald trump talks about stop-and-frisk like he knows the facts," de blasio told cnn's alisyn camerota on "new day." "he has had no experience with policing, no experience with public safety." trump touts stop-and-frisk practice amid black outreach "he should really be careful because if we reinstituted stop-and-frisk all over this country, you'd see a lot more tension between police and communities," added the mayor, a democrat who is supporting hillary clinton for president. if elected, trump said wednesday at a fox news town hall that he hopes to take the controversial policy nationwide to help stem "violence in the black community." "one of the things i'd do ... is i would do stop-and-frisk. i think you have to," trump said. "we did it in new york, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically." trump's comments came in response to an audience member's question about reducing "black-on-black crime." but many people in new york's black community have opposed the practice arguing that new york's police disproportionately used the policy to target and harass people of color. after ongoing protests of the policy, a federal judge ruled in 2013 that the nypd's stop-and-frisk policy violated citizens' constitutional rights. however, the judge did not order an outright ban on the practice, but called for outside oversight and reform. the city under mayor michael bloomberg appealed that ruling, but those efforts were dropped under de blasio's administration, and the city is participating in an ongoing reform and oversight process, which is supervised by a federal monitor. correction: an earlier version of this story misstated whether new york city is appealing the federal judge's 2013 ruling on stop-and-frisk. the city appealed the ruling at the time, but has since dropped that effort and is participating in an ongoing reform and oversight process.       new york mayor: donald trump wrong about 'stop-and-frisk'

__label__0 (cnn)a six-year-old boy from new york has won the respect of us president barack obama and thousands of others after he offered to take in omran daqneesh, a little boy who was injured after his home in aleppo, syria, was bombed. the image of five-year-old omran sat alone in an ambulance, covered in dust and blood, shocked the world and inspired six-year-old alex, from scarsdale, new york, to take action. in a handwritten letter sent to the white house, alex asked obama to go and collect omran and bring him to his house where "we will be waiting for you guys with flags, flowers, and balloons." alex said that omran could be part of his family, and offered to be his brother. he said he would teach him how to speak english, to ride a bike and added that his sister catherine would share her toys with him. obama read alex's words aloud in a speech he gave at the united nations earlier this week, before posting a video of alex reading the letter himself to facebook. in his message, obama asked people to read the letter to "understand why he had decided to share it with the world." "those are the words of a six-year-old boy -- a young child who has not learned to be cynical, or suspicious, or fearful of other people because of where they come from, how they look, or how they pray," the president wrote. "we should all be more like alex. imagine what the world would look like if we were," he added. read more: omran, a vivid reminder of war's horror at the time of writing the post has collected more than 100,000 "likes" and been shared more than 60,000 times, with many facebook users praising the compassion shown by alex. one facebook user wrote: "a six-year-old who has more humanity, love, and understanding than most adults. kudos to his parents and i know the world will see more great things coming from alex." another added: "i heard this earlier today, as read by my president. even with that pre-conditioning, made me cry while reading it just now. neither of these sweet little boys, someone's sons, are skittles." donald trump jr., the son of the republican presidential nominee, sparked controversy monday when he compared syrian refugees to a bowl of skittles candies.

__label__0 washingtonsince we last updated the cnn battleground map, donald trump has clearly improved his poll numbers both in some national polls and in some critical battleground states. the republican nominee has also upped his game (as have his allied outside group friends) with television ad spending.  and, yet, hillary clinton maintains her advantage on the road to 270 when it comes to piecing together the electoral math needed to win the presidency. why two congressional districts could be key to this election with four days to go before the highly anticipated first presidential debate and just under 7 weeks before all the votes are cast, hillary clinton still sits above that key threshold in the latest cnn outlook. when you add up all the states either solidly or currently leaning clinton's way, she has 272 electoral votes in her column in our new estimate. what's changed? -- iowa (6) moves from from "battleground" to "lean republican" -- utah (6) moves from "lean republican" to "solid republican" -- maine's 2nd congressional district (1) moves from "solid democrat" to "battleground" -- nebraska's 2nd congressional district (1) moves from "solid republican" to "battleground" explore the map and make your choices road to 270: electoral college map note: the split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines. the state of play donald trump has improved his standing in our electoral college outlook due to iowa (a state barack obama won twice) and its six electoral votes moving from the true toss-up "battleground" category into the "lean republican" category, giving trump a total of 196 electoral votes either solidly or leaning in his favor.  that leaves 70 electoral votes up for grabs across four states (plus two congressional districts) -- florida, nevada, ohio, and north carolina.  maine and nebraska award individual electoral votes by congressional district in addition to the multiple electoral votes based on statewide results. both maine and nebraska's second congressional district have moved into battleground status in this latest estimate. maine's second congressional district has moved from "solid democrat" to "battleground" and nebraska's second congressional district has moved from "solid republican" to "battleground," providing an opportunity for a candidate to pick up a single electoral vote in what otherwise might be hostile territory.  finally, utah moves back from "leaning republican" to being solidly being in trump's column.  there is no doubt that trump has improved his chances in the last several weeks and that he is extremely competitive in all of the remaining critical battleground states, but clinton's firewall is not yet showing any significant cracks and that is what makes trump's path to 270 electoral votes still quite challenging. for all of the endless talk about florida, ohio and north carolina, it is perhaps most important to keep your eye on clinton's performance in the states that are leaning her way, but not solidly in her camp. pennsylvania, colorado, michigan, and virginia are the core of clinton's current stronger and more viable path to 270. if trump begins to find significant inroads to any of those blue-leaning states, that will set off some alarm bells at her brooklyn hq and suggest a more viable path for trump. it is not enough for trump to simply win the remaining 70 electoral votes in the battleground states -- that only gets him to 266. he still needs to chip away at clinton's democratic leaning firewall. ohio poised to go down to the line on election day that's why we see both trump and clinton and their surrogates returning again and again to pennsylvania, for example. and that's why clinton and pro-clinton forces spent more than $16 million on television ads in the keystone state compared to the $5.3 million we've seen from trump and pro-trump forces. in fact, pennsylvania is the state with the third-highest number of ad dollars spent this cycle, behind only florida and ohio. clinton and trump will surely continue the fully engaged battle for the votes of floridians and ohioans, but until and unless trump can put one of those democratic leaning states back on the board as a battleground or even make one lean his way, clinton's electoral college advantage holds. solid republican: alabama (9), alaska (3), arkansas (6), idaho (4), indiana (11), kansas (6), kentucky (8), louisiana (8), mississippi (6), missouri (10), montana (3), nebraska (4), north dakota (3), oklahoma (7), south carolina (9), south dakota (3), tennessee (11), texas (38), utah (6)west virginia (5), wyoming (3) (163 total) leans republican: arizona (11), georgia (16), iowa (6), (33 total) battleground states: florida (29), nevada (6), ohio (18), maine 2nd congressional district (1) nebraska 2nd congressional district (1), north carolina (15) (70 total) leans democratic: colorado (9), michigan (16), new hampshire (4), pennsylvania (20), virginia (13), wisconsin (10), (72 total) solid democratic: california (55), connecticut (7), delaware (3), dc (3), hawaii (4), illinois (20), maine (3), maryland (10), massachusetts (11), new jersey (14), new york (29), oregon (7), rhode island (4), vermont (3), washington (12), minnesota (10), new mexico (5) (200 total) will mullery and tal yellin contributed to this story.      road to 270: cnn's latest electoral college map      
__label__0 (cnn)donald trump reacted to the turmoil in charlotte this week by lamenting "a lack of spirit between the white and the black," adding that "it's very divided, our country, and it's getting worse, so i'm not overly surprised to see it." in an interview on "fox and friends" thursday morning, trump pointed to the violent protests over the fatal police shooting of an african-american man in charlotte as an example of frayed relationships between law enforcement and minority communities across the country. "it just seems that there's a lack of spirit between the white and the black. i mean, it's a terrible thing that we're witnessing," he said. "you are seeing it, i'm seeing it, and you look at what went on last night in charlotte, a great place, and you just see it. there's somewhat -- and i see it even going out. there's such a lack of spirit. there's a lack of something, something that's going on that's bad, and what's going on between police and others is getting worse." trump had also discussed the tension between police and the communities they serve in a pre-taped town hall that was set to air on fox news wednesday night, but which was preempted by coverage of the charlotte protests. during the town hall, trump proposed expanding the use of the controversial "stop-and-frisk" program by police. "i think you have to," the republican nominee said at the town hall. "we did it in new york, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically." trump elaborated on his call for "stop-and-frisk" in the interview on "fox and friends" thursday morning, saying he was only referring to expanding its use to chicago, where he said gun violence was particularly severe. "(former nypd commissioner) ray kelly did a great job, and new york was not in a chicago situation, but it was really in trouble," trump said. "but stop-and-frisk worked. we had tremendous shootings, numbers of shootings. now chicago is out of control. i was really referring to chicago stop-and-frisk. they asked me about chicago." under stop and frisk, police stop people on the street who they deem suspicious and then search them on the spot for guns and drugs, among other things. new york city's stop-and-frisk program was mired in controversy, leading to numerous complaints that the practice led to racial profiling. a federal judge ruled in 2013 that the program was unconstitutional because it unlawfully targeted blacks and latinos, although stop and frisk was not banned. trump also expressed doubts about the ability of cities like charlotte to build trust in divided communities. "if you look at dallas, there was a dialogue," trump said, referencing the murder of five dallas police officers by a sniper over the summer after videos showing two african-american men shot by police in louisiana and minnesota spurred protests and debate over police use of force across the country. "they prided themselves on dialogue, and they were constantly talking and meeting and having community groups. and that was a pretty tough situation, to put it mildly."       donald trump: 'there's a lack of spirit between the white and the black'      
__label__0 (cnn)sen. jeff sessions pilloried former president george h.w. bush's decision to support hillary clinton for president over donald trump, saying the bush family "should remember the loyalty they were given by millions of americans." sessions expressed frustration with republicans who've refused to back trump in an interview with the washington examiner published wednesday. a long-serving republican senator, he was among the first members of the so-called gop "establishment" to throw his support behind the eventual nominee during the primary, and has been a fixture of the trump campaign since. "they should objectively analyze who is likely to advance best the agenda they favor and the agenda the republicans who supported them favored. and that's clearly donald trump," sessions said. the alabama republican also noted that "millions of americans, including this one, worked their hearts out for the bushes in 1988, 1992, 2000, and 2004. and it wasn't bill clinton that helped the bushes get elected. it was the same voters, in large part, that elected ronald reagan and stand to elect donald trump." the elder bush is the only member of the family whose support for clinton has become public. jeb bush, whom trump defeated during the primary, has said he won't support the nominee, and former president george w. bush has declined to reveal his presidential preference. for sessions, though, the choice is simple, and he expressed puzzlement about the bush family. related: ivanka trump huddles with female republican members of congress in washington "i think they're not thinking clearly enough about this," sessions told the washington examiner. "they're not ... appreciating half the american people, virtually, that have been supportive of republicans. a lot of them preferred somebody other than bush candidates, but they rallied around them when it came to november. so i would hope that we see more rallying." and to other republicans, like texas sen. ted cruz or ohio gov. john kasich, who have argued trump isn't conservative enough to lead the party, sessions says "that's ridiculous." "at this point in history, it's the william f. buckley test -- who is the most conservative candidate that can win the presidency? hillary clinton or donald trump? on taxes, on regulations, on judges, on law enforcement — all these are conservative positions. what is the problem here? i just feel on issue after issue he's been firmly in the conservative, classical republican conservative view." related: the gop's next civil war is brewing       sessions knocks bushes: 'they should remember the loyalty they were given'      
__label__0 (cnn) hillary clinton sat down for an interview with the irreverent zach galifianakis and almost immediately -- albeit jokingly -- regretted it. clinton sat down with the comedian on september 9, the day her doctor diagnosed her with pneumonia. clinton, who was introduced as "had pneumonia" at the start of the video, plays along with galifianakis' off-color humor and shows a bit of comedy herself. "when you see how well it works for donald trump, do you think to yourself, oh maybe i should be more racist," the comedian asks clinton, who just shakes her head and laughs. galifianakis also knocks clinton for going to trump's 2005 wedding to melania trump. "when you went to donald trump's wedding, did he write his own vows? and did michelle obama write melania's," the comedian says, a joke about how trump's wife plagiarized the first lady in her speech to the republican national convention. the interview is part of the clinton campaign's attempt to show a funnier, softer side of the former secretary of state. led by kristina schake, clinton's deputy communications director, the effort has seen clinton do a number of non-traditional interviews like the one with galifianakis. galifianakis opened the interview with, "critics have questioned some of your decision making recently and by you doing this show i hope it finally puts it to rest." clinton deadpanned, "i think it absolutely proves their case, don't you?" clinton is not the first politician to sit down with galifianakis. president barack obama also sat down with the comedian in 2014 to tout the affordable care act. related: the backstory to the obama-galifianakis funny or die video nodding to the historic significance of clinton's candidacy, the comedian joked that while she could be the first female president, "for a younger, younger generation, you will also become their first white president and that is pretty neat, too." trump was not spared during the interview. galifianakis also asked if clinton will lead the civil war if trump wins. clinton says, "no, i wouldn't take up arms. i think that might be a little extreme." "oh right, because you were saying before we were rolling that you wanted to take away everyone's guns. very cool," galifianakis jokes. "i really regret doing this," clinton says. after implying that clinton's pantsuits make her look like a "librarian from outer space," galifianakis also asks cllinton what she thinks trump will wear to the debate. "i assume he will wear that red power tie," clinton says. "or maybe like a white power tie," galifianakis says. "that is even more appropriate," clinton adds. the over 5-minute interview closes with a joke about clinton's email controversy. "well, this has been a lot of fun mrs. clinton," clinton says. "we should stay in touch. what is the best way to reach you? email." clinton responds by staring the comedian down.       hillary clinton goes between two ferns: 'i really regret doing this'

__label__0 (cnn)even if their preferred candidate wins, a new poll released wednesday found that supporters of donald trump and hillary clinton will feel more relief than excitement. the findings from the pew research center revealed widespread disenchantment toward this year's presidential contest among american voters. majorities of voters say they are frustrated (57%) and disgusted (55%) with the campaign, dwarfing those who say they are interested (31%), optimistic (15%) and excited (10%). those lukewarm attitudes even extend to backers of the two major party nominees. only 25% of clinton supporters say they would feel excited if she were to win. there was little more enthusiasm among trump supporters; just 28% would be excited if the gop nominee triumphs in november. but many more clinton supporters, 68%, say they would feel relieved if she were to win. ditto for trump supporters, 61% of whom say they would also feel relief if he wins. according to pew, a mere 11% of voters overall say they would feel excited if trump were to win, virtually the same number (12%) who would be excited if the former secretary of state is victorious. the race between clinton and trump represents a battle between two of the least liked major party candidates in history, and pew's findings are hardly the first to show that voters are largely disappointed with both. a washington post/abc news poll last month found clinton and trump to be the two most unpopular presidential candidates in decades. the pew research center report is based on a random sample of 3,941 registered voters who are members of the center's american trends panel. respondents took the survey between august 16 and september 12 online or by mail, and were originally recruited via nationally representative telephone surveys. results among registered voters have a margin of sampling error of 2.6 percentage points.       pew poll: most voters 'frustrated,' 'disgusted' with 2016 election      
__label__0 washington (cnn)donald trump's supporters on capitol hill said thursday they know the stakes are high for monday night's debate and could set the tone for the sprint to election day. "donald trump knows, the team knows that monday night is going to be not necessarily make or break, but the momentum coming out of monday night could be critical on both sides and donald trump knows that," said rep. chris collins, a new york republican, as he walked out of what could be the final meeting of trump's congressional supporters. "he's likely to bring up some clinton issues. i think we're going to see some give and take there," collins said. "we all know mr. trump is a little quicker on his feet than mrs. clinton." the group met for close to an hour at the republican national committee headquarters and discussed the trump campaign's plan for battleground states as well, but the debate prep stood out in the meeting led by top trump advisers. collins, the first congressman to endorse trump and an early leader of efforts to rally highly reluctant house republicans to trump's side, said that he will be flying to new york monday to help the trump campaign after the debate against democratic nominee hillary clinton in the media spin room. "donald trump knows that monday night is absolutely critical," he said. "and i think with that in the back of his mind, i'm confident we'll see presidential trump monday night." clinton supporters offer advice ahead of first debate shortly after collins talked thursday, the trump campaign sent out a debate prep survey to supporters, asking them what issues he should focus, whether he should attack clinton's policies or defend his own and more. "do you think trump should refer to hillary as 'crooked hillary' on stage?" trump asked, in question #4 of the 30-question survey. questions about trump's use of charitable donations to pay off personal legal debts have hounded him this week, but collins dismissed them and tried to put the focus back on the clinton foundation, which has been a source of consternation across the aisle. "i'm sure there will be these kinds of volleys, we'll hear more about, but the fact of the matter is trump's foundation made donations to not-for-profit, 501(c)3s -- that's what foundations do. and i think the more important question, or issue is there's no trump family members being paid by the foundation," collins said. "it's not a patronage pit like the clinton foundation is." how to watch the first presidential debate collins said trump's hill supporters also got an update on the battleground plans, with just six weeks left in the race, and said they are confident trump has multiple paths to the 270 electoral votes needed to win. "there are six different ways for him to get to 269, he's right now leading in iowa, nevada and new hampshire, that takes him to 269, he might win one in maine, there's 270, he might lose one in nebraska, he's back to 269," he said. collins cited other states in play -- colorado, michigan, wisconsin, pennsylvania, virginia -- that could tip the balance to trump. the focus now, he said, has turned from rallying conservatives to winning over independent and undecided voters. "it's all about the undecideds, they don't like hillary clinton, they don't like her with her character flaws, they haven't warmed up to president trump and that's where the debate is going to be so critical monday night for president trump to address the nation for all those people who want no part of hillary clinton."       hill backers: donald trump knows debate stakes      
__label__0 (cnn)an ohio county chair for the trump campaign resigned following an interview published thursday, in which she suggested there was "no racism" until president barack obama was elected, and called the black lives matter movement "a stupid waste of time." kathy miller -- who is white -- resigned from her position, which the trump campaign said was a volunteer job, and apologized for the "inappropriate remarks," according to a statement from the trump campaign. "my personal comments were inappropriate, and i apologize," miller stated. "i am not a spokesperson for the campaign and was not speaking on its behalf. i have resigned as the volunteer campaign chair in mahoning county and as an elector to the electoral college to avoid any unnecessary distractions." miller told the guardian in an interview that she blamed obama for exacerbating racial tension. "if you're black and you haven't been successful in the last 50 years, it's your own fault. you've had every opportunity," miller told the publication. "i don't think there was any racism until obama got elected. we never had any problems like this," miller said. "now, with the people with guns and shooting up neighborhoods and not being responsible citizens, that's a big change, and i think that's the philosophy obama has perpetuated on america." miller also wholly rejected the premise of systemic racism. "you've had the same schools everybody else went to. you had benefits to go to college that white kids didn't have. you had all the advantages and didn't take advantage of it. it's not our fault, certainly," she said. the trump campaign announced that tracey winbush, an african-american radio host, will take over miller's duties. according to a 2013 census report, black voters voted at the highest rate of any race in the 2012 presidential election.       trump ohio county chair resigns after comments on race, obama

"there was an altercation that occurred after he got the pie in the face," sgt. bryce heinlein, a sacramento police spokesman, told cnn. "there were some punches thrown, and then the subject was quickly taken to the ground by one of the officers that is on the mayor's security detail" and some event attendees, heinlein said. thompson was arrested and faces felony charges of assaulting a public official, sacramento police said. the sacramento fire department transported him to a local hospital after the scuffle. a booking photo shows him with two sets of stitches around a blackened left eye. crystal strait, johnson's chief of staff, was on hand for the incident wednesday night, and described a briefly chaotic scene. she said in an email that "the mayor was attacked and grabbed him from behind and struck with what we afterwards learned was a pie from an unknown man. he reacted in self-defense like most people do when attacked by an unknown object." she that johnson "did not have any significant injuries," though one staffer was receiving medical care thursday for a minor injury that occurred while helping to restrain thompson. the mayor, who was a star point guard for the phoenix suns in the late 1980s through the 1990s, addressed the incident on twitter, saying: "appreciate everyone. i'm doing fine. thank you to sac pd for being there. be safe everyone."       sacramento mayor punches pie thrower

"i don't have an answer for you because it's not something that i've familiarized myself with -- the constitutionality of it, its efficacy, whether (it) worked well in new york city or not," ryan said after being pressed twice by reporters on the policy the gop nominee wants to revive, despite court rulings finding it unconstitutional. ryan called for calm following the shooting in charlotte, saying about the unrest in the city overnight, "these images are just so heartbreaking and they are upsetting." "the loss of any life is a tragedy. the response to that though cannot be more violence. as leaders, it is responsibility to promote calm, peace and dialogue. we cannot allow our nation to be divided up along racial lines and so i hope leaders can come together to find solutions," ryan said. clinton, trump navigate politics of police violence the house speaker repeatedly brushed back reporters' efforts to have him weigh in on the law enforcement policy that trump said he wanted to implement. "i haven't given enough thought to it," ryan said initially about "stop and frisk," and added, "we need to do more to stop home grown jihadism." he touted his "better way" agenda and then shifted to stressing that law enforcement has used their own strategies, "i think there are success stories that local law enforcement have used to guard against this and that's the kind of ideas we need to have." earlier this week ryan said he wanted congress to complete work on a major criminal justice reform bill. but at his weekly news conference he made it clear he didn't want to comment on the gop nominee's proposal saying it wasn't an area where he had expertise, referring reporters to judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte.       house speaker paul ryan ducks on stop-and-frisk      
__label__0 washington (cnn)rep. john lewis, a pioneer in the civil rights movement, wants the obama administration to appoint observers for the november election in certain states. "we should ask for federal protection," the georgia democrat said wednesday, warning "the election can be stolen on election day at polling places." lewis, who was badly injured in 1965 while marching in selma, alabama for voting rights for african-americans, said several states including georgia, florida, ohio and north carolina should be monitored, and potentially all of the states that belonged to the confederacy. lewis made his comments at a roundtable on voting rights with other democrats and advocacy groups held in the room in the capitol named after president lyndon baines johnson, who signed the landmark voting right law. in august, the supreme court denied a request from north carolina to allow provisions of its controversial voting rights law to go back into effect. the supreme court order meant provisions of the law -- concerning a tightening in voter id requirements, cutbacks on early voting and the preregistration of 16-year-olds -- will remain off the books for november's election. the court's order was a major victory for challengers to the law, including civil rights groups and the department of justice, which argued that it had a disparate impact on minority voters. lewis said the 2016 presidential election is the first since 1965 that voters don't have the full protections of the voting rights act due to a supreme court ruling three years ago. the lawmaker said it was a "shame and a disgrace" that congress hasn't acted on the issue. in 2013, the supreme court decided in a 5-4 decision that key parts of the voting rights act of 1965 are no longer valid. the opinion left it to congress to revise the law, so that it's constitutional in the minds of a majority of justices. chief justice john roberts explained the ruling saying "our country has changed" for the better. and that the conditions that moved congress five decades ago to require certain parts of the united states to "preclear" changes to voting laws "no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions."       john lewis calls for election observers at polling places this november

"we need a president in good health, and the results of donald trump's latest physical show he is ready to lead," the email reads. a link allows supporters to "commit to be healthy too" by ordering their official sweatband, which starts at $12. trump's also known for having fast food delivered to his plane after events, tweeting out a picture of him last month eating kfc on his plane (with silverware). but despite the lack of exercise and high consumption of fast food, trump's doctor has said in the past that if elected, trump would be "healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency." the trump campaign declined to comment on whether the republican nominee planned to wear the sweatband on the trail, just as he's done with his "make america great again" hat.       trump, who says he does not exercise, offering 'make america great again' sweatbands

__label__0 (cnn)secretary of state john kerry launched a blistering attack on russia wednesday for its actions in syria, pointing to the bombing of a un aid convoy that left more than 20 dead and its inability to stop continued syrian air attacks. kerry spoke immediately after russian foreign minister sergei lavrov at a united nations security council meeting in new york about the five-year syrian war. "i listened to my colleague from russia and i sort of felt like we're in a parallel universe here," kerry said of their differing accounts of the conflict. he called for all planes in key areas of syria to be immediately grounded and for countries to stop supporting those who sabotage ceasefire efforts.  kerry also questioned how the us-supported opposition can engage in political talks to resolve the conflict when the syrian regime, backed by russia, doesn't halt its attacks. russia was tasked with restraining syria during this latest attempt at a ceasefire, undertaken last week. related: us blames russia for syria convoy attack; moscow points to terrorists  "how can people go sit at a table with a regime that bombs hospitals and drops chlorine gas again and again and again and again and again and acts with impunity," kerry asked. "you're supposed to sit there and have happy talk in geneva while the regime drops bombs?" russian denial the diplomatic clashing of swords highlights just how hard it has been to take even the first steps toward calming the syrian conflict enough to begin political talks. the ongoing civil war has given terror groups like isis and al-qaeda fertile recruiting ground, has sucked in regional powers seeking influence over the outcome and has sent ripples through europe and its allies. as diplomats sparred at the security council, russian minister of defense sergei shoigu said that moscow was sending an aircraft cruiser to the mediterranean to strengthen its capabilities there.   the russians have denied that they were behind the attack on the un convoy and instead have offered a series of explanations that kerry detailed at the security council meeting.. russia initially said that the strike was a necessary response to an alleged offensive by an al-qaeda-linked terror group, kerry said. then russia claimed they were bombing elsewhere, then that the aid convoy had been followed by militants with mortars, and then that the trucks caught fire. "the trucks and the food and the medicine just spontaneously combusted," kerry said. "anybody here believe that?" he asked. the bombing attacks on hospitals and children are "flagrant violations of international law," he added. and attacks on civilians and humanitarian workers continue, kerry noted. he cited separate air strikes on monday that killed four aid workers near aleppo. "there are only two countries that have planes that are flying during the night or flying in that particular area at all," kerry said. "they are russia and syria."   'thorough and impartial' investigation at the security council wednesday, lavrov said russia always put as a top priority the resumption of the inter-syrian political dialogue without any preconditions. and he called for a "thorough and impartial" investigation into monday's bombing, which left the convoy of trucks in a twisted wreck of smoking metal. and he urged his counterparts at the meeting to "refrain from emotional comments." us officials have fingered russia as the perpetrator of the attack based on intelligence and reports from the ground. kerry cited eyewitnesses who said that "all of a sudden, the place became hell and the fighter jets were in the sky." the white house said publicly tuesday night that it held russians responsible, regardless of whether it or the syrian government had launched the strikes, since they have responsibility for the airspace. "we have not seen good faith. this was an outrageous action," said deputy national security adviser ben rhodes. syrian ambassador to the un bashaar jaafari hit back, saying it was "laughable" for kerry to cite eyewitness accounts when, he claimed, "thousands of people" in the area hadn't seen any jets. he also took the us to task for an airstrike on satruday that killed 62 syrian soldiers, calling it a "deliberate and unacceptable aggression." the us has said it was an accident. kerry's scathing 28-minute speech to the security council also pressed the need to return to a 2012 plan to create a political transition in syria. he pointed to repeated syrian attacks on civilians, detailed shifting russian explanations about the aid convoy attack and ridiculed moscow's argument that political talks shouldn't be burdened with preconditions. the us has said that russia bears responsibility for the attack on the convoy because they were the only two countries flying planes over the area at that time and russia had pledged to restrain syria. "the primary question is no longer what do we know," kerry said. "the primary question is, collectively, what are we going to do about it? in other words, this is a moment of truth." washington, moscow clash lavrov needled the us over opposition groups during his address. washington and moscow have clashed over russian targeting of moderate syrian opposition groups backed by the us. the russians have claimed that some of these groups are not particularly moderate and have accused opposition groups of violating the ceasefire.  on wednesday, lavrov called for all members of the international syrian support group to ensure that the opposition groups over which they have influence will comply with the cessation of hostilities. otherwise, he added, "we can't preserve syria as a single, united state."  and he alluded to "geopolitical engineering," a reference to russian concerns about us attempts at "regime change." syria's jaafari echoed the argument, telling the meeting that the international syrian support group was "formed outside international legitimacy" and was "reminiscent of other destructive coalitions that only brought disasters to countries like iraq and libya and yemen." the only success the us has managed to achieve, jaafari said, is to level "false accusations" about the "suffering of syrians to demonize the syrian government and its allies." four failed ceasefires kerry had left the meeting before the syrian ambassador spoke, but when jaafari had finished speaking, ambassador michele sison, the us deputy representative to the un, asked to address the council. "my colleagues are entitled to their own opinions but not to their own facts," sison said. "let's just keep in mind just who is prolonging the suffering of the people of syria." jaafari's remarks had been "so full of untruths that i feel no need to say anything further," she said. for his part, earlier in the meeting, kerry mocked lavrov's argument that there should be no preconditions before political negotiations start. citing four international-level agreements calling for a cessation of hostilities that could then lead to peace talks, kerry said, "that's not a precondition. that's an international agreement, four times arrived at." related: obama at un warns americans against walls and nationalism "four times, it's been shredded by independent actors," kerry said, "by spoilers who don't want a cease-fire." half of syria's population has been uprooted, many of them fleeing to europe, and well over 300,000 men, women and children have been killed, un secretary general ban ki-moon told the meeting.   "those who believe the crisis in syria cannot become even worse are dead wrong," kerry said, "as are those who believe there's a military solution."       john kerry launches blistering attack on russia at un      
__label__0 cleveland heights, ohio (cnn)donald trump said wednesday he was "very troubled" by the fatal police shooting late last week in oklahoma of an unarmed black man and suggested the officer in question "got scared" or was "choking." trump offered his first public reaction to the shooting during an event at the church of pastor darrell scott, a black supporter who asked trump for his reaction to the police shootings of black men in tulsa, oklahoma, and charlotte, north carolina. trump began his response by praising police and noting he has been endorsed by several law enforcement groups, but added that "you always have problems." "you have somebody in there that always makes a mistake, that's bad or that chokes," trump said, using a term he often uses to describe somebody who falters under pressure. related: tulsa police shooting investigated by justice department trump did not address tuesday's shooting in charlotte of keith lamont scott, who police say was armed at the time he was fatally shot, but the republican nominee did describe the video of the shooting of terence crutcher in tulsa. crutcher was unarmed when he was shot by a police officer. "i must tell you, i watched the shooting in particular in tulsa and that man was hands up, that man went to the car -- hands up -- put his hand on the car. to me, it looked like he did everything you're supposed to do," trump said. "and he looked like a really good man -- and maybe i'm a little clouded because i saw his family talking about him after the fact ... but he looked like somebody who was doing what they were asking him to do." "this young officer, i don't know what she was thinking. i don't know what she was thinking, but i'm very, very troubled by that and we have to be very careful," trump said, referring to the officer who fatally shot crutcher. the officer, betty shelby, is 42 years old. trump questioned whether shelby got "scared" or if she was "choking." "did she get scared? was she choking? what happened? but people that choke, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing," he said. trump's remarks on the shooting came as he delivered a speech to a group of pastors focused on his plans to help minority communities as president and one day after he argued that african-american communities are "in the absolutely worst shape that they've ever been in before. ever. ever. ever." related: obama: would be 'personal insult' to legacy if black voters don't back clinton trump did not address the tulsa shooting during the two rallies he hosted on tuesday, after the department of justice announced it would investigate the shooting for possible civil rights violations. moments before taking the stage wednesday, trump tweeted about the latest shootings: "the situations in tulsa and charlotte are tragic. we must come together to make america safe again."       trump 'very troubled' by oklahoma fatal police shooting      
__label__0 new york (cnn)president barack obama confronted one of his most strained foreign partnerships wednesday during a final meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, the pair making a last attempt at patching up their stormy bond before obama leaves office. speaking before their session, obama said he was aiming to ascertain the prospects for peace in the region as he prepares to end his presidency. "our hope will be that in these conversations we get the sense of how israel sees the next few years, what the opportunities are and what the challenges are in order to ensure we keep alive the possibility of a stable, secure israel at peace with its neighbors," obama said. "these are challenging times. one thing that i would say about prime minister netanyahu is that he is always very candid with us." that candor has become a hallmark of the relationship between obama and his israeli counterpart, whom the white house has accused of being less-than-diplomatic in expressing his opposition to us policies like the nuclear agreement with iran. obama's 30-minute meeting wednesday with netanyahu was likely to be their final opportunity for face-to-face consultations before a new president enters the oval office in january. obama is intent on conferring solid ties with israel upon his successor, despite the personal animus that developed between him and netanyahu, as he looks to boost the relationship during the homestretch of a presidential campaign in which he hopes to see democratic nominee hillary clinton prevail. obama took a step toward solidifying the alliance this month by completing a long-term, $38 billion security aid package for israel, the largest such agreement ever for a us ally. the aid, obama said, "allows the kind of certainty in a moment where there's enormous uncertainty in the region. it is a very difficult and dangerous time in the middle east and we want to make sure israel has full capabilities to keep the israeli people safe." in their talks, obama said he and his israeli counterpart would discuss challenges in syria, and said he would get netanyahu's assessment of conditions in israel and the west bank. "clearly there is great danger of not just terrorism but also flare-ups of violence," he said. "we do have concerns about settlement activity as well." obama hopes to take steps in his final days in office to promote renewed talks between the israelis and the palestinians on peace, though his previous efforts toward reconciliation in the region have fallen short. "my hope is we can continue to be an effective partner in israel in finding a path to peace," obama said. but the white house remains opposed to israel's expanded settlement activity in the west bank, and has expressed disappointment at netanyahu's occasional skepticism about the viability of a two-state solution in the region. in the meeting wednesday obama raised "profound us concerns about the corrosive effect that that is having on the prospects of two states." "they've never papered over their differences," another senior administration official said of obama and netanyahu. in his final united nations address tuesday, obama made scant reference to the israel-palestine conflict, saying only that "israelis and palestinians will be better off if palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of israel, but israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle palestinian land." the passing remark was in stark comparison to the large amounts of time obama spent on the issue during addresses to the un earlier in his tenure. the shift reflected the now-frozen peace negotiations, which moved in spurts during obama's presidency but never materialized into a workable solution. the white house has conceded that talks aren't likely to resume while obama remains in office but has remained open to the possibility the president could take steps in the next months to ramp up pressure on both sides to work toward a two-state solution. "with respect to middle east peace, i wouldn't rule out the president taking any particular step on the issue," ben rhodes, obama's deputy national security adviser, said tuesday. "what i would say is his test has always been, can i make a positive difference by engaging on the israeli-palestinian issue? we've tried multiple tactics, none of them have succeeded, given the fact that the parties themselves have been unable to come together." obama's talks with netanyahu wednesday capped a tumultuous personal history, though both displayed a businesslike camaraderie during their photo-op. the low point between the two men came in march 2015, when netanyahu infuriated the white house by publicly lobbying against the iran nuclear deal before congress -- a move the administration lambasted as a breach of diplomatic protocol. netanyahu returned to washington last november in an attempt to repair the relationship, meeting with obama in the oval office and addressing both the conservative american enterprise institute and the left-leaning center for american progress, the think tank with ties to clinton. netanyahu on wednesday invited obama for a round of golf in israel once he departs office in january, saying warmly that obama's "influential voice" on international politics would remain a force "for many decades." "our alliance has grown decade after decade, through successive presidents, bipartisan congresses and with the overwhelming support of the american people," he said. "it is an unbreakable bond."       obama at netanyahu meeting: 'he is always very candid with us'      
__label__0 (cnn)ukrainian president petro poroshenko says he and donald trump missed a chance to meet this week due to scheduling problems -- a different version of events than put forward by a democratic senator. sen. chris coons of delaware said wednesday that poroshenko sought a meeting with the gop nominee during the united nations general assembly in new york but was ignored. "earlier this summer, i led a bipartisan delegation to eastern europe. we visited ukraine in particular, and i know president poroshenko of ukraine was seeking a meeting with donald trump while he was in new york meeting with the president of egypt, and was rejected," the delaware democrat told cnn "new day" host chris cuomo. but poroshenko says that's not how it happened. "we don't have any refusal," the ukrainian president said in an interview on cnn's "fareed zakaria gps," chalking it up to a scheduling conflict during a crammed few days of meeting with 22 heads of state. poroshenko said he didn't take the lack of a meeting with trump as a snub, citing bipartisan support in for his country in congress. earlier wednesday a ukrainian official confirmed to cnn that poroshenko's office requested a meeting with both trump and democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton but only received a response from clinton, who agreed to the meeting. a message left with trump's campaign wednesday was not immediately returned. trump did meet monday with egyptian president abdel fattah el-sisi, during which the two discussed "the strategic bilateral relationship between the us and egypt," according to a trump campaign statement after the meeting. clinton's meeting with poroshenko took place just a few minutes before trump met with el sisi a short distance away. before that meeting the democratic nominee said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges ukraine faces, primarily "the very real problems and threats from russian aggression." clinton added that she was "anxious to know how we can be supportive of those efforts." coons -- a vocal supporter of clinton for president -- was quick to link trump's decision not to meet with poroshenko to positive comments trump has made about russian president vladimir putin and his country, a primary geopolitical antagonist to ukraine. "donald trump's statements about ukraine and putin suggest a dangerous lack of familiarity with putin's actual record of invading a neighboring country and a dangerous lack of respect for or familiarity with our nato treaty alliances," he said. coons continued, "in meetings i had with heads of state in recent days here in new york city, they all expressed real concern or questions about donald trump's readiness or fitness to serve as president." trump's rhetoric on ukraine and russia throughout the us presidential election has prompted criticism and scrutiny, even from members of his own party. the gop nominee has praised putin as "a leader far more than our president has been a leader," and suggested that the united states shouldn't automatically come to the defense of nato allies in eastern europe who are threatened by an increasingly aggressive russia if those countries don't adequately fund their own militaries.       ukrainian president says he wasn't snubbed by trump; cites scheduling conflict      
__label__0 washington (cnn)a brewing civil war within the gop has house republicans picking sides, with plenty of members backing up party chairman reince priebus in threatening consequences for those who don't get behind nominee donald trump. "any person in this party that does not support trump at this point is increasing the chances of hillary clinton becoming president and destroying the constitution," arizona rep. trent franks told cnn wednesday. "therefore they are betraying this party. they are betraying the constitution." franks had endorsed texas sen. ted cruz in the primary. the rancor comes after priebus, the chairman of the republican national committee, said sunday on cbs' "face the nation" that if trump opponents don't "get on board," it's not "going to be that easy for them" to run for office again. the remark appeared to be directed at former presidential candidates like cruz, ohio gov. john kasich, and former florida gov. jeb bush, who all have refused to endorse trump after signing a pledge to do so during the primary campaign. priebus' comments prompted pushback, including from top kasich strategist john weaver, who retorted that kasich "will not be bullied by a kenosha political operative that is unable to stand up for core principles or beliefs." the gop's next civil war is brewing but house republicans had priebus' back. while none discussed explicit penalties for future candidates based on their opposition to trump, they warned that there would be political consequences. "having on your resume that you were all in against the nominee -- (with a) record number of votes won fair and square -- having on your record that you were against the nominee is not a positive for future political aspirations," said nevada rep. mark amodei. several prominent republicans in addition to the former candidates have publicly said they won't back trump. on tuesday, sources said that former president george h.w. bush had told kathleen hartington kennedy townsend that he would be voting for clinton. sources: bush 41 says he'll vote for clinton clinton has also been endorsed by republicans including hp ceo and former california gubernatorial candidate meg whitman; a top adviser to arizona sen. john mccain, mark salter; and former george w. bush administration commerce secretary carlos gutierrez. former gop nominee mitt romney has also spoken forcefully against trump, though he has not endorsed clinton. and current sitting lawmakers -- including illinois sen. mark kirk, south carolina sen. lindsey graham and florida rep. carlos curbelo -- have said they will not vote for the brash real estate mogul. kirk and curbelo are both facing reelection. on wednesday, curbelo brushed off the idea that he is hurting his party. "every american has to make the best choice for their country," curbelo told cnn. "jack kemp said you serve your party best by serving your country first, that's what i do here every day." but curbelo's colleagues maintained he will have to face the voters' reaction to his opposition to the party's standard-bearer. "there's already some unrest among republicans that there are some who have chosen not to get behind their nominee, the person they picked," said pennsylvania rep. lou barletta. "i can sense that as we travel around, and i think that will be lasting." "i do anticipate there will be some type of reaction to that," said tennessee rep. marsha blackburn, referring to priebus' threat. trump has been endorsed by the republican leaders in the house and senate, but the relationship has been strained. though they support voting for trump, both senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and house speaker paul ryan have continued to on occasion criticize him publicly. the house's no. 2 republican didn't fully back priebus' comments on tuesday, saying threats were not good motivation to come together. "there's a better way to unite people. i'm not a big believer that punishment unites people," house majority leader kevin mccarthy told reporters. "if hillary (clinton) can't unite republicans, i don't think anything can."       hill republicans frustrated with gop disunity over trump      
__label__0 (cnn)it's becoming an election year tradition: senate minority leader harry reid is hammering away at the republican presidential nominee on his taxes. reid took to the senate floor wednesday, taunting and ridiculing donald trump for not disclosing his tax returns. the reason for trump's refusal is simple, reid said. "because trump's tax returns would further destroy his presidential candidacy," said reid, who made mitt romney's tax returns a major election issue four years ago. trump has insisted for months that he cannot release his tax returns because he is under audit by the internal revenue service; alternatively, his campaign has said that voters do not much care about the issue. it is not a requirement for presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns, but it is an enduring tradition. for the last 40 years, virtually every major party nominee has released his or her tax returns. (gerald ford released a summary in 1976.) tax experts have said that an audit does not preclude trump from releasing his returns. on wednesday, reid dismissed trump's explanation, saying the real estate mogul is "not known for caution or restraint." "he is the most unhinged and reckless presidential candidate ever," reid said. instead, reid said the real reason for trump's failure to disclose the returns is due to the political damage they would inflict on his campaign. "production of his tax returns would prove again that he is a fraud," reid said. the retiring nevada senator said the tax returns would show that trump is "not the billionaire he claims to be" and a "welfare king" who is "mooching off the american taxpayer." trump campaign spokeswoman hope hicks did not respond to a request for comment. it was the second time in as many days that reid has torched trump over his taxes. and it's become a familiar role for reid, who excoriated romney for refusing to release some of his tax returns in the 2012 presidential race. romney released a 20-year summary of his tax liabilities from 1990 until 2009, as well as his tax returns from 2010 and 2011, but he did not release the returns from previous years. reid, without proof, accused romney of going a decade without paying federal income taxes. four years later, reid and romney are now on the same side of the issue. in february, romney speculated publicly that trump's tax returns would reveal a "bombshell." trump fired back on twitter that month, claiming romney "didn't show his tax return until september 21, 2012, and then only after being humiliated by harry r!" on wednesday -- four years to the day that romney released his 2010 and 2011 tax returns -- reid found himself with an unlikely ally. "mitt romney and i agree on one thing, and that's one thing for sure," reid said on the senate floor. "and that is that donald trump should release his tax returns."       harry reid cites romney as ally in hitting trump on tax returns

__label__0 washington (cnn)new jersey governor and donald trump surrogate chris christie called hillary clinton "a disgrace" after she connected recent police shootings to "systematic racism" -- hours after the gop nominee said he was "very troubled" by a recent incident in oklahoma. "she's a disgrace. she's a disgrace and those comments are a disgrace," christie said wednesday on "the laura ingraham show." "it's typical of hillary clinton. she knows nothing but the mouth never stops." trump, however, has also displayed a tendency to speak about events before all the facts are made clear. he notably called the explosion in new york city over the weekend a "bomb" 30 minutes after the incident, despite a lack of official confirmation. ingraham played comments clinton made tuesday on "the steve harvey show" following the shooting of terence crutcher, a 40-year-old unarmed black man shot dead by police in tulsa, oklahoma. "and we've got to tackle systemic racism -- this horrible shooting again," clinton said. "how many times do we have to see this in our country? in tulsa, an unarmed man with his hands in the air? i mean, this is just unbearable, and it needs to be intolerable. and so maybe i can, by speaking directly to white people, say, look, this is not who we are." trump, speaking wednesday in cleveland heights, ohio, at a minority voter outreach event, also expressed concern about the shooting. "i must tell you, i watched the shooting, in particular in tulsa, and that man was hands up, that man went to the car -- hands up -- put his hand on the car. to me, it looked like he did everything you're supposed to do," trump said. "and he looked like a really good man -- and maybe i'm a little clouded because i saw his family talking about him after the fact ... but he looked like somebody who was doing what they were asking him to do." christie -- speaking hours after clinton condemned the shooting death of keith lamont scott in charlotte, north carolina -- said the former secretary of state doesn't know enough about policing to draw any conclusions. "the fact is she has no idea what happened in north carolina," he said. "the same way, as you very aptly pointed out laura, people jumped to conclusions in ferguson, which caused riot conditions in ferguson, because of politicians dumping gasoline on a fire." the clinton campaign has said she hopes to develop national best practices for police to help them manage situations like those in tulsa and charlotte. but christie, a former federal prosecutor, said clinton had "no experience in law enforcement except for being interviewed by them." "i'm just appalled, and as someone who spent seven years in law enforcement, she's exactly the kind of politician that law enforcement loathes, loathes her," christie added.

__label__0 san francisco (cnn)hillary clinton has moved away from the donor circuit after an august of nonstop fundraising, ceding that role to her running mate tim kaine, who's getting some celebrity help as well. since september 1, kaine has headlined 25 fundraisers in 12 states and washington, dc, while clinton has only held eight. kaine continued his fundraising blitz on wednesday in california with multiple events in the bay area, including a luncheon featuring two long-time republican donors. thursday, he's in houston for an event that features singer michael bolton. this is bolton's second fundraiser for clinton; he appeared at an event during the democratic primaries. the texas tribune first reported bolton's appearance. the houston event is part of kaine's cash-raising spree. kaine appeared wednesday at the atherton home of jillian manus, a republican donor, philanthropist and businesswoman. the event will be co-hosted by hp ceo meg whitman, who ran for california governor as a republican in 2010. whitman endorsed clinton in august, writing in a statement that she would vote for and donate to clinton. according to average ticket prices and attendance figures provided by the clinton campaign, kaine has raised over $16 million in september, as of wednesday. clinton has raised around $13 million by the same standard. clinton also canceled her trip to california earlier this month after she was diagnosed with pneumonia. the change comes after an august where both clinton and kaine focused more on fundraising than they did on campaigning. the democratic duo headlined 70 fundraisers in august (37 for clinton, 33 for kaine). the events raised over $80 million, according to cnn's estimate. clinton aides say that august will be the high-water mark for clinton personally headlining events. while she will continue to headline events, one aide said more of the load would continue to fall on kaine. the change is one that donors have long expected and were somewhat surprised it didn't happen in august. even if clinton was a more prolific fundraiser in august, kaine hit the ground running on the fundraising circuit after he was named clinton's running mate in july. to date, the former virginia senator has headlined 58 fundraising events and raised closed to $30 million. clinton still remains a far bigger draw than kaine, with many of her fundraisers costing tens of thousands of dollars to attend. but kaine has headlined his share of top dollar fundraisers. an event at the los angeles home of cynthia and charles hirschhorn on tuesday raised $1.4 million. charles hirschhorn, a movie producer who worked on "bull durham" and "dirty rotten scoundrels," was housemates with kaine in their student days at harvard law school. on monday, kaine headlined a "latinos for hillary" event at the los angeles home of actress eva longoria. kaine also headlined an event tavern on the green, the historic new york restaurant in central park, where five donors paid a whopping $500,000 to dine with the vp candidate. in all, the intimate event raised $2.5 million. kaine, a former chairman of the democratic national committee, was tapped as clinton's running mate, in part, because of his ability to raise the money needed to compete in a presidential election. while other factors like his preparedness and ability to win over white working-class voters were key factors in clinton's decision to pick kaine, aides said in july that the virginia senator was the best fundraiser being considered.       michael bolton headlines clinton event as tim kaine picks up the fundraising slack      
__label__0 new york (cnn)breaking news: barack obama vetoed friday a bill that would allow family members of 9/11 victims to sue saudi arabia. the white house claimed it could expose us diplomats and servicemen to litigation in other countries. republican and democratic leaders in congress say they'll override obama's veto next week. obama has now issued 12 vetoes. if successful, congress' override will be the first of obama's presidency. original story: a clash between the white house and congress appears likely at the end of this week as president barack obama prepares to reject a measure allowing victims' families and survivors of the september 11 attacks to sue the government of saudi arabia. support for the "justice against sponsors of terrorism act" ran high among lawmakers, who overwhelmingly passed the bill after pressure from victims' groups. the bill passed with enough support to indicate lawmakers could override the president's expected veto. but in recent days some of the measure's supporters have expressed misgivings about the legislation, prompting a new effort by the administration to lobby against the bill. the white house hasn't specified when obama will officially veto the measure, which he's vowed to reject claiming it could open us diplomats and service-members to lawsuits. the 10-day window for the president to submit his rejection closes on friday, and the white house is hoping to keep its options open by waiting until nearer the deadline. administration officials had been eying a friday afternoon veto, which would have come after congress was expected to adjourn until november's election contests. but prolonged negotiations over a government funding bill and a package to combat zika virus have delayed the recess, meaning lawmakers are still likely to be in washington next week to cast an override vote. a person familiar with the administration's thinking said that friday afternoon still appeared the most likely period for the veto to come down. that would maximize time for white house officials to press members of congress to reconsider support for the measure. "white house officials and other senior officials on the president's national security team have engaged members of congress and their staffs in both parties in both houses," white house press secretary josh earnest told reporters in new york on tuesday. he wouldn't disclose when obama planned to veto the bill. "as soon as the president has put pen to paper, we'll be sure and let all of you know," earnest said. the republican leaders of the senate and house have both said in recent says that an override is expected to go through, despite new qualms about the bill. if successful it would be the first veto override of obama's presidency. "our assumption is that the veto will be overridden," senate majority leader mitch mcconnell told reporters on tuesday. house speaker paul ryan followed suit wednesday, saying "i do think the votes are there for the override." but the wisconsin republican also voiced his own doubts about the legislation, saying the implications for lawsuits against americans worried him. "i worry about legal matters," ryan said. "i worry about trial lawyers trying to get rich off of this. and i do worry about the precedence. at the same time, these victims do need to have their day in court." he was one of several prominent lawmakers who have expressed buyers' remorse for the proposed law. a pair of republican senators, bob corker of tennessee and lindsey graham of south carolina, have pushed for changes to make it more difficult for the families to pursue lawsuits but could also make it harder for the us to be sued for alleged wrongdoing. opponents of the bill gained support wednesday from the european union, which issued its opposition in the form of a "demarche" statement to the us department of state. "the european union is of the view that the possible adoption and implementation of the jasta would be in conflict with fundamental principles of international law and in particular the principle of state sovereign immunity," the eu statement read. "the european union considers that the adoption of the bill and its subsequent implementation might also have unwanted consequences as other states may seek to adopt similar legislation, leading to a further weakening of the principles of state sovereignty immunity." the document called on obama to reject the bill. cnn's ted barrett contributed to this report from washington      obama vetoes 9/11 bill      
__label__0 washington (cnn)isis is suspected of firing a shell with mustard agent that landed at the qayyara air base in iraq tuesday where us and iraqi troops are operating, according to several us officials. the shell was categorized by officials as either a rocket or artillery shell. after it landed on the base, just south of mosul, us troops tested it and received an initial reading for a chemical agent they believe is mustard. no us troops were hurt or have displayed symptoms of exposure to mustard agent. us officials said tuesday that additional testing had definitely concluded that a mustard agent was not used in the attack. last week, another official had said the agent had "low purity" and was "poorly weaponized." a second official called it "ineffective." a us defense official said troops had gone out to look at the ordnance after it landed. based on seeing what they thought was a suspect substance, two field tests were conducted. the first test was positive and the second was negative, the official said. the substance is now being sent to a lab for further examination. decontamination precaution us troops involved in the incident went through decontamination showers as a precaution. no troops have shown any symptoms of exposure, such as skin blistering. cnn has reported on previous instances where isis has fired rounds with mustard agents in iraq and syria. "i don't know of a case like this where it was proximate to us forces like this before," said one military official, noting that "potentially" the rocket round was "within hundreds of yards" of the us forces and "within the security perimeter" of the base. the us officials said they "had expected" that isis might try use chemical weapons as us and iraqi forces push towards mosul in an effort to take the city back from isis. several hundred us troops are using the base as a staging area for supporting iraqi forces. all of this has led the pentagon to assess on a preliminary basis that it was isis that fired at the base, since the terror group has been making mustard agent for some time. in the course of its air campaign against isis, us airstrikes have hit several locations the us believes are production sites for mustard agent. us officials emphasized that mustard agent is relatively easy to produce, and they continue to hit suspected manufacturing sites when they find them. us troops are routinely outfitted with protective gear in the event of a chemical weapons attack. cnn's ryan browne contributed to this report.      isis suspected of mustard attack against us and iraqi troops      
__label__0 orlando (cnn)hillary clinton kicked off a campaign event wednesday by saying that the recent police killings of two african-american men that unleashed a national uproar this week are "unbearable" and "intolerable." clinton used those words the day before to describe last week's shooting death of terence crutcher in oklahoma, but revisited the issue wednesday in light of the death of keith lamont scott in north carolina. her comments -- which came at the beginning of a lengthy speech about improving economic opportunities for disabled americans -- marked her first on-camera remarks on the shootings, which have again sparked a debate about lethal police force. "there is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. but we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of african americans killed by police officers in these encounters," clinton said. "it's unbearable. and it needs to become intolerable." the democratic nominee added: "i know i don't have all the answers. i don't know anyone who does. this, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have." even as she referred to the deaths as "two very upsetting incidents," clinton also urged the public against channeling their anger by targeting police officers as she pointed to the protests that unfolded tuesday night. "every day, police officers across our country are serving with extraordinary courage and honor and skill," she said. "i've spoken to many police chiefs and other law enforcement leaders who are as deeply concerned as i am, and deeply committed, as i am, to reform. why? because they know it's essential for the safety of our communities and our officers." the racially charged issue of the deaths of black civilians in confrontations with the police has taken center stage multiple times in the 2016 election, and wednesday was not the first time that the clinton has commented on the issue. this week, scott -- a father of seven -- was killed by police in a parking lot when police officers were searching for another man to serve a warrant. his family has said that scott was unarmed and reading a book in his car, but the charlotte-mecklenburg police says that scott came out of the car with a gun. in tulsa, oklahoma, last week, crutcher was killed in a confrontation with police officers. crutcher was unarmed, and videos of the incident shows crutcher standing next to his car and falling to the ground after an officer shot him. the officer's attorney later said she was afraid crutcher was trying to reach for a weapon. clinton's republican opponent, donald trump, also reacted to crutcher's death on wednesday, saying in ohio that he was "very troubled" by the fatal shooting. "i must tell you, i watched the shooting in particular in tulsa and that man was hands up, that man went to the car -- hands up -- put his hand on the car. to me, it looked like he did everything you're supposed to do," trump said. "this young officer, i don't know what she was thinking. i don't know what she was thinking, but i'm very, very troubled by that and we have to be very careful."       clinton on police shootings: 'too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have'      
__label__0 washington (cnn)the senate wednesday rejected a bipartisan proposal to block a pending $1.15 billion united states arms sale to saudi arabia. critics of the military deal, which was approved by the obama administration last month, complained it could drag the us into the saudi-led war in yemen and contribute to the worsening humanitarian crisis there. the measure to disapprove the sale failed on a 26-71 vote. the outcome, which was a victory for saudi arabia, came as the us-saudi relationship is being carefully examined and managed by restive lawmakers. congress will vote in the coming days in favor of another highly sensitive matter the saudis strongly oppose. lawmakers are expected to override president barack obama's veto of a bill that would allow victims and families of the 9/11 terrorist strikes to sue saudi arabia for its alleged role in them. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell , r-kentucky, aware of the potentially conflicting signals congress is sending the saudis, cited the importance of strong us-saudi ties in explaining why he voted against the blocking the sale. "i oppose that motion because i believe it would harm our nation's long term strategic interests in the persian gulf and the broader middle east," he said. "it would further damage our alliance and partnership with the kingdom of saudi arabia at a time when our moderate sunni arab allies are questioning whether our nation is able to meet our traditional commitment to the region. the resolution would also ignore the shared interests we have with saudi arabia in combatting al qaeda and isil." a coalition of liberal and conservative senators pushed the resolution to scrap the sale. sen. rand paul, r-kentucky, argued that by selling tanks and other military equipment to saudi arabia the us is essentially joining the war in yemen without congressional authorization. "we are complicit and actively involved with war in yemen. there's been no debate in congress, really no debate in the public sphere, over whether or not we should be at war in yemen," paul said. "we are currently doing inflight refueling of bombers, saudi arabian bombers that are bombing in yemen. we are helping to select sites and we actually have had special forces involved in these decisions in the theatre as well." sen. chris murphy, d-connecticut, warned america would be blamed for humanitarian disaster in yemen and could lead to a backlash against the us. "there have already been thousands and thousands of civilians killed," said murphy. "if you talk to yemenis, they will tell you that this is perceived inside yemen as not a saudi-led bombing campaign, which it's broadly advertised in the newspapers, but as a us bombing campaign or at best a us-saudi bombing campaign. there is a us imprint on every civilian death inside yemen, which is radicalizing the people this country against the united states." senior gop senators active in foreign policy matters -- such as senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker of tennessee, sen. john mccain of arizona and sen. lindsey graham of south carolina, opposed blocking the sale. they argued that a strong saudi arabia provides a critical counterweight to the aspirations of iran in the middle east. "the middle east is a very complicated place," graham said. "but here's what's not complicated: saudi arabia shared intelligence with us that's made americans safe. they have allowed us to use their air bases in time of conflict. they are all-in against isis and they are a great ally against the ambitions of the iranians. to those who wish to sever the this relationship, be careful what you wish for."       senate rejects bid to block us-saudi arabia arms deal      
__label__0 orlando, florida (cnn)hillary clinton's aides wanted their candidate to start talking more about policy and less about trump. on wednesday, clinton did just that. the democratic presidential nominee forcefully argued in favor of giving people with disabilities an equal chance at success during an event here, saying defending the disabled would be "a vital aspect of my presidency." the speech offered implicit contrast with trump -- who last year memorably mocked new york times reporter serge kovaleski, whose arthrogryposis impairs the movements in his arms. but clinton entirely ignored the republican nominee during the event, never using his name in the roughly 30-minute speech. wednesday's speech was clinton's fourth in a series of addresses where the former first lady is attempting to talk more about her values and proposals and less about trump. clinton's past "stronger together" speeches on faith, community service and children and families have been far more focused on trump. wednesday's address, instead, lived up to what clinton's aides had hoped the series of speeches would be: more policy than politics. clinton said people with disabilities are "invisible, overlooked and undervalued" and that the united states is "falling short" in protecting their rights. "we've got to face that and do better -- for everyone's sake," clinton said. "because this really does go to the heart of who we are as americans." clinton added that as president, she would do away with the subminimum wage, urge congress to ratify the united nations convention on the rights of persons with disabilities and launch a program to help with autism in the workplace. "people with disabilities shouldn't be isolated. they should be given the chance to work with everyone else. and we're going to eliminate the subminimum wage, which is a vestige from an ugly, ignorant past," clinton said of laws that allow employers to pay people with disabilities less than the minimum wage. some advocates for the disabled, however, have feared that the elimination of the subminimum wage would diminish hiring of disabled workers. jennifer mizrahi, the president of respect ability, an advocacy organization for people with disabilities, said the speech was the first time a presidential candidate has dedicated an entire campaign event to the disabled. people with disabilities are usually the "poorest of the poor," mizrahi said, noting that around 400,000 disabled people work in "sheltered work shops where they can pay subminimum wages, as little as 20 cents an hour." the activist also suggested the clinton's struggles would be helped by focusing on people with disabilities. "we span every demographic," she said. "a lot of white people with disabilities." clinton is beating trump with latino and african-american voters, but lagging behind the republicans with white voters, especially those without a college degree. cnn's jeanne sahadi contributed to this report.      clinton ignores trump, delivers speech on helping disabled      
__label__0 washington (cnn)michigan democratic rep. sander levin called on the irs wednesday to audit the trump foundation, following a report that the billionaire used charity money to pay off legal settlements. "it is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes, rather than promote the business ventures of those affiliated with the charity. i therefore request an immediate audit of the donald j. trump foundation," levin wrote in a letter to irs commissioner john koskinen. the washington post reported earlier this week that trump used $258,000 from his charity to pay off settlements in a pair of lawsuits. the post reported that trump used the charity to pay for a $100,000 settlement with the city of palm beach in 2007 and used another $158,000 from his charity to settle a lawsuit filed in 2011 about a hole-in-one claim at a charity golf tournament. the revelation immediately drew accusations from democrats of trump self-dealing. messages left with the trump campaign and the irs were not immediately returned wednesday. but new jersey gov. chris christie, a top trump surrogate, warned hillary clinton's campaign wednesday of using the allegations against the trump foundation for a political attack. "be careful what door you open, mrs. clinton, because you're not going to want people to be talking about the clinton foundation and comparing it to anything that donald trump has done in his life, including giving away tens of millions of his own personal money," christie, who is chairing trump's transition efforts, told radio host laura ingraham. koskinen was on capitol hill on wednesday fielding a barrage of questions from house republicans at a hearing before the judiciary committee. house conservatives are pushing articles of impeachment to get rid of the commissioner over his handling of allegations that agency members targeted tea party groups, but it's unlikely any vote will happen before the fall election. trump, meanwhile, has broken with decades of modern presidential politics in refusing to release his personal tax returns, saying that he is being audited by the irs. cnn's deirdre walsh contributed to this report.      dem congressman to irs: audit the trump foundation      
__label__0 toledo, ohio (cnn)donald trump wants to take the controversial policy of stop-and-frisk to chicago. trump touted the much-maligned program during a fox news town hall that was pre-taped for wednesday night but didn't air, responding to a question about how he would stem "violence in the black community." he clarified on "fox and friends" thursday morning that he was specifically proposing expanding the program only to chicago, highlighting the city's gun violence epidemic and comparing the situation to new york in the 1990s. "(former nypd commissioner) ray kelly did a great job and new york was not in a chicago situation, but it was really in trouble. it was in bad shape, crime wise, with all the shootings and everything," he said. "and it really -- rudy giuliani did a great job as mayor, and they really straightened things out with stop-and-frisk and it was used further by the next mayor, bloomberg, and now they just recently -- not so recently, but fairly recently -- they stopped it." under stop and frisk, police stop people on the street who they deem suspicious and think may be involved in criminal activity and search them on the spot for guns and illegal drugs, among other things. trump said the program worked and that it could impact gun violence in chicago. "now chicago is out of control. i was really referring to chicago stop and frisk. they asked me about chicago. and i was talking about stop and frisk for chicago," he said. trump had praised the practice -- which a federal judge ruled in new york in 2013 was unconstitutional, and unlawfully targeted blacks and latinos, although it was not banned outright -- in similar terms at the town hall wednesday night. "one of the things i'd do ... is i would do stop-and-frisk. i think you have to. we did it in new york, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically," trump said in response to an audience member's question. trump has previously touted stop-and-frisk policies, but his full-throated endorsement of it wednesday -- in which he called for its widespread implementation -- came as trump pressed forward with his pitch to african-american voters, appearing at a predominantly black church alongside several of his prominent black surrogates. new york mayor: donald trump wrong about 'stop-and-frisk' that pitch to african-americans hasn't come without a series of slip-ups, the latest of which came as trump invited the prominent boxing promoter don king, who is black, to introduce him at the church event -- only to have the celebrity use the n-word at the podium. and on tuesday, trump described the state of african-american communities as being in "absolutely the worst shape that they've ever been in before. ever. ever. ever." and comparing the us's inner cities to afghanistan. while trump has pledged to bring jobs and safety to the inner cities, he has offered few specifics as to how he would address those issues. but trump has called for beefing up the number of police officers in inner cities and argued that police officers need more latitude to do their jobs and backing from political figures -- a push not necessarily consistent with african-americans' frustrations over the spate of police shootings against unarmed black men, which have rocked the country. "you have to have, in my opinion -- i see what's going on here, i see what's going on in chicago -- i think stop-and-frisk. in new york city it was so incredible, the way it worked. now, we had a very good mayor, but new york city was incredible, the way that worked, so i think that could be one step you could do," trump said wednesday. the real estate mogul's call for introducing stop-and-frisk as a prescription for reducing "black-on-black crime" -- as the questioner put it in the town hall -- is also likely to face a stiff rebuke from minority leaders. many have opposed the practice during its use by new york city police as minorities were disproportionally targeted. in august 2013 a federal judge ruled that the nypd's stop-and-frisk policy violated the constitutional rights of minorities in new york. she didn't order an outright ban, but called for reform of the policy and outside oversight. the city under mayor michael bloomberg appealed that ruling, but those efforts were dropped under de blasio's administration, and the city is participating in an ongoing reform and oversight process, which is supervised by a federal monitor. "the united states constitution guarantees the rights of all americans, and the united states district court for the southern district of new york already ruled in 2013 that stop-and-frisk, as previously practiced in new york, was unconstitutional," said rep. elijah cummings, d-maryland. "these policies erode trust between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve. plus, they have proven to be ineffective." a november 2013 report from the new york attorney general revealed just 3% of stop-and-frisk stops led to convictions between 2009 and 2012. and in more than 5 million stops between 2002 and 2013, police recovered guns less than 0.02% of the time, according to police department data compiled by the new york civil liberties union in a 2014 report. stop-and-frisk was instituted by one of trump's most prominent supporters and advisers, former new york city mayor rudy giuliani. giuliani has continued to defend the practice in recent years, rebutting the statistics showing little correlation between stop-and-frisk and a reduction in crime. giuliani frequently joins trump on the campaign trail -- where he is introduced as "america's mayor" -- and argues that trump will bring the same tough-on-crime approach to the presidency. trump recently praised the stop-and-frisk policy in an interview earlier this month in philadelphia where he was asked about the african-american communities' concerns that stop-and-frisk amounts to racial profiling. "well, i think you are going to have it. so many people are being killed in philadelphia, that it's actually incredible when you look at the stats. i think you have to have it," he said in an interview with the local nbc station. trump pressed forward with his pitch to african-american voters wednesday afternoon during a rally in toledo, ohio -- where he again described black lives in the us in bleak terms. "to the african-american community, i say: vote for donald j. trump. i will fix it -- and i say, honestly, what do you have to lose? it's not gonna get any worse. it's terrible. the crime, the bad education, the no jobs. what do you have to lose? believe me, i will fix it. i'm gonna fix it," trump said. but new york city mayor bill de blasio said thursday that the belief that stop-and-frisk caused the city's crime rate to plummet is false. "i understand that people say that, (but) that's just not the history," he told cnn's alisyn camerota on "new day." the mayor said it was former new york city police department commissioner bill bratton promoting community policing in 1994 that led to the decrease of crime in the city. "that's what changed things in new york city," de blasio said. "the bottom line is it (stop-and-frisk) created a huge line of division between police and communities." "we ended that unconstitutional use of stop-and-frisk, that overuse of stop-and-frisk," he added. de blasio said that crime has actually decreased since the city all but ended stop-and-frisk three years ago. and that trump's facts on policing are inaccurate and would reverse the progress that the city has made, the mayor said. "donald trump talks about stop-and-frisk like he knows the facts," he said. "he has had no experience with policing, no experience with public safety." "he should really be careful because if we reinstituted stop-and-frisk all over this country, you'd see a lot more tension between police and communities," de blasio added. correction: an earlier version of this story misstated whether new york city is appealing the federal judge's 2013 ruling on stop-and-frisk. the city appealed the ruling at the time, but has since dropped that effort and is participating in an ongoing reform and oversight process. cnn's eugene scott contributed to this report.      trump touts stop-and-frisk practice amid black outreach      
__label__0 washington (cnn)boxing promoter don king thrust himself back into the political scene wednesday when he dropped the n-word at a donald trump minority outreach event. it's the latest step into the political fray for king, who has a long history of colorfully weighing in on politics on both sides of the aisle going back half a century. after serving nearly four years in prison for a manslaughter conviction in 1966 for killing an associate who owed him $600, king was later pardoned of the crime in 1983 by then-ohio gov. jim rhodes. the governor received letters of recommendation from several luminaries, including former presidential candidate jesse jackson, a democrat, and then-cleveland mayor (and future ohio senator) george voinovich, a republican. in 1992, king invoked his fifth amendment rights and refused to answer questions before a senate subcommittee investigating ties between boxing and organized crime. here are a few other political highlights from king's career: 'republicrat' at the june funeral for muhammad ali, with whom king at one point worked, he declared his non-partisan status. "i'm endorsing the people. i'm not a republican or a democrat, i'm a republicrat, and i go with the will of the people," he told the new york daily news. hillary clinton king previously praised trump's democratic presidential rival, hillary clinton, calling her "dynamic" at a 2014 fundraiser for senate minority leader harry reid, a major trump critic. "i have been a supporter of secretary clinton for a long time," king said at the event, which benefited the nevada senator's re-election campaign. "she is a dynamic woman, and i am a fighter for woman's rights," he added. barack obama the cleveland native supported president barack obama in both 2008 and 2012. at the time, he said white voters struggling to get behind a black candidate need to move past it. king said they should "ask god to help you pretend that barack obama is white," he told journalists. "i understand very well that after more than three centuries of being taught, conditioned and indoctrinated to hate the black man as your inferior, it is unrealistic to think that now you can just change to respect him," he wrote. "try to think of your beloved country america and what's best for miss liberty," king added. "then try not to think of barack obama as a black man but as an american fighting for what's best for your children and your country." reince priebus king, the new york times reported, was supposed to address this summer's republican national convention, but several republican national committee officials, including chairman reince priebus, nixed the idea, citing the promoter's legal problems. king later said the party chairman removed him because he doesn't "like black people." "i'm not speaking because reince priebus is still thinking he don't like black people," king told reporters in july. "i have less than a damn about what reince priebus thinks, especially when he's so antiquated." black lives matter king spoke on the tensions between black residents and law enforcement, saying the "root" of the problem gets lost in social media. "you can't use short-term slogans because people don't understand and they twist them around," he said on the floor of the republican national convention. "in our hashtag culture, we treat the effects, not the cause. you've got to get to the cause." female voters "you got to understand what i'm trying to say to you is that the white woman -- and i put it in this kind of (words) so you understand what i'm saying -- the white woman and the slave, the people of color," king said wednesday while campaigning for trump. "when the system was created, they did not get heard. the first will be last and the last will be first." "the white woman did not have the rights, and she still don't have the rights," he added. "and people of color don't have their rights -- those are the 'left outs.'" "donald trump says no -- we (are) going back to inclusiveness," king added.

__label__0 (cnn)hillary clinton and donald trump offered vastly different proposals wednesday to change police practices following fatal shootings of african-american men in oklahoma and north carolina. when asked how he would stop violence in the black community, trump said he would take the controversial stop-and-frisk practice nationwide. "i think you have to," the republican nominee said at a town hall with fox news host and trump supporter sean hannity. "we did it in new york, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically." civil liberties groups have blasted the practice as targeting minorities and some investigators have questioned its effectiveness. trump touts stop-and-frisk practice amid black outreach meanwhile, clinton campaign manager robby mook said the democratic nominee plans to develop national standards for police intended to "prevent situations like this." speaking on cnn's "new day," mook said clinton wants to "restore bonds between communities and law enforcement." that, he said, would involve "investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the relationships in the community to prevent something like this from happening." the candidates -- just days away from their first in-person clash on the debate stage -- were also far apart on the underlying causes of the shootings. clinton connected police shootings to "systemic racism" while trump suggested the officer in oklahoma "choked." comments carry weight this is not the first time trump or clinton have addressed police shootings during this lengthy campaign season. but as the race nears its conclusion in less than two months, their comments carry even more weight. and the stakes are especially high since one of the shootings occurred in north carolina, a critical swing state with a sizable african-american population that both campaigns are working hard to reach. trump and clinton hit the campaign trail following an evening of protests and occasional violence in charlotte after police killed keith lamont scott in an apartment complex parking lot as officers looked for another man named in a warrant they were trying to serve. that followed the fatal shooting of terence crutcher in tulsa, oklahoma, last week after his car was found abandoned in the middle of the road. trump 'very troubled' by oklahoma fatal police shooting clinton addressed the shootings in a speech in orlando, florida, on wednesday afternoon. "there is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. but we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of african-americans killed by police officers in these encounters," clinton said. "it's unbearable. and it needs to become intolerable." she said she's spoken with law enforcement leaders "who are as deeply concerned as i am, and as deeply committed as i am to reform." and, she said, she's spoken with mothers whose children have been killed, "and young people who feel that, as far as their country's concerned, their lives seem disposable." "we've got to do better. and i know we can. and if i'm elected president, we will. and we will do it exactly together, which is the only way it can be done," clinton said. trump tweeted calls for unity following the violence in charlotte. his comment during the fox town hall that the female officer involved in the tulsa shooting might have "choked" was notable considering he typically emphasizes support for law enforcement officers. but trump said he'd seen the widely circulated video of the incident in tulsa. "that man went to the car, hands up -- put his hands on the car," trump said. "to me it looked like he did everything you're supposed to do. and he looked like a really good man." christie vs. clinton meanwhile, one of trump's top supporters -- new jersey gov. chris christie -- lambasted clinton for her response on conservative talk radio host laura ingraham's show. in a radio interview tuesday, clinton had cited the need to address "systemic racism" and "implicit bias" in police forces -- while praising "honorable, cool-headed police officers." 2016: last call for working class whites? christie labeled those remarks a "disgrace" wednesday. "she's a disgrace. she's a disgrace and those comments are a disgrace," christie said wednesday on "the laura ingraham show." "it's typical of hillary clinton. she knows nothing but the mouth never stops." trump, however, has also displayed a tendency to speak about events before all the facts are made clear. he notably called the explosion in new york city over the weekend a "bomb" 30 minutes after the incident, despite a lack of official confirmation. african-american outreach the shootings come as trump and clinton confront unique challenges with african-american voters. clinton's weakness is among millennial voters across the board -- many of whom have told pollsters they are gravitating toward libertarian gary johnson and green party nominee jill stein. trump, meanwhile, is attempting to chip into clinton's commanding lead among african-american voters overall while also appealing to white voters who tend to support the gop but have been turned off by his rhetoric. that effort hit turbulence wednesday when trump campaigned alongside long-time boxing promoter don king wednesday in ohio. king, who is black, used the n-word while introducing trump, arguing that african-americans cannot achieve success while emulating whites because they will remain "negroes." "if you're poor, you are a poor negro -- i would use the n-word -- but if you're rich, you are a rich negro. if you are intelligent, intellectual, you are intellectual negro. if you are a dancing and sliding and gliding n***** -- i mean negro -- you are a dancing and sliding and gliding negro," king said, laughing along with the crowd after the slip-up. "you're going to be a negro 'til you die." the political history of don king trump also caused controversy tuesday night when he told a nearly all-white crowd in north carolina that "we're going to rebuild our inner cities because our african-american communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before. ever. ever. ever." his remark -- ignoring the nation's deeply flawed history of slavery, jim crow laws, segregation and more -- drew a stern rebuke wednesday from rep. john lewis, a georgia democrat and hero of the civil rights movement. "is he saying that the conditions are worse than slavery? is he saying that the conditions are worse than the signs that i that saw when i was growing up that said 'white men,' 'colored men,' 'white women,' 'colored women?'" lewis said. "where is he coming from?"       clinton, trump navigate politics of police violence

__label__0 washington (cnn)hillary clinton is leading donald trump by 6 points ahead of the first debate on monday, according to a new national poll released wednesday. a four-way matchup shows clinton has 43% support of likely voters while trump has 37%, in the new nbc/wall street journal poll. libertarian party nominee gary johnson is at 9% and the green party's jill stein is at 3%. in a two-way matchup, clinton leads trump by 7 points, 48% to 41%. clinton on police shootings: 'too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have' the poll was conducted after a rough patch for clinton, highlighted by her temporarily leaving the campaign trail after she was diagnosed with pneumonia. despite a recent effort to court african-american voters, trump garners just 7% support compared to clinton's 81% with the voting bloc. on the issues, trump has the advantage with voters when it comes to the economy -- 46% to 41%. but clinton leads when it comes to being in charge of nuclear weapons (51% to 25%), being a good commander in chief (48% to 33%) and on immigration (50% to 39%). trump and clinton are virtually tied when it comes to terrorism and homeland security (44% to 43%). a new cnn poll of polls, including the nbc/wsj data, finds clinton's edge over trump has inched up by 1 point. the poll of polls averages the results of the five most recent nationwide telephone polls of presidential preference among likely voters and finds her ahead, 43% to 40%. the nbc/wsj poll surveyed 992 likely voters between september 16-19 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.       national poll: clinton leads trump by 6 points      
__label__0 (cnn)former president george h.w. bush said monday that he will vote for hillary clinton in november, according to sources close to the 41st president -- an extraordinary rebuke of his own party's nominee. the sources said this was not the first time bush had disclosed his intention to vote for clinton. the comments came during a receiving line for board members of the bipartisan points of light foundation when bush was speaking to kathleen hartington kennedy townsend, robert f. kennedy's daughter and the former maryland lieutenant governor. there were roughly 40 people in the room, and it's not clear how many people heard him, though multiple sources did. the republican former president's embrace of the democratic nominee represents a dramatic new chapter in the complicated three-decade-old relationship between the two most prominent families in american politics. it's a stunning political move -- one that comes just 49 days from the election, and less than a week before clinton and donald trump square off in their first debate. trump's campaign manager, kellyanne conway, told cnn's erin burnett tuesday that she respects "the 92-year-old former president very much and his decision." "it is ironic that he would vote for the wife of the man who knocked him out of the race," she added on "erin burnett outfront." "but look, this was a bruising primary ... so i know there are a lot of hurt feelings there." news of his support for clinton came first on facebook, when kennedy townsend posted a photo of herself with george h.w. bush, along with the caption: "the president told me he's voting for hillary!!" kennedy townsend sits on the advisory board of the points of light foundation. bush family representatives declined to respond publicly. "the vote president bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days. he is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim," bush spokesman jim mcgrath said in a statement. but sources with knowledge of the conversation told cnn they were surprised and disappointed that kennedy townsend had publicly shared a private conversation with the former president. kennedy townsend declined to comment through a spokesman at the rock creek group, where she works as managing director. she later took down the facebook post. gop's trump divide trump's controversial candidacy has split the group of former republican nominees. mitt romney has hammered trump in speeches and on twitter, calling him unfit for office. but former kansas sen. bob dole has endorsed trump, as has arizona sen. john mccain -- though somewhat reluctantly, often referring to "the republican nominee" rather than trump by name. neither george h.w. bush nor george w. bush had weighed in on the general election -- even as trump savaged george w. bush's decision to go to war in iraq. however, many of the 41st and 43rd presidents' cabinet secretaries and national security officials have backed clinton. george h.w. bush national security adviser brent scowcroft endorsed clinton in june, saying she "has the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time." george w. bush commerce secretary carlos gutierrez said on cnn in august that he "would have preferred jeb bush, but i think hillary is a great choice. i am afraid of what donald trump would do to this country." and louis wade sullivan, the health and human services secretary under george h.w. bush and the only african-american in his cabinet, said this month that "though my enthusiasm for hillary clinton is somewhat tempered, i certainly believe she is an infinitely better choice for president than donald trump." but george h.w. bush isn't speaking for his entire family. marvin bush, the former president's youngest son, has said he would vote for libertarian gary johnson. george p. bush, george h.w. bush's grandson, has backed trump. and jeb bush, trump's former primary rival, has said he won't vote for trump or clinton. a representative for george w. bush wouldn't comment on kennedy townsend's facebook post or how george h.w. bush would vote. the representative simply said george w. bush is "spending his time working to keep the senate in republican hands and is not commenting on the presidential campaign." the bush-clinton relationship the evolving relationship between the bush and clinton families began in 1992, when bill clinton ran against -- and defeated -- incumbent president george h.w. bush. eight years later, with clinton term-limited out of office, bush's son, then-texas gov. george w. bush, succeeded clinton on a pledge to "restore honor and dignity" to the white house -- a not-so-subtle knock on clinton's marital infidelity. but bill clinton and george h.w. bush have also spent their post-presidencies teaming up for philanthropic endeavors. and in recent years, bill clinton and george w. bush have increasingly appeared together. the two grew so close that george w. bush has referred to clinton as his "brother from another mother," and clinton has said the two bonded over becoming grandfathers. a bush-clinton matchup early in the 2016 campaign cycle, it appeared the two families could be headed for another showdown with the presidency on the line: hillary clinton was seeking the democratic nomination, while former florida gov. jeb bush -- the 41st president's son and the 43rd president's brother -- was a republican candidate and a fundraising powerhouse. even if george h.w. bush hadn't endorsed hillary clinton, it was hard to envision him backing trump. neither of the former bush presidents attended the republican national convention in cleveland, where trump became the gop's nominee -- with the bush family staying out of presidential politics after jeb bush, denounced repeatedly by trump as "low-energy," exited the race. clarification: this story has been updated to clarify the context in which george h.w. bush made his comment about voting for hillary clinton. cnn's daniella diaz contributed to this report.      sources: bush 41 says he will vote for clinton      
__label__0 washington (cnn)the number of individuals who were supposed to have been deported but were instead granted citizenship is far higher than was initially reported by media covering the department of homeland security inspector general's office report on the matter. on monday, the inspector general reported that 858 individuals from "special interest countries" -- meaning countries that are considered to be "of concern to the national security" of the us -- were supposed to have been deported but were instead granted us citizenship. but the truth is the report is even worse than reported, with more than 1,800 individuals naturalized who should have been deported from the country. a reason for the underplaying of the number may have been the report's focus, which was whether the us citizenship and immigration services was using digital fingerprints effectively. the inspector general determined that the agency granted citizenship to 858 individuals who had been ordered deported or removed under another identity but "their digital fingerprint records were not available" during the naturalization process. but a footnote on page one of the report also states that there were, as of november 2015, an additional 953 individuals about whom the inspector general couldn't determine if there was a problem with the fingerprint records specifically, but also should have been deported. this other group consisted of members of a slightly broader classification, from countries of concern as well as from neighboring countries where there is a history of fraud. that amounts to a total of 1,811 individuals granted citizenship who should not have been. the department of homeland security responded to the report, saying it would review all 1,811 individuals "out of an abundance of caution." monday's report drew condemnation from many republicans in congress, including sen. ben sasse, r-nebraska, who said "a bureaucracy that blunders so badly is one that doesn't take our national security seriously." the white house said tuesday it's "clear" some systems need improving following a glitch with dhs' fingerprint system that led to hundreds of people inadvertently being granted citizenship. "it's clear there needs to be an improvement in terms of digitizing some of the fingerprint records," said white house spokesman josh earnest. "additional progress would have been made if additional resources had been appropriated by congress." he said the obama administration "certainly takes seriously the consideration that is made in terms of protecting our national security in terms of our immigration system." cnn's kevin liptak contributed to this report.      the lead with jake tapper - weekdays 4 p.m. et number of those wrongly given citizenship higher than initially reported      
__label__0 greensboro, north carolina (cnn)donald trump declined tuesday to answer reporters' questions about his sudden shift on the issue of president barack obama's birthplace. trump ignored reporters' questions during a stop at a restaurant here, the first opportunity journalists covering his campaign have had to ask the republican nominee about his reversal on the issue. in a brief statement on friday, trump asserted that he now believed obama was born in the us and then refused to answer reporters' questions after the press event, which campaign aides told media members would be a press conference. for years, trump was one of the most prominent and vocal pushers of the "birther" conspiracy theory that falsely claimed obama was not born in the us. obama produced his long-form birth certificate in 2011 that proved he was born in hawaii. while trump surrogates like new jersey gov. chris christie have falsely asserted in recent days that trump dropped his birtherism in recent years, trump declined numerous opportunities to disavow his previous support of the conspiracy theory. in the two weeks before his sudden statement on friday, trump was asked four times about his birther beliefs -- and trump declined each opportunity to disavow the falsehood or his role in pushing that conspiracy theory. trump spent tuesday campaigning in the battleground state of north carolina, where the latest polls show him in a dead heat with hillary clinton.       trump doesn't answer questions on 'birther' shift      
__label__0 united nations (cnn)president barack obama made an impassioned plea tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis "of epic proportions," despite a political backlash in the us against absorbing those fleeing middle east violence. the president's interest in calling attention to the tens of millions of displaced people around the world, and pushing back against the anti-refugee tenor, was underscored by his decision to convene a leaders' summit on refugees at the united nations tuesday. at the summit, he also rejected another aspect of the american political debate swirling around accepting foreigners -- gop presidential nominee donald trump's call to build a wall along the us-mexico border. "this crisis is a test of our common humanity. whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls, or whether we see ourselves in another," obama said, though he didn't mention trump by name. obama singled out the situation in syria, which has displaced 4.8 million people so far, as particularly "unacceptable." "we are not as unified as we should be in pushing to make it stop," he said, describing the global refugee crisis as both a humanitarian and security challenge that tests countries' ability to take collective action. "i called this summit because this crisis is one of the most urgent tests of our time," he said. "just as failure to act in the past -- for example, by turning away jews fleeing nazi germany -- is a stain on our collective conscience, i believe history will judge us harshly if we do not rise to this moment." the refugee issue is one that's captured the world's attention more in the past two years than at perhaps any time since world war ii, seared into the public's consciousness by photos like that of a 3-year-old syrian boy who drowned in the mediterranean and the flood of migrants into europe. a recent study by from the un's refugee agency estimated 65.3 million people were displaced from their homes by conflict or persecution in 2015, up by over five million from the prior year. many are internally displaced within the borders of their own countries, but about 21.3 million are classified as refugees. obama's summit follows a similar un-led meeting on the issue monday, which drew attention to the crisis but offered little in the way of binding commitments. related: donald trump jr. likens syrian refugees to skittles candy "make no mistake," us secretary of state john kerry said at the un meeting, "additional efforts are urgently needed." leaders also called for a more orderly and equitable system to manage refugee flows -- acknowledging the burden is shouldered disproportionally by certain regions. "you have to know that today the european union has a clear objective to restore order on its external borders," european council president donald tusk said in his remarks, signaling a growing sense that patience in europe with the migrant flow is wearing thin. "there will be no repeat of the year 2015 with more than one and a half million irregular migrants," he added. the obama administration is hopeful the leader's summit on tuesday afternoon can build momentum for more action. national security advisor susan rice in june announced that the gathering -- co-hosted along with the us by canada, ethiopia, germany, jordan, mexico, sweden and the un secretary general -- would seek an increase in funding of at least 30%, a doubling of permanent resettlement, and expanded access to education and work rights for refugees. "reaching these ambitious objectives will be challenging, yet the level of need demands no less," rice said in a statement. but aid groups are skeptical the summit will prompt the kind of action they say is desperately needed. "we have to be optimistic that we'll see some real concrete commitments," said amnesty international's interim executive director margaret huang. "but the truth is, even if those numbers are hit, it's nowhere near what's actually needed." the us is a major contributor of humanitarian aid for countries that host large numbers of refugees -- particularly syria's neighbors -- and plans to increase the number of refugees it will take in to america from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 next year. the president's chief spokesman last week conceded that even as the administration calls for greater global action, it is limited in what it can do. "the president's commitment to ensuring that the united states plays a leading role on this issue is not shared by a lot of people in congress, including by a lot of people in the republican majority in congress," press secretary josh earnest told reporters. "and that has an impact in terms of the resources that are dedicated to this effort." vetting efforts to screen refugees, he noted, "are not cheap." related: boat survivor: i am a refugee with a voice david miliband, president of the international rescue committee and a former british foreign secretary, said he's hopeful but waiting to see whether any agreements are backed up with action. "the scale of the global refugee problem demands an appropriate scale of response," miliband told cnn. "governments around the world haven't, in the main, been responding with the right degree of compassion or competence up to now." but the co-hosts of the leaders' summit said in a statement they were pleased with "new and significant humanitarian contributions" from world leaders. "we sought a $3 billion increase in global humanitarian financing and commitments to maintain funding in future years," they said. "through our mutual efforts, over the course of 2016, the 32 donors participating today have contributed this year roughly 4.5 billion additional dollars to un appeals and international humanitarian organizations than in 2015." as they await action from world leaders in new york, a group of volunteers in london laid out a "life jacket graveyard" monday to draw attention to the plight of thousands of migrants who've lost their lives attempting hazardous boat crossings in the mediterranean. the conflict in syria and resulting migrant crisis in the middle east and europe have dominated headlines over the past 18 months, but refugees are a global problem. perhaps nowhere are they more prevalent than in the so-called "global south" -- the developing countries of the southern hemisphere. last week, south sudan joined the ranks of syria, afghanistan, and somalia -- countries with over 1 million of their citizens living as refugees abroad. and protracted conflict in places like somalia have led to a generation of lifelong refugees -- men and women in their twenties who've never known life outside of a camp. "these are not people who can envision what life would be like if they were returned to their home countries," huang said.       obama: refugee crisis is test of our humanity      
__label__0 washington (cnn)during an interview with fox news channel's bill o'reilly monday night, donald trump spoke about how american screeners need to profile people in order to spot potential terrorists. here's a portion of that conversation: o'reilly: now, another thing you said that was very controversial is that you want to profile. you want to profile arab or muslim men. how would that work? trump: well, we have no choice. look, israel does it. and israel does it very successfully. o'reilly: they do it at the airports. they do it at the airports. trump: well, they do it. they do it. and when they see somebody that they would like to talk to, that they would like to look at, that they would maybe like to open up their satchel and take a look inside, they do it. and they don't like to do it. i don't like to do it. but we have to be -- you know, you have a woman who is 87-year-old in a wheelchair from sweden and we have to look at her. we have to look at somebody else. it's ridiculous what's going on there. o'reilly: so, what would you do though? trump: if you want to be so politically correct -- o'reilly: do you have a vision of how that profiling would work? trump: it works. and we see somebody that we think there could be a problem. at airports and other places. you talked to them and you see what's going on. o'reilly: but i think they do that now. trump: we don't do that. as trump would say, excuse me, excuse me -- but we do. screening at airports does not just entail putting everyone through a metal detector. the transportation security administration has had protocols for years that tell agents what kinds of behaviors to check. but tsa insists it is behavioral, not racial, profiling. last year, tsa began a pilot program to update these protocols. the agencies does not publicly lists the kinds of activities that can draw an agent's attention. but in march 2015, the intercept website published what it said was a confidential memo that told tsa screeners at that time what to look for. among the suspicious signs: - exaggerated yawning. - excessive complaints about the screening process. - widely open staring eyes. - wearing improper attire for location. - whistling as the individual approaches the screening process. - gazing down. - exaggerated or repetitive grooming gestures. - face pale from recent shaving of beard. - rubbing or wringing of hands. - excessive throat clearing so if tsa is already profiling people based on behavior, what further profiling would trump like them to do?       reality check: trump wrong on profiling      
__label__0 (cnn)for as far as chris christie has fallen politically over the last three years, there has always been one saving grace: no evidence existed to directly tie him to the incident that sank his presidential ambitions. until, at least according to us prosecutors, now. it was an unexpected moment during the monday opening statement by vikhas khanna, an assistant us attorney prosecuting two former christie administration officials now charged with fraud -- the assertion that christie was aware of the alleged political retribution being carried out by aides. it was one that directly contradicted years of christie's statements to the contrary, including one as recently as sunday. "i have been investigated by three different entities, two of them led by partisan democrats, who have all found that i had no knowledge of this incident and no involvement in it," the new jersey governor told jake tapper on cnn's "state of the union." christie has never been charged and never listed as a co-conspirator by prosecutors. but the revelation put forth by prosecutors underscored once again, for all to see, the scope of the political scandal that played the leading role in destroying his presidential ambitions. and his vice presidential ambitions. and, quite possibly, any cabinet ambitions in a donald trump administration. in september 2013, christie allies shut down lanes of the george washington bridge in an alleged effort to exact political retribution on the democratic mayor of the town of fort lee, who had refused to endorse christie's re-election. christie's former deputy chief of staff, bridget anne kelly, and former port authority deputy executive director bill baroni have pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges in connection to the lane closures christie's blanket rejection of any involvement -- and any knowledge -- of what occurred in september 2013 has been consistent and unyielding. through investigations, both internal and by new jersey democrats, and a battering from local officials and the press, the new jersey governor remained steadfast. "how many more investigations do you want?" a frustrated christie would ask reporters at one point. yet, as if to underscore how comfortable he was in his innocence, christie still decided to launch his presidential bid. it was an effort that sought to recapture the moment -- and momentum -- christie was party to shortly after his blowout re-election victory in november 2013. but christie was clearly wounded. he went from leading the party's initial polls to firmly stuck in the middle tier of the pack. and that was before donald trump proceeded to run roughshod over the field. for a period, christie appeared to be getting back on track. his favorability numbers, which tanked in the wake of the bridge scandal, started to turn right-side up in the crucial state of new hampshire at the end of 2015, aided by a major advertising blitz by the super pac supporting his candidacy. but it was short-lived. even as the issue rarely came up during the dozens of town hall he held, christie couldn't recapture his campaign magic. "i have both won elections that i was supposed to lose and i have lost elections that i was supposed to win," christie told supporters after his sixth place finish in new hampshire. "and what that means is you never know, and it's both the magic and mystery of politics that you never quite know when which is going to happen even when you think you do." but christie and his aides, in candid moments, couldn't help but talk about what may have happened were it not for the george washington bridge -- an exercise repeated in july, as trump went through the process of selecting his running mate. christie himself, in an interview on msnbc, acknowledged that the "bridgegate" scandal contributed to trump's decision not to select him as his running mate. "i'm sure it was a factor," christie said. it was a position, aides said, that by the end of the selection process christie was openly lobbying for -- and one he acknowledged afterward he was disappointed not to receive. "i'm a competitive person," christie said in a cnn interview in july. "when it was clear that donald wanted me to compete for this job and to be considered, i wanted to win, of course you do." for now, trump advisers say, christie is firmly encamped inside trump's inner circle. a confidante and sounding board, christie has a three-pronged role in trump's operation: surrogate, adviser and the head of trump's presidential transition team. trump, in a statement to the new york times, made no mention of the court case or christie's potential plight -- instead making clear he had no plans of abandoning the man who provided his first top-tier endorsement in the primary, saying christie has "been a spectacular advocate ever since." he's also gained repeated plaudits for his transition efforts -- a secretive operation that nonetheless has been lauded by lobbyists, donors and gop officials who have received briefings on its work. "it's the most in-shape thing the trump guys have going right now," one lobbyist who attended one of the briefings told cnn. but many of those looped in on the transition operations have long thought one of the recipients of a top job in a trump administration would be ... christie. asked on msnbc if he wanted a role in a trump administration last week, christie responded simply: "it depends on what i'm offered." but the question now becomes what can christie, long considered in the running to be attorney general, can be offered. as one gop official supporting trump pointed out: "trump respects his loyalty -- and that's why he's fine now. but i have a sneaking suspicion senate democrats, who he'd need to get confirmed don't care much about that."       for christie, 'bridgegate' once again rears its ambition-killing head      
__label__0 kenansville, north carolina (cnn)donald trump bragged tuesday there's "nothing like" using other people's money, hours after a report said he used more than $250,000 from his charitable organization to litigate lawsuits against his business interests. trump, while calling for building safe zones in syria financed by gulf states, vaunted the benefits of doing business with "opm." "it's called opm. i do it all the time in business. it's called other people's money," trump said. "there's nothing like doing things with other people's money because it takes the risk -- you get a good chunk out of it and it takes the risk." his comments came on the heels of a washington post report published earlier tuesday, which called attention to trump's funneling of contributions from the donald j. trump foundation to charities in order to settle lawsuits against trump. trump has only sparsely contributed to his foundation. instead, the foundation is largely funded by outside donors -- not trump himself. trump did not make those comments in the context of that report on tuesday. the republican presidential nominee has frequently lauded the benefits of "opm," telling his supporters at rallies that he would put the tactic to use for the country's benefit. trump has frequently called for other countries to chip in larger amounts to help pay for the us military to maintain its bases around the world, in addition to calling for gulf states like saudi arabia to bear a larger financial burden in the fight against isis and in building a safe zone to shelter refugees. trump has called for building a safe zone at the same time as he has stiffly argued against allowing any more syrian refugees into the us. even though refugees undergo numerous screenings and a lengthy vetting process that can take more than a year, trump has argued they could represent a national security threat to the united states.       trump brags about using 'other people's money' amid questions over charity use      
__label__0 (cnn)us forces will be ready within weeks to help iraqi forces in their battle to retake mosul from isis, according to gen. joseph dunford, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. "our job is to actually help the iraqis generate the forces and the support necessary for operations in mosul and we'll be ready for that in october," dunford told a small group of reporters traveling with him. "the noose is gradually tightening around mosul," he added. the city, iraq's second-largest, is isis' last significant stronghold in the country. it and syria's raqqa -- the group's self-declared capital -- are the major targets left for the us-led coalition to take back from its control. dunford's statement is the clearest sign from a senior us military official that the military battle for mosul could soon begin once the iraqis make the political decision to proceed. it also means the battle for mosul may be raging during the us presidential election, with us forces facing dangers on the battlefield. those troops might also be called upon to help begin providing humanitarian aid. dunford, along with defense secretary ash carter, is scheduled to testify before the senate armed services committee thursday. both are expected to face stiff questioning from republicans on the panel about the obama administration's strategy to fight isis. cnn has learned the pentagon is now considering setting up new remote bases well outside mosul as hubs from which us forces can operate. those types of bases, given their locations, are likely to be less secure than the large bases the us has generally been using. they could be used by us military advisers who are expected to work with the iraqis in the field. because of the remote locations, security may be difficult. us forces may move "in and out" of the bases rather than locate there consistently, one official said. these bases are in addition to the large iraqi base south of mosul at qayyarah, where hundreds of us troops are already located to assist with supplies, logistics and support for the iraqi forces. a key decision to be made is whether additional us conventional and special operations forces will be needed for ensuring the iraqis succeed, several us defense official told cnn. the us forces will not be on the front lines but will be out in the field with iraqi units, officials said. some forces already in iraq could be reassigned to northern iraq, or additional forces could be sent. president barack obama and iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi's meeting in new york monday also signaled the mosul operation may soon unfold. "we feel confident that we will be in a position to move forward fairly rapidly," obama said. calling mosul a "challenging battle," obama also noted that the us will be "prepared to help provide rapid humanitarian assistance" to displaced iraqis. abadi underscored the urgency. "we hope within the next few months we're going to kick daesh out of mosul and we'll deliver a huge blow to what daesh believes in," said abadi, using another name for the terrorist group.       us forces nearly ready to help iraq push to retake mosul      
__label__0 (cnn)the arrest of ahmad khan rahami, the man suspected of saturday's bombing in new york and explosion in new jersey, is reviving a debate that's become familiar when american citizens are implicated in terrorism post-9/11: whether or not they can be considered enemy combatants. sen. lindsey graham, r-south carolina, and others have suggested that rahami be detained by the military as an enemy combatant, in part so he would not have be read his miranda rights. here are five common questions about terrorism suspects and the legal system: 1) do u.s.-citizen terrorism suspects arrested within the united states have constitutional protections in the first place? yes. there are ongoing debates over the constitutional rights of non-citizens (and citizens traveling overseas), but the supreme court has never suggested that a us citizen arrested within the united states receives lesser constitutional protection simply because he's a terrorism suspect. to the contrary, as justice felix frankfurter once wrote: "the safeguards of liberty have frequently been forged in controversies involving not very nice people." put more bluntly, providing us-citizen terrorism suspects with full constitutional protection is how we can be sure, as a society, that they're punished according to principles of justice, rather than vengeance. 2) can such individuals be detained by the military? probably not. a federal statute enacted in 1971 (in response to the world war ii-era japanese american internment camps) prohibits the detention of us citizens "except pursuant to an act of congress," and no statute expressly authorizes the detention without trial of us-citizen terrorism suspects. the supreme court has held that the authorization for use of military force (aumf), enacted by congress one week after 9/11, implicitly authorizes the detention of us citizens captured in afghanistan while fighting on behalf of al qaeda or the taliban. but four justices have suggested that the aumf does not authorize the detention of even those individuals when captured within the united states -- and without such an affiliation, there's no argument that the aumf applies. 3) can us-citizen terrorism suspects be prosecuted in the guantánamo military commissions? no. when congress enacted the military commissions act of 2006, it expressly limited the statute to "alien" defendants. and although there are precedents from world war ii for trying us citizens in military commissions, that's only when the citizen is accused of international war crimes (which terrorism, by itself, is not). 4) can us-citizen terrorism suspects be interrogated? absolutely. no rule, statute, or constitutional provision prevents the government from interrogating terrorism suspects -- so long as none of the interrogation methods involve torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment (prohibitions that today apply equally whether the interrogation is conducted by the fbi, the military, and the cia). there are many examples of lawful interrogations in terrorism cases producing actionable intelligence information. 5) at what point do us-citizen terrorism suspects have to be apprised of their miranda rights? not right away. first, miranda is only an exclusionary rule -- meaning that the penalty for interrogating a suspect without reading him his rights is simply the exclusion of his statements from his trial. second, even if admissibility at trial were an issue, the supreme court has recognized a "public safety" exception to miranda, where the interrogation is designed to identify future threats to the public, and not to elicit further evidence of the suspect's guilt. thus, in the case of the so-called "underwear bomber," the government conducted a substantial interrogation of the suspect before reading him his rights, but was still allowed to use his statements during that period against him at trial. finally, there's no direct correlation between the provision of miranda rights and a suspect's refusal to cooperate. so in a case like this one, there's little reason to think that miranda really does prevent the government from taking necessary steps to prevent future acts of terrorism. vladeck is a cnn contributor and professor of law at the university of texas school of law.      what the us government can and cannot do to us citizens suspected of terrorism      
__label__0 washington (cnn)the biggest story of the 2016 election is undoubtedly the rise of donald trump, and behind the republican nominee is a group in its last throes as the biggest force in politics: the white working class. a new survey from cnn and the kaiser family foundation delves deeply into this pivotal group, to understand their experience in an america whose changing demographics and economy have arguably impacted this group more than almost any other. contrary to many assumptions about this group, the poll finds working class whites generally happy with their lives, and mostly satisfied with their personal financial situation. just 18% say they are angry about the way things are going in their own lives, and 44% think america's best days lie ahead. they are just as likely as their black and hispanic working class counterparts to feel optimistic about their lives, 7 in 10 or more say so in each group. but the white working class harbors deep concerns about the country's economy, the amount the government is doing to help the working class and their own ability to influence politics. a majority, 53%, say they are very dissatisfied with the country's economic situation and 84% say their views are not well represented by the government in washington, well above the share of white college graduates or black or hispanic working class to say the same. about 6 in 10 white working class people say it's gotten harder for people like them to get ahead financially and two-thirds say it's harder to find good jobs. many are concerned about what the next generation will face: 50% say they expect their children to have a lower standard of living than they currently have, compared with 35% among whites who have college degrees, 43% among the black working class and 31% among the hispanic working class. more than other groups, whites without college degrees blame the government for the economic problems that beset the working class, with 62% saying the federal government deserves all or most of the blame for those problems compared with less than half among whites with degrees and the black and hispanic working class, and 66% saying it doesn't do enough to help the working class. amid these concerns, trump holds broad appeal among white working class voters. sixty percent say they would consider trump this fall, about double the 29% who say they'd consider hillary clinton. among other groups, far fewer even say they would consider trump. among whites with college degrees, 39% say they'd consider him -- that's cut in half among hispanic working class voters, 18% of whom say they'd consider trump, and just 3% of black working class voters say they'll give trump a look. white working class voters are more republican than democratic, 56% in the cnn/kff poll are republicans or independents who lean that way, compared with 33% who consider themselves democrats or are independents who lean that way, but the poll reveals that their views on what the government does to help people like them and the changing demographics of the country -- two issues that have been a central focus of trump's campaign -- are driven by both education and partisanship. the undeniable trend for nearly all of american history, whites without college degrees -- the group identified as white working class for the purposes of this survey and in many assessments of the american electorate -- made up a majority of the public and a majority of voters. that has changed, and rapidly, at the same time the nation's economy has shifted to favor those who hold college degrees. ronald reagan was elected in 1980 by an electorate in which 63% of voters were whites who had not completed a four-year college education, according to exit polls. that had dropped 10 points by 1992, when bill clinton won the presidency. that election marked the last time exit polls would find whites without college degrees to be a majority of voters. by the time barack obama won the presidency in 2008, just 39% of those who cast ballots were whites without degrees. census figures for voting and registration suggest that the white working class make up a larger share of the electorate than do the exit polls, roughly 44% in 2012 in that estimate. both data sources have different and unquantifiable sources of error, and there has been some dispute over their true share of the electorate. regardless of the data source, however, the trend is the same and undeniable -- the white working class is shrinking, and at the same time, their ability to influence american politics has declined. enter trump. working class white voters have been critical to trump's success. throughout the republican primaries, trump's victories were bolstered by support from whites without degrees. across 28 states with exit or entrance polls this spring, trump averaged 50% support among white non-college gop primary voters or caucus participants, compared with 37% among whites with college degrees. and across five cnn/orc polls conducted since the primaries ended in june, trump's lead among white non-college voters averages 29 points, while white college voters have broken in clinton's direction by an average of 8 points. restated in terms similar to the oft-cited gender gap, that adds up to a 37-point education gap among whites. according to exit polls back to 1980, it has never been larger than 14 points. the white working class shifts republican democrats used to be the party of the white working class, and republicans, the party of the college educated. those roles have flipped. ron brownstein, a cnn senior political analyst and editorial director for strategic partnerships at atlantic media who has reported extensively on this group, calls it class inversion. "in the 50s, 60s, and 70s, democrats ran better among non-college than college whites," he said. "starting in the 80s, the two lines converged, and in 2000, (al) gore ran better among college than non-college whites, (john) kerry ran 6 points better, obama 7 points." some of that is due to the shifting economy. working class whites were largely synonymous with union members, who are traditionally staunchly democratic. as the service economy has grown and manufacturing declined, the profile of union members has changed. in 1980, 70% of all voters who came from union households were whites without college degrees; in 2012, the white working class made up just were 39% of voters from union households. non-whites and white college graduates were each about 30% of the union vote in 2012, almost double their share of the 1980 vote, and those two groups are increasingly democratic. but some of it is their differing views on government and change in american society. within the white working class, those who consider themselves democrats and those who say they are republican tend to agree in their assessment of how the working class is doing. about 7 in 10 working class white voters in each party say it's gotten harder for people like them to find good jobs, and narrow majorities of both say the government isn't doing enough to help "people like you." and while they don't see exactly eye-to-eye on immigration or the increasing diversity of the united states, both sets of partisans are more apt than their college-educated counterparts to see a negative side to the country's shifting demographics. both working class white democrats and republicans are more likely than white college educated partisans to feel that the country's increasing racial and ethnic diversity is harmful because it leaves some people feeling left behind. the same pattern emerges in perceptions of immigrants, with white non-college partisans more apt than white partisans with degrees to say immigrants today are a burden on the united states and that the government should attempt to deport all immigrants currently living in the us illegally. and in a party whose second-place finisher for this year's presidential nomination considers himself a socialist, working-class white democrats are less apt than their college-educated counterparts to consider themselves liberal or to be non-religious, two factors that could be driving them away from the obama-era democratic party. among white working class democrats who are registered to vote, 22% say they would consider voting for trump, vs. just 2% among white democrats with college degrees, and nearly a quarter, 23%, say they will definitely not vote for clinton, a figure that stands at 3% among white democrats with college degrees. the effects of this shift are showing in recent swing-state polling. trump's best chance to win the presidency comes by flipping rust-belt states where democrats have had natural advantages in recent presidential elections and which have larger than average blocs of white non-college voters -- pennsylvania, michigan and wisconsin among them. in each, trump has cut into clinton's advantage with broad support from the white working class. in the pure battlegrounds, ohio and iowa also appear to be shifting trump's way on the strength of his support among white non-college voters. "democrats have run slightly better among blue-collar whites in midwestern swing states, and that has been a key to them holding those states," said brownstein. will they vote? majorities of voters across partisan, education, and racial lines say they are dissatisfied with the influence that people like them have on the political process. but there are broader differences when asked about the likelihood of actually turning out to impact that process. in the cnn/kff poll, 71% of white non-college voters said they always vote in presidential elections, and 79% rated the chances that they would vote a 10 out of 10. but both figures were smaller than among whites who do have college degrees, about 9 in 10 in that group said they always vote and would be very likely to this time around. but a cnn/orc poll in early september found almost no difference between whites with degrees and those without in terms of enthusiasm about voting this year. forty-two percent of white college graduates were extremely or very enthusiastic, as were 43% of white non-college registered voters. should turnout levels among whites without degrees, whites with degrees and non-whites continue along their current trajectory, the white working class would likely emerge from 2016 still the largest voting bloc in the country in terms of race and educational attainment, for what may be the last time. the cnn/kff poll was conducted by telephone august 9 through september 5 among a nationally representative sample of 1,614 adults, including 701 people who were identified as working class whites -- white non-hispanic adults who do not currently hold a four-year degree and, if under age 25, not currently enrolled in school. results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, it is 5 points for results among members of the white working class, 6 points for whites with degrees, 10 points for black working class respondents and 9 points for the hispanic working class. full methodological details are available here.       2016: last call for working class whites?      
__label__0 washington (cnn)the state department welcomed sudan's efforts to counter isis and other terrorist groups tuesday despite the fact that sudan has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism for more than 20 years. "the united states welcomes sudan's recent efforts to increase counterterrorism cooperation with the united states," state department spokesman john kirby said in a statement. "sudan has taken important steps to counter isil and other terrorist groups and has sought to prevent their movement into and through sudan. sudan's continued cooperation will bolster international efforts to combat terrorism in the broader region," kirby added, using the government's preferred acronym for isis. kirby went on to say that the governments of the us and sudan would cooperate "on counterterrorism to enhance the security of both our countries," adding that such cooperation would be "subject to and consistent with‎ us law." the state department labeled sudan a state sponsor of terrorism since 1993. "sudan was designated as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1993 due to concerns about support to international terrorist groups to include the abu nidal organization, palestine islamic jihad, hamas, and hezbollah," according to the department's 2015 report on terrorism, though the report notes that sudan's support to those groups "appeared to have declined" in 2015. the country also was home to osama bin laden and his followers from 1991 until 1996, with the department's terrorism report saying bin laden was "provided safe haven in sudan for five years until he was expelled by the sudanese government in 1996." while there, bin laden is believed to have helped orchestrate several terror attacks. he was eventually expelled by the sudanese government for his involvement with al qaeda and subsequently relocated to afghanistan. sudan is one of only three countries to be designated a state sponsor of terrorism, with the other two being syria and iran. when asked about the apparent contradiction, kirby issued a statement to cnn, saying, "we engage bilaterally in a number of areas and cooperation in these areas will help us normalize ties." but, he added, "complete normalization of relations would require significant progress in a range of other areas, including an end to the fighting in darfur and the two areas." the latter designation refers to the south kordofan and blue nile states of sudan which, along with darfur, have been the site of violent armed conflict between the government in khartoum and opposition groups over the past several years. the international criminal court issued warrants for the arrest of sudan's long-serving president omar al bashir in 2009 and 2010 for "crimes against humanity" and "war crimes" pertaining to his actions during the conflict in darfur. "as we've consistently said, we would initiate the process of rescinding sudan's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism only if the government of sudan met all the criteria," kirby said. according to kirby, these steps included the "certification that the government of sudan has not provided support to international terrorism in the preceding six-month period and that the government has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future," noting that the "process has not been initiated." "we have been quite clear with the sudanese on the steps that need to be taken," he added. cnn's laura koran contributed to this story      us lauds state sponsor of terrorism ... for fighting terrorism      
__label__0 white, working-class and worried is a cnn partnership with the kaiser family foundation - an extensive survey of white, working-class americans and voters, who form a backbone of the support for donald trump. watch anderson cooper 360 and cnn.com for reports throughout the week. washington (cnn)the white, working-class americans who form a backbone of donald trump's political support have a split view of muslim immigrants -- strong majorities believe both that immigrants from muslim countries increase the threat of terrorism in the united states, but also that most immigrants from those countries are good people. the data is from a new survey from cnn and the kaiser family foundation and is aimed at unveiling the political motivations of the voting bloc that has propelled the gop nominee. threats of terror, both abroad and at home, have repeatedly rolled the race for the white house and the candidates have sought to improve their standing with voters in their responses to the terror attacks in paris, brussels, san bernardino, calif., and most recently after the attacks in new york and new jersey. polls generally show that voters trust trump more than hillary clinton to handle terrorism.  trump's tough talk about combating terrorism and threats abroad, including a plan to erect a wall at the us-mexico border and his repeated suggestion that profiling as a preventative tactic against terrorism has helped fueled his rise. while a majority (63%) of white, working-class americans say immigrants from muslim countries are generally good people, the same share say that immigrants from muslim countries increase the risk of terrorist attacks. members of this group, which exit polls had at around 44% of the us electorate in 2012 though the exact figure is difficult to quantify, also have a more negative view of immigration: nearly half (47%) of whites without a college degree view immigrants as a burden on the country. even among those white, working-class voters who view immigrants as a burden, 50% say immigrants from muslim countries are good people compared with 35% who say they are not.  there is also a partisan divide: white, working-class democrats are more likely to hold positive views about immigrants from muslim countries than their white, working-class republican counterparts. 47% of white democrats without college degrees say muslim immigrants increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the us compared with 83% of white republicans with no college degree. trump has made his hard line against muslims a key component of his campaign, and his white, working-class supporters have strong views about the impact of immigrants from muslim countries. fifty-three percent of white voters without college degrees who are considering supporting trump say immigrants from muslim countries are basically good, but 82% say they increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the us. 'under attack' more than 6-in-10 white, working-class americans also say that christian values are under attack in the united states. that viewpoint is more widespread among older working-class whites than among younger ones. seventy-three % of white, working class adults 65 and older said christian values are under attack, while just 41% of working-class adults under the age of 30 said the same. trump backers were more likely to say that christian values were under attack than those who support clinton. eighty-one percent of white, working-class voters who would consider supporting him in november said christian values were under attack, compared to 31% who support clinton. candidate positioning in the hours following the bombings in new york and new jersey, clinton and trump tussled over who was better qualified to combat terrorism as well as its cause.  clinton cast herself as the candidate best prepared to combat terrorism and said that her opponent's positions are "not grounded in fact" and "meant to make some kind of demagogic point." "i am prepared to, ready to actually take on those challenges," the former secretary of state told reporters on monday, "not engage in a lot of irresponsible, reckless rhetoric." trump blamed clinton and president barack obama for failing to keep the country safe and called for profiling to beef up what he sees as currently lackluster anti-terrorism efforts. instead of treading lightly, trump said on fox news monday morning, the better approach would be to "knock the hell out of 'em." "our local police, they know who a lot of these people are," trump told fox. "they are afraid to do anything about it, because they don't want to be accused of profiling. and they don't want to be accused of all sorts of things." the cnn/kff poll was conducted by telephone august 9 through september 5 among a nationally representative sample of 1,614 adults, including 701 people who were identified as working class whites -- white non-hispanic adults who do not currently hold a four-year degree and, if under age 25, not currently enrolled in school. results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, it is 5 points for results among members of the white working class, 6 points for whites with degrees, 10 points for black working class respondents and 9 points for the hispanic working class. full methodological details are available here.       poll: white working-class americans have complicated view of muslim immigrants      
__label__0 kenansville, north carolina (cnn)donald trump thinks black communities in the us are "absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before." trump made the comment as he rallied supporters here on tuesday and made his usual "what do you have to lose" pitch to african-american voters -- few of whom attended his rally in this rural part of this battleground state. "we're going to rebuild our inner cities because our african-american communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before. ever. ever. ever," trump said to approving nods from the nearly all-white crowd. "you take a look at the inner cities, you get no education, you get no jobs, you get shot walking down the street. they're worse -- i mean, honestly, places like afghanistan are safer than some of our inner cities," he continued. "and i think it's resonating." his comments came despite the fact that african-americans in the us have faced dramatically worse circumstances throughout history -- from slavery to jim crow laws. president barack obama, the first black us president, took on similar assertions by trump last saturday while speaking congressional black caucus gala. "you may have heard hillary's opponent in this election say that there's never been a worse time to be a black person. i mean, he missed that whole civics lesson about slavery or jim crow," obama had said. "but we've got a museum for him to visit, so he can tune in. we will educate him." in harsh rebuke of trump, obama referred to the businessman as "somebody who has fought against civil rights and fought against equality and who has shown no regard for working people most of his life." on trump's quest to win over african-american voters, obama quipped: "well, we do have challenges, but we're not stupid." the republican nominee has made a concerted effort to reach out to black voters over the last month, including visiting a predominantly black church in detroit, and visiting the water plant and a church in the majority-black city of flint, michigan. but his visit to flint was marred in controversy after the church's pastor interrupted trump to keep him from leveling political attacks. he was also met with hecklers there who called out his record as a landlord in new york, where he faced a civil rights lawsuit from the justice department in 1973 -- which trump settled -- alleging he discriminated against black tenants. critics have also panned trump's outreach to african-americans for painting the lives of black americans in broad-brushed and bleak terms. trump has argued that black voters should flock to his candidacy because he will "fix it" and has slammed his democratic rival hillary clinton for seeing black americans as votes, not as people -- even though she has a history of championing civil rights issues and more than 9-in-10 african-americans support clinton, according to recent polling. trump's support with african-americans stands in the low single digits according to recent national polls. despite his words aimed at drawing black voters to his campaign, trump on tuesday did not address the most police recent shooting of an unarmed african-african american man. terence crutcher, a 40-year-old black man, was shot by police friday night in tulsa, oklahoma. clinton addressed the shooting earlier tueaday on "the steve harvey morning show," calling it "unbearable" and arguing for the need to "tackle systemic racism."       trump: black communities in worst shape 'ever, ever, ever'      
__label__0 washington (cnn)the national rifle association is returning to the defense of donald trump in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign, a reminder of how fervently the gun-rights group has backed the republican nominee on television. the nra is launching a $5 million tv ad campaign tuesday, the group says, meant to turn out pro-second amendment voters at a time when trump is being attacked for his language about firearms. the gun lobby has aired $7.7 million in television time on trump's behalf, support that makes it the second-most active pro-trump advertiser in the general election. but it had not been on the airwaves since late last month. the nra's political victory fund is tasked with spending half the money on five swing states -- ohio, nevada, virginia, north carolina and pennsylvania -- while its institute for legislative action, its lobbying arm, is spending the second-half on national cable. all of the money is going to a harrowing ad that shows what the nra says would happen if hillary clinton appoints her chosen justices to the supreme court. "she'll call 9-1-1. average response time? 11 minutes," says the narrator as a sleeping woman is startled by nighttime footsteps. the woman runs to a nearby safe to grab her weapon, but it's empty. "don't let hillary leave you protected with nothing but a phone." the advertisements targets rural voters in battleground states who might be democrats or disillusioned republicans, according to jennifer baker, an nra spokeswoman. "it is designed to run up the score with those trump voters," she said. the nra's chief political adviser chris cox said the ad "underscores" how clinton's position on guns creates "one set of rules for her, and a different set of rules for the rest of us." trump has emerged as a proud spokesman for gun rights, though he has at times invited controversy. on multiple occasions, trump has been attacked for encouraging gun-owners to incite violence against clinton, though trump's campaign has said he is being misinterpreted. "i think her bodyguards should drop all weapons. disarm immediately," trump said in miami last week.

__label__0 (cnn)customs and border protection officers put information about ahmad khan rahami into a shared law enforcement agency database and sent a notice about him after interviewing rahami at the airport when he returned from a year-long trip to pakistan and afghanistan in 2014, a us law enforcement official told cnn tuesday. rahami was flagged for secondary screening when he came back from the trip. it was not the first time customs and border protection agents had pulled him aside for extra scrutiny after traveling to that region. the official said the information he provided about visiting his family was put into a database that can be accessed by other law enforcement agencies, noting this is routine procedure. additionally, the official says customs and border protection sent a report about rahami to the fbi and other agencies in 2014 as someone who investigators should be aware of given his travel and the amount of time spent in areas associated with terrorist groups. a federal law enforcement official familiar with the information sent to the fbi said rahami's information was part of a bulletin regarding a "batch" of people who traveled to high-risk areas. "he was not singled out," the official said. the notice was sent to the fbi before august 2014, when the fbi was alerted by a tip that rahami's father called him a terrorist. the fbi would have had access to the information when they investigated the tip. eventually the case was closed after the father downplayed the concern. the official cautioned these bulletins are "pretty common." a senior law enforcement official estimated that "several dozens" of these individual reports are produced a week. if rahami had raised red flags during the actual interview fbi investigators would have been brought in for further questioning of him right there in the airport, the first official said. that did not happen, the official noted. the official explained that it was not what rahami said in interview but the fact he'd traveled multiple times to this region of concern that prompted the bulletin the official said rahami had certain rights as a naturalized us citizen and as a result could not be held longer unless there was good reason. the senior law enforcement official, explaining the process for secondary screening, said if additional concerns are raised during secondary screening, two additional steps can be taken. an interagency report with information about the traveler can be sent forward immediately to law enforcement and intelligence agencies or the information can be integrated into the customs and border protection's national targeting center's weekly report. if the concern is more serious, the screeners can refer the traveler to an investigation by the joint terrorism task force and the fbi. representatives from the task force are co-located at airports like jfk and newark due to the high volume of travelers that are a concern.       first on cnn: customs agency notified fbi, other agencies about rahami's overseas travel      
__label__0 washington (cnn)donald trump on monday reiterated his support for the controversial practice of racial profiling by police amid increasing threats to the homeland. "our local police -- they know who a lot of these people are. they are afraid to do anything about it because they don't want to be accused of profiling," trump said on fox news on monday. trump pointed to how israel used profiling and "done an unbelievable job." trump did not say on what attributes he would encourage police to profile possible suspects, but it's illegal for police to subject us persons to disparate treatment based on their race or other protected status. "they see somebody that's suspicious, they will profile," trump said. "look what's going on: do we really have a choice? we're trying to be so politically correct in our country, and this is only going to get worse." related: trump labels clinton 'weak and ineffective' in wake of bombings trump's campaign manager, kellyanne conway, disputed that trump meant police should start "racial" profiling. "i mean if authorities are going to look the other way, then at least we have a presidential candidate who is telling the americans who say, 'i'm are so tired of looking the other way' we don't have a vetting process, we don't have borders," she told cnn's erin burnett on "outfront" tuesday. "we have people so worried about political correctness that look at what this did the other night, people were injured." the man suspected in saturday's bombings in new york and new jersey was captured monday after a manhunt and shootout. ahmad khan rahami is suspected of bombings saturday in new york city and seaside park, new jersey, and is believed to be connected to pipe bombs found sunday night in elizabeth, new jersey, sources told cnn. republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell declined to comment on the issue of profiling tuesday. but trump's running mate, indiana gov. mike pence, defended trump's comments. "i think it's all about common sense," pence told msnbc's kelly o'donnell. "talking with law enforcement officers, they'll tell you that today they feel like they operate in an environment of political correctness, where they can't use common sense to be able to target resources and target their energies against individuals who would be the most likely potential threat to our families and to the safety of our communities." trump 'bets' terror suspect not on a watch list pence acknowledged the difficult balance between smart policing and respecting civil liberties, but cited rahami as an example of how political correctness can hinder law enforcement. the fbi said tuesday that rahami's father was interviewed after a tip alleging that he called his son a terrorist, but the fbi never investigated rahami or placed him on a fbi database of potential terrorists. "i don't know why that occurred but it smacks of the kind of political correctness and eggshells that law enforcement feels that they have to walk on in the environment that we're in today," pence said. "of course it can (go wrong and infringe upon people's rights), but we're talking about common sense profiling." cnn's evan perez, manu raju, daniella diaz and naomi lim contributed to this report.      donald trump defends racial profiling in wake of bombings      
__label__0 washington (cnn)republicans are preparing for the penalty phase of the 2016 election. the next republican civil war came into greater focus over the weekend when party chairman reince priebus threw a thinly veiled warning at former gop 2016ers who haven't yet endorsed donald trump: "get on board" or face penalties if you ever seek the presidency again. the nudge -- aimed at republicans such as john kasich, ted cruz and jeb bush -- was no off-the-cuff expression of frustration. several republican party chairs in early voting states told cnn that priebus has spent days talking about enforcing the pledge that all 17 gop candidates signed at the outset of the 2016 primary to support the eventual nominee. find out all you need to know for the 2016 election on "the daily dc" podcast "i can't tell you how many people have asked me, 'what are you going to do about these candidates that are not keeping their promise?'" iowa gop chairman jeff kaufmann told cnn monday. he said the iowa state gop receives 10 to 20 calls per week from rank-and-file republicans wondering what, specifically, the party will do to force kasich, cruz and bush to stick to their pledges and back trump. "if i'm hearing it here from a state of 3 million, it must a megaphone there in dc," said kaufmann, who has spoken with priebus and other republican officials about enforcing the pledge. "there's no wiggle room in terms of what that promise was, and it should be honored." a representative for priebus didn't comment on the conversations. but his call for penalties wasn't widely embraced -- with the no. 2 house republican breaking with priebus tuesday morning. "there's a better way to unite people. i'm not a big believer that punishment unites people," house majority leader kevin mccarthy told reporters at a weekly session in the capitol. the california republican added, "if hillary (clinton) can't unite republicans, i don't think anything can." premature conversation? of course, talk of penalties on candidates who might run in 2020 could be all for naught if trump wins. the race between trump and clinton has narrowed dramatically in recent weeks, though the democratic nominee still has more paths to the white house. but the episode underscores the frenzy that could consume the gop if trump loses the race and the party searches for a new direction. the anatomy of a white, working-class trump voter "we're watching the trailer for the gop civil war, out in theaters november 9," said a top republican strategist, who asked not to be named to avoid openly feuding with priebus. the penalty talk spilled into the open sunday, when priebus told john dickerson on cbs' "face the nation" that members of the 2016 republican presidential field who haven't yet abided by their pledge to back the eventual nominee and endorsed trump need to "get on board." and for those who don't, he said future presidential bids won't "be that easy." "if a private entity puts forward a process and has agreement with the participants in that process, and those participants don't follow through with the promises that they made in that process," priebus said, "what should a private party do about that if those same people come around in four or eight years?" kasich's camp quickly zipped off a response accusing priebus of putting party over principles. kasich strategist john weaver said the ohio governor "will not be bullied by a kenosha political operative that is unable to stand up for core principles or beliefs." cruz brushed priebus off tuesday evening. "these are serious times. i think the last thing we need to worrying about is bickering between republicans," he said. "my focus is on defeating hillary clinton and helping preserve a senate republican majority." the rnc's leverage penalties, several republicans said, would likely come from the national party in the form of restrictions on access to the republican national committee's data and voter files -- and potentially bans from primary debates. individual states, though, likely couldn't keep candidates off their ballots. still, republicans cautioned that talk of penalizing pledge-breakers is aimed at nudging kasich, cruz, bush and others to support trump in 2016 -- not to handicap the party's presidential candidates in the future. some said it's not even clear the rnc would have authority to impose the crackdown priebus discussed. "reince has simply posed a question to which there is no good answer yet -- and i'm not sure that the question deserves an answer. that's to be determined," said matt moore, the south carolina gop chairman. rnc spokeswoman lindsay walters declined to address the possibility of penalizing future presidential candidates who didn't abide by their pledges to support trump. "we are focused on winning back the white house and maintaining our majorities in the house and senate," walters said in an email. donald trump opens the personal insult vault (again) while some party honchos like kaufmann backed priebus' warning shot, others -- including ohio gop chairman matt borges -- bristled. "no. this is not what we are all about as a party. besides, let's stay focused on 2016 for the next 50 days," borges tweeted sunday night. top mitt romney 2012 strategist stuart stevens tweeted: "so idea is most popular recent republican governors of battleground states should run as independents? great plan." rnc's handling of trump the rnc's handling of trump under priebus will be on trial as the party picks a new chair -- or extends the wisconsin operative's tenure -- shortly after the election. then comes a swing-state governor's race in virginia, followed by the midterm elections, where trump's brand of populism could butt against more orthodox conservatives. and in 2020, the early stages of the republican primary would be defined by how the candidates treated trump. it would be the clearest differentiator of like-minded conservatives like mike pence, the indiana governor who became trump's running mate and chief defender, and cruz, the texas senator who was booed off stage for refusing to endorse trump at his own nominating convention. "assuming trump loses, there'll be a really pitched battle for the heart and soul of the party," said weaver, the kasich strategist who wrote the scathing rebuttal to priebus on sunday. "you're going to have off-year elections, you're going to have midterms -- some of that will impact the defining of the party, clearly. but you won't have any new definition of it until there's a new nominee," weaver said. "there's a broader debate ultimately about what the party stands for and where the country should go." adelson to spend at least $45 million on 2016 races in boost for gop many republicans still fault priebus for failing to criticize trump forcefully enough in late 2015, when he proposed a clearly unconstitutional ban of all muslims from entering the united states, and believe the party could have done more to slow trump's rise. they point out a particular irony: the party that insisted it couldn't intercede in the 2016 nominating contest is now threatening to use its leverage to undercut individual candidates in future races. saul anuzis, a former michigan gop chairman who helmed cruz's state effort in the primary, defended pledge-breaking candidates, arguing that "circumstances change" -- a reference to the pledge's creation as a tool to keep trump from launching an independent campaign. he said he doesn't see how priebus could impose penalties on future presidential candidates. "there's no provisions in the rnc rules that allow anybody to punish anybody," anuzis said. "the idea of doing that, i think, is extremely difficult, because you normally are looking toward the future, not the past." cnn's deirdre walsh and manu raju contributed to this report.      the gop's next civil war is brewing      
__label__0 washington (cnn)the battle over gun rights returned to the nation's capital tuesday, as a federal appeals court took up a challenge to a restriction that requires applicants for a license to carry a concealed firearm to demonstrate a "good reason" to fear injury to his or her person or property. "this is the most important question in the second amendment today," said adam winkler of ucla school of law. "whether people can carry guns in public and under what conditions is a major battleground." lawyers for district of columbia called the license restriction an "important public safety law" and argued before a panel of the us district court for the district of columbia that the law should be allowed to remain in effect pending appeal. "this case is in its infancy," said holly m. johnson, an assistant attorney general for the district. but challengers asked the court to block it, arguing that "very few people" will be able to demonstrate that they are eligible for the permit. the three judges hearing the challenge were all nominated by republican presidents. judge thomas griffith, a george w. bush nominee, asked by far the most questions on the bench. he noted there is a "long history" of courts sustaining bans on concealed carry, but, joined by judge stephen williams, a ronald reagan appointee, he repeatedly questioned the scope of the dc permit requirement. more than once he asked about someone who lived in a dangerous neighborhood but had never been attacked who might not qualify for the permit. griffith asked whether someone had to be "attacked first." griffith noted that only a handful of other states have similar laws. the third judge, karen henderson, a george h. w. bush nominee, did not ask a question. one of biggest cases since heller eight years ago, it was another washington gun ordinance that triggered a landmark supreme court opinion -- district of columbia v. heller -- that held for the first time that the second amendment protects an individual's right to bear arms. the opinion capped off a decades-long debate on whether the right applied only in connection to service in a state militia. back in 2008, the law at issue concerned a total ban on handguns in the home. tuesday's case deals with weapons outside the home. gun rights advocates thought that heller -- penned by the late justice antonin scalia -- would encourage courts to strike down restrictions across the country. that didn't happen. instead, many courts relied upon a different part of scalia's opinion where he cautioned that the second amendment should not be understood as conferring a "right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose." meanwhile, the supreme court has declined to take up any follow-up cases. how scalia will be replaced has become a major issue in the presidential race. donald trump has pledged to appoint conservative justices in the mold of scalia. trump's gop primary rival, ted cruz, consistently name-checked the heller decision. hillary clinton has advocated for stronger gun control laws. meanwhile, president barack obama's nominee for the bench, judge merrick garland, waits on the sidelines. the dc law at issue in tuesday's case is based on similar provisions in new york, maryland and new jersey. several plaintiffs are challenging the law, including matthew grace, who says he was denied a permit in 2016 because he had failed to show a "good or proper reason" to support his request for a license. he owns four lawfully registered handguns and seeks to carry them outside the home for self-defense. grace's case and a similar one brought by different plaintiffs split two different district court judges reviewing the law. the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia will hear both appeals on tuesday. "the district of columbia has spent the last four decades trying to drain the second amendment of any meaning," charles cooper, a lawyer representing grace and other plaintiffs, argued in court papers. cooper objects to the fact that dc officials have given themselves the power to decide "on a case-by-case basis" whether an applicant has "good reason" to obtain a license to carry a concealed gun. he says that such a power is "categorically irreconcilable" with the second amendment. "nearly a decade after heller, the district of columbia still refuses to treat the right to bear arms as a genuine constitutional right," he said. in their briefs, lawyers for the district of columbia point out that washington is "unique" in that it is filled with thousands of high ranking federal officials, and diplomats and it hosts hundreds of heavily attended events annually including political marches and protests. citing supreme court precedent, they argue that the "second amendment preserves the ability of local jurisdictions to devise solutions to social problems that suit local needs and values, and that is precisely what the council has done through the 'good reason' standard." dc is supported by lawyers for the brady center to prevent gun violence, who emphasize that from 2014 to 2015, the homicide rate in the district increased 54%. "the district may meet or surpass that tragic record in 2016," jonathan lowy, an attorney for the brady center, argued in briefs. he pointed out that in one dc area -- ward 7 -- homicides have tripled so far this year. "it is critical that law enforcement maintain its longstanding authority to prevent the rampant carrying of guns in public places," lowy said in an interview. "it would be an extraordinary and radical shift for a court to find that law enforcement has no authority to reasonably regulate the carrying of hidden handguns in public." but the national rifle association counters that while dc officials are "rightly concerned about violent crime," the "constitution affords them considerable discretion in addressing the problem. " "the second amendment's protection of the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms' necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table." nra's lawyer paul clement argued in court briefs. "municipal leaders, no matter how well-intentioned, cannot simply enact any gun control law that they deem to be reasonable."       gun rights debate returns to washington courtroom      
__label__0 washington (cnn)senate minority leader harry reid offered an explanation tuesday for why donald trump won't disclose his tax returns: the republican presidential nominee is "faking his net worth." the nevada democrat -- and frequent trump foe -- levied the charge on twitter, evoking a similar claim he made against the gop's 2012 nominee, mitt romney. "trump is faking his net worth. he's not as rich as he would have us believe + a bad businessman. that's why we can't see his tax returns," reid tweeted. reid, citing an unnamed source, memorably accused romney during the 2012 race of going 10 years without paying federal income taxes. romney released a 20-year summary of his tax liabilities from 1990 through 2009, and his tax returns from 2010 and 2011. but he did not release additional returns. the trump campaign did not return cnn's request for comment. reid on tuesday then went to the senate floor to rip into trump. "the last thing the american people want or need is a president who will run another financial scam on each of them," the nevada democrat said. "if elected, donald trump would be the scammer in chief. trump is a fraud." "he's always looking for a mark, some victim for one of his schemes," reid added. "and now our country is trump's next target. he wants this to be his biggest payoff ever." reid's speech focused what he sees as lies about trump's money and said the real estate mogul is only wealthy because he was born with "a silver spoon." trump's father was a wealthy real estate magnate who loaned his son money to jumpstart his career. "litigation is nothing new to donald trump. over the last decade and a half, trump and his companies and have been sued in federal court 72 times. that doesn't take into consideration the many times he's been sued in state courts," reid said. "but trump being the flim-flammer he is just moves on to another scam." reid, who is supporting hillary clinton, has repeatedly attacked trump this campaign. following clinton's pneumonia diagnosis earlier this month, reid attacked trump's health. "take a look at this character that's running for president. he complains about her health. what does he do? he's 70 years old. he's not slim and trim. he brags about eating fast food every day. look at his health a little bit," reid said last week. and on thursday, reid tore into trump on the senate floor, calling the republican presidential nominee a "spoiled brat," "a con artist" and a "human leech who will bleed the country."       harry reid: donald trump 'faking his net worth'      
__label__0 (cnn)drawing enormous support from the state's non-white voters, hillary clinton holds a 5-point edge over donald trump in florida, according to a new poll from monmouth university out tuesday. the poll found clinton leading trump among likely voters in the crucial battleground, 46%-41%. libertarian party nominee gary johnson and green party nominee jill stein, both of whom will be on florida's ballot, drew 6% and 1%, respectively. monmouth's poll produced another unfavorable finding for trump: 54% of florida voters believe the gop nominee's recent turnabout on president barack obama's origins was made for political reasons. only 24% think trump believes that obama is a natural-born citizen. after years of promoting conspiracy theories regarding the first black president's birthplace, trump changed course last week. he still has plenty of work to do on that front in florida. according to the poll, clinton leads trump among hispanic, black and asian voters in the state, 69%-16%. those three blocs comprise one-third of florida's electorate. clinton's 5-point advantage is wider than other recent polls out of the state, including a cnn/orc survey released last week that found trump up by 3, within the poll's 3.5 percentage point margin of error. but it's smaller than her lead in the previous monmouth poll in florida last month, which showed clinton up by 9. that margin was also larger than other florida polls conducted at the time. the latest monmouth poll was conducted september 16-19 using phone interviews with 400 likely florida voters. it has a margin of error of 4.9%.       florida poll: clinton leads trump by 5 points      
__label__0 united nations (cnn)president barack obama took to the most prominent international stage tuesday to deliver a stark warning to american voters of the dire global consequences they face should they embrace isolationism and ultra-nationalism in november. never mentioning republican presidential nominee donald trump by name, the president's final address to the united nations general assembly was at heart an impassioned rebuke of the gop candidate's policies on trade, immigration and multiculturalism -- and a defense of liberalism and tolerance -- delivered 49 days before votes are cast for his replacement. he painted a dark picture of the future awaiting americans, and the world, if the forces of "aggressive nationalism" or "crude populism" win out. and he specifically inveighed against building a wall -- a centerpiece of trump's proposal on border security. "a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself," obama declared to the assembled representatives of the un's member states. gone were obama's idealistic appeals to bring about a world free of nuclear weapons and an agenda focused on peace, as were his previous un addresses. the "hope and change" of his argument as a presidential candidate himself was also replaced by exhortations against a future filled with chaos. "time and again human beings have believed they finally arrived at a period of enlightenment, only to repeat cycles of conflict and suffering. perhaps that's our fate," obama suggested. "we have to remember the choices of individual human beings led to repeated world war," obama said. "each of us as leaders, each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best. for we have shown that we can choose a better history." he pointed to growing divisions and discontent at home that challenge those decisions, and noted that the shortcomings of globalization had created "an uncertainty and unease and strife" that required acknowledgement, but not turning inward. "i believe that at this moment we all face a choice," obama said. "we can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration or we can retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion. i want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not back." it was obama's eighth and final address to the un body, which enthusiastically welcomed him in 2009 after he moved to reverse the unilateral approach of his predecessor george w. bush. in his speech that year, obama vowed to work within international bodies to confront the world's crises while pushing an agenda combating climate change and nuclear non-proliferation. but in the intervening years, the harsh realities of diplomacy settled in, both for obama and the un. the organization's inability to stem suffering in syria and ukraine laid bare the continued struggles to combat breaches of international law, while obama's own work toward combating violent extremists has failed to stop terrorist groups from committing atrocities. obama's address tuesday reflected those realities. he drew titters from the collection of world leaders and diplomats in the high-ceilinged general assembly hall when he noted that "at times both america's adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems were either caused by washington or could be solved by washington. and perhaps too many in washington believe that, as well." he made scant mention of individual world flash points, choosing instead to offer a more thematic recap of his foreign agenda. "the world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before. and yet our societies are filled with uncertainty and unease and strife," obama said. "despite enormous progress, as people lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult and tensions between nations become more quick to surface." related: clinton, trump meet world leaders for very different reasons obama continued his tradition at the un of acknowledging areas where the us has fallen short in its practice of democracy, saying his country and other developed nations must set a better example for emerging democracies. citing the pervasive role of money in politics, entrenched party allegiances and a patchwork of voting laws, obama said it was up to long-established nations to show the way forward. "those of us who believe in democracy, we need to speak out forcefully. because both the facts and history is on our side," obama said. "we better strive harder to set a better example at home." obama used his own efforts to help revive a stalled economy as an example of us leadership during his tenure, saying other countries would be wise to follow his lead of going after corruption and unfair tax policies. he also cited the deal with iran to curtain its nuclear program, and reopening of ties with cuba and myanmar, as examples of a successful global approach. related: global leaders at un tackle world's worst to-do list but the array of places where obama's approach hasn't yielded the outcomes he projected during his first appearance here in 2009 were also unavoidable. that includes his inability to negotiate peace between israel and the palestinians -- a major topic in his first four un addresses that was entirely absent during last year's speech. this year, the president took issue with both sides' actions toward one another. he criticized israeli settlements, saying the only path to mideast peace will come when the two sides reconcile deeply held differences. palestinians must "reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of israel," obama said. but he also said peace won't come until "israel recognizes it cannot permanently occupy and settle palestinian land." obama plans to meet israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on wednesday to "discuss the need for genuine advancement of a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict in the face of deeply troubling trends on the ground," according to white house press secretary josh earnest. another persisting crisis -- russia's continued incursion into ukraine -- also drew obama's attention tuesday. "in a world that left the age of empire behind, we see russia attempting to recover lost glory through force," obama said. "if russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it may be popular at home. it may fuel nationalist fervor for a time. over time, it's also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure." indeed, many of his harshest warnings were aimed at global government practices that damage democracy and liberalism and called for the rejection of strongmen, authoritarian and tribalism. "there appears to be growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now," he told the assembled leaders.

__label__0 washington (cnn)with two months to go before election day, democrats have the cash advantage in the race for the white house, but republicans have the cash advantage in the race for the senate. presidential campaigns and their supportive super pacs filed new numbers tuesday that continue to show clinton's cash lead in the homestretch of the presidential race. clinton's campaign raised $59.5 million and had about $68 million on hand at the end of august; trump's raised $41.7 million and had $50.2 million on hand. meanwhile, a cadre of republican donors -- most prominently, sheldon adelson -- are keeping republicans competitive in down-ballot races. here are the five takeaways from the money race: hillary clinton is very dependent on a few billionaires under-noticed in this campaign have been the very few democratic billionaires who are responsible for clinton's advertising machine: priorities usa. the super pac had a record-breaking month, collecting $23.4 million during summer's dog days. the bulk of the money is from a select few: fred eychaner and daniel abraham, who gave $3 million each, george soros, who donated $2.5 million, don sussman, who kicked in another $2 million, and laurene powell jobs, whose llc contributed another $2 million. those five people are responsible for a majority of the money that priorities usa has raised, and their names have littered democratic campaign finance reports for the entire 2016 race. trump doesn't have donors of similar sizes, and that's why his super pacs have failed to keep pace. only one new name appeared on trump's pac's reports: cherna moskowitz, who gave $1 million to a group run by close trump allies (and billionaires) bob and rebekah mercer. what's clinton's money good for? ads clinton has enjoyed a fundraising advantage over trump for the entire campaign, and it's allowed her to build an organization that trump could not. the democratic nominee spent almost $50 million last month -- way more than she spent during any other month -- and that's due to $33 million in "media buys." that's more than six times as much as they spent on payroll costs. and her campaign, joint fundraising committees and priorities usa had $194 million on hand, meaning plenty of more ads are coming. she's still struggling with small donors: only $8.4 million of the money she raised last month if from donors who gave $200 or less. trump is finally raising the big bucks despite record spending in the month of august -- including a hefty amount on its digital firm -- trump still entered the month with over $50 million on hand. trump collected $12 million from small-dollar donors who gave directly to his campaign, and he himself added another $2 million to his own bid. $20.2 million came from his joint committees with the republican national committee. trump finally began advertising in the month of august, and it's reflected in his campaign finance report. he spent almost $30 million last month, $11.5 million more than he spent in any other month. the return of mike bloomberg the former new york city mayor remains the most prominent political donor who hews to the center of the political aisle. his super pac, independence usa, has primarily focused on supporting candidates who support restrictions on firearms, and has emerged as a leading backer of pennsylvania sen. pat toomey. but he personally is backing the democratic ticket for president. the billionaire last month made his largest donation yet to his group: another $8.5 million from his personal fortune. that's his largest check ever to the super pac. senate republicans have the upper hand thanks to $21.5 million from the adelsons, groups backing senate republicans have more to spend in the homestretch than do those backing senate democrats. the senate leadership fund, an allied group in new hampshire, and the koch brothers' super pac, freedom partners action fund, raised $32.5 million in august. that also doesn't include various groups that aren't required to disclose their donors, such as the us chamber of commerce or other koch nonprofit groups. and the democrats? the main senate groups -- senate majority pac, emily's list and the league of conservation voters -- took in only $20.5 million. environmental activist tom steyer on tuesday pledged another $15 million to his joint effort with labor unions to develop a coordinated ground game for the democratic ticket. but here's what we do know now: the democrats don't have an adelson equivalent. their main senate donor last month is facebook co-founder dustin moskovitz, who along with his wife gave $5 million of the $20 million he has pledged to spend in 2016. in the senate cash race, adelson is a game-changer.       five takeaways from clinton and trump's big money month      
__label__0 (cnn)donald trump jr., the candidate's eldest child, emerged early on as one of his father's most ferocious advocates and polished surrogates. but the shine is coming off after a series of damaging missteps -- the latest coming when he likened syrian refugees to skittles candy. trump jr.'s lightly filtered twitter account has at times appeared to be a clearinghouse for particularly unsavory media and commentary. on tuesday, for instance, he retweeted a breitbart story titled, "europe's rape epidemic: western women will be sacrificed at the altar of mass migration." here are a few the son's latest stumbles: compared syrian refugees to skittles "if i had a bowl of skittles and i told you just three would kill you. would you take a handful? that's our syrian refugee problem." at least, that's how donald jr., among others, would describe it. while many trump supporters offered their support, the tweet provoked a broader backlash. mars candy eventually chimed in to distance themselves from the message. "skittles are candy; refugees are people," the company said in a statement. "it's an inappropriate analogy. we respectfully refrain from further comment, as that could be misinterpreted as marketing." read: what corporate america can learn from skittles' response to donald trump jr. the moral question aside, washington post reporter philip bump pointed out a math problem. according to a recent cato institute report, the odds "that an american would be killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee was 1 in 3.64 billion a year." as bump explains, the tweet could -- with the framing only slightly altered -- be interpreted as an argument for letting in more refugees. still, the campaign insists trump jr. has been "a tremendous asset" all the way through. "speaking the truth might upset those who would rather be politically correct than safe," trump campaign spokesman jason miller told cnn in an email. "but the american people want a change, and only donald trump will do what's needed to protect us." gave a new reason why trump hasn't shared his taxes donald trump is on track to be the first modern presidential candidate withhold his tax information. the candidate and the campaign have for months said their reason for keeping a lid on the returns was an ongoing audit. but in an interview last week with the pittsburgh tribune-review, trump jr. gave a very different explanation. the decision was made, he said, because trump has "got a 12,000-page tax return that would create ... financial auditors out of every person in the country," and have them "asking questions that would distract from (his father's) main message." while there is no law preventing trump from making the returns public, audit or not, trump jr.'s comment reflected what critics have been saying for months: that this is and always has been a political calculation. 'gas chamber' reference complaining about media coverage is part of almost every campaign's playbook. references to "the gas chamber" are not. during an interview with philadelphia-based conservative talk radio host chris stigall, he first described the press as the clinton campaign's "number one surrogate." but then, this: "they've let her slide on every indiscrepancy (sic), on every lie, on every dnc game trying to get bernie sanders out of the thing. i mean, if republicans were doing that, they'd be warming up the gas chamber right now. it's a very different system -- there's nothing fair about it." the campaign denied that trump jr. was making a holocaust reference -- the nazis used gas chambers as a tool of their world war ii-era genocide -- and that the comment, a bit of hyperbole, was really about capital punishment more generally. "the liberal, dishonest media is so quick to attack one of the trumps that they never let the truth get in the way of a good smear," trump spokesman jason miller said in a statement. the anti-defamation league, a prominent jewish advocacy group, was less sure. "trivialization of the holocaust and gas chambers is never okay," they tweeted at trump jr. clinton's campaign was especially biting, turning its response into an attack on trump the candidate, with chairman john podesta saying the son's language is "probably pretty consistent with the type of rhetoric he heard around the house growing up." posting image of alt-right mascot 'pepe the frog' with trump as clinton was feeling the fallout from her "basket of deplorables" comment -- in which she initially suggested that half of trump's supporters fit in a group composed of the "racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, islamaphobic, you name it" -- trump jr. made headlines with a controversial instagram post. the photoshop composition featured his father leading a band of "deplorables," with political allies and the cartoon "pepe the frog" by his side. what trump jr. later said he did not know, was that "pepe" has been appropriated as a mascot and preferred meme of the white supremacist alt-right movement. asked about the post by abc news on sunday, trump jr. pleaded ignorance. "i've never even heard of pepe the frog," he said. "i had no idea there was any connotation there." promotes anti-clinton conspiracies his father's feed might get more attention, but trump jr. is just as active -- and sometimes more controversial. he often retweets the actor james woods, who frequently shares suspect anti-clinton media. "what is wrong with her?" woods asked in a recent tweet, shared by trump jr., that quoted another user who wrote: "breaking!!! collapsing hillary clinton heavily sedated as she responds to donald trump comment & #chelsea !! #valium" after a recent nbc news forum, trump jr. retweeted a post from right wing radio host john cardillo, who was among the conspiracy theorists saying clinton had been wearing an earpiece during the event. "well look at that," cardillo wrote. "last night #crookedhillary gets caught with #hillarysearpiece. today a new ear covering hairdo." shared some choice thoughts on a 'herd of mothers' a look back at trump jr. in the pre-campaign days yielded some tasteless commentary on motherhood and a family employee. "ever notice that if u get a herd of mothers together they aren't physically capable of talking about anything but birth pregnancy & diapers?" he asked in july 2011. about a year later, he offered this gem on the devotion of a particular employee, who trump jr. said skipped a family wedding to be at work. "at dinner w our greenskeeper who missed his sister's wedding 2 work (luv loyalty 2 us) "no big deal hopefully she'll have another someday";)" trump jr. tweeted.       donald trump jr. steps in it again (and again)      
__label__0 (cnn)michelle obama on tuesday joked about the plagiarism controversy that engulfed melania trump during the republican national convention, delivering a dry retort when "the late show" host stephen colbert asked the first lady if she was sympathetic to the plight of a fellow political spouse. "melania trump was criticized for using what turned out to be a portion of your speech -- but do you have any sympathy? because there are people around her creating things, and you know, i have sympathy for her. do you understand how that might be sympathetic, for what happened to her?" the cbs host asked. "yeah, that was tough," obama deadpanned, prompting laughs from the audience. colbert also asked the first lady if she was sympathetic to political spouses who are required to stand behind partners whose political beliefs are antithetical to their own -- a premise obama flatly rejected. "do you have any sympathy for the people who have to go there and stand by the person running for president?" "no," obama replied. "because if -- you know, you have to be, you know, in it. if you're in it, and if you don't agree, you should have agreed before they ran. bottom line is, if you didn't agree with what barack was saying, i would not support his run. so i stand there proudly, and i hope they are, too, standing with their spouses proudly. so no, no sympathy." during her appearance on the show, obama also joked around with colbert, climbing into a blanket fort with the host (a recurring segment on the show) to discuss serious issues, like investment in education for young girls around the world, and less serious ones -- such as when a conversation about healthy eating turned into a joke about how eating too many carrots can turn someone orange. "and if you turn really orange, you have to start saying crazy things and run for president," colbert cracked.       first lady michelle obama jokes about melania trump plagiarism: 'yeah, that was tough'      
__label__0 atlanta (cnn)rev. raphael warnock crouched forward in a back pew here at ebenezer baptist church and wondered what could have been. "i'm not afraid of johnny isakson," said warnock of his republican senator, at times distracted by the decades-old, muffled recordings of martin luther king jr.'s sermons that echoed in this historic sanctuary. "i'm not interested in a symbolic candidacy. i would've run to win." a few hours later, the democrat who is challenging isakson instead of him, jim barksdale, tried to evince that same optimism speaking to a group of supporters at a tex-mex restaurant in gwinnett county. "this is a winnable election. don't let anyone tell you anything else," said barksdale, a 63-year-old soft-spoken investment manager and political newcomer. "i wouldn't be in it if i didn't think it was winnable." barksdale, however, trails isakson by 16 points in a monmouth university poll released monday, even though donald trump is up only 3 points ahead of hillary clinton. georgia is looking increasingly like a missed opportunity for democrats trying to win back the senate -- and many fault barksdale himself. "we were giving a godsend, i believe, with donald trump," said barksdale supporter leonard ware as he waited for the candidate to speak in gwinnett. "if we had a stronger candidate, we could've taken that senate seat." georgia poll: donald trump, hillary clinton in tight race for national democrats, barksdale's disappointing bid is part of a broader trend facing the party that came into 2016 with a favorable map of senate races. in ohio, ted strickland has been hampered by repeated gaffes and fundraising woes that have led national democrats to essentially abandon a once-top candidate in the homestretch. democrats have begun to make similar moves in florida, where patrick murphy -- once a young, impressive recruit poised to flip a gop seat -- has suffered dearly for embellishing his background and given republican opposition researchers a trove of material. and here in georgia, a half-dozen prominent democrats passed on challenging isakson, a decision that some in the party now rue. even with the tight presidential race, barksdale isn't trying to capitalize on any anti-trump sentiment in georgia. he didn't mention the gop presidential candidate when meeting supporters campaigning friday and barely addressed it until cnn asked him about the top of the ticket in an interview. that's a far cry from the democratic playbook that has proved to be moderately successful in other senate races. democrats have tortured gop incumbents like ron johnson in wisconsin and richard burr in north carolina for their embrace of the nominee, and the poll numbers show it. part of his reticence is that barksdale, a former bernie sanders-backer, says he believes there are issues where he agrees with trump. and he predicted a slew of barksdale-trump voters this november. "it's hard to imagine how somebody can pull the lever for donald trump on the republican side -- who is so anti-the-establishment and anti-the-trade-things -- and then pull the lever for johnny isakson," barksdale said. african-american gap georgia democrats have long seen their political viability as resting on the state's booming minority population, and barksdale's campaign agrees. if he can consolidate the black vote and win 85% of the community's 2.1 million voters, barksdale aides say, he can win. the problem, revealed in a walk along this city's historically african-american sweet auburn neighborhood: people don't know who he is. "black dude?" asked paul jones, a registered democrat sitting on a ledge outside an abandoned park here, asked about the white barksdale. "oh, no, i don't know him." some here do know isakson, and he is a revered figure in some pockets of georgia's middle class. at a major republican call center in isakson's home base of cobb county last week, nearly everyone calling on his behalf have some personal relationship with the two-term senator -- whether they teach his granddaughter at sunday school or write to his personal email every few weeks. and a trio of prominent democrats, former us sen. sam nunn, former gov. roy barnes, and current us rep. david scott have all publicly backed isakson, snubbing their own nominee. despite trump's struggles -- especially among independent women in the suburbs -- isakson's team is calm and confident, thanks primarily to the caliber of the man they are facing. their main concern is how much barksdale himself plans to invest his campaign. he has invested $3 million so far, and he declined repeated questions about how high that total would go. "no question that our democratic friends are kicking themselves, given how volatile the electorate has become, for not having recruited a candidate with a higher profile with a better set of policies and messages," said heath garrett, isakson's chief strategist said at their campaign office. "the flip is -- they have a candidate that's willing to write a check," added campaign manager trey kilpatrick. man in the hat aside from not going after trump, barksdale has had other missteps that have cost him. the list of grievances among georgians against barksdale is long: the time conservative radio ridiculed him for misspelling 'judgment' on his campaign website; his sparse public event and interview schedule, stripping him of needed exposure; and his inability to effectively consolidate the democratic base. barksdale is further to the left than the centrist senate bid waged by michelle nunn in 2014, who was thought to be a good ideological fit for georgia despite being walloped in an open-seat contest. his calling card -- the cotton bailey flat caps that he wears each day -- has drawn criticism as well from georgia power brokers. "i get a lot of compliments on it," he said. "everybody was worried that it wouldn't appeal within the, let's call it, minority communities -- but it really does." the cap has emerged as the signature emblem of barksdale's laggard campaign, with one soft-focus television ad featuring georgians securing his cap over their hair ("could i give you a good look here?" he told one grade-schooler here before revealing his balding head.) his office in littered in cap imagery, with supporters imploring republicans to "send the hat" -- not barksdale, or as some call him more forgivingly, "the man in the hat" -- to the senate. national republicans don't send trackers to his events and have barely advertised against him as well. republicans concede that isakson would have faced a stronger test if atlanta mayor kasim reed, or rising star state rep. stacey abrams, or presidential scion jason carter, had not so strongly resisted overtures from party leadership to run a race seen as winnable. "i had conversations with folks who were thoughtful about their request, and i was speedy in my response," said abrams as she awaited a flight. "i was very unequivocal about the fact that i had no interest in running for the senate." "i thought seriously about it and i came this close to running," said warnock, who said he wanted to remain at his church. "this was not my time." several democrats pointed to trends that explained democrats' candidate problems nationally -- poor showings in 2014 sapped ambition from some red-state hopefuls, while others made their decisions well before trump's struggles. democrats did not land their first-choice recruit in north carolina, and others have not lived up to the hype that came with their entrances into the race. "when you look at states like north carolina, missouri and indiana -- which were places that no one thought were going to be competitive this time last year -- i think it speaks to the quality of the candidates that came forward," said dscc spokesman lauren passalacqua, who would only characterize georgia as "another area that we think is competitive in a year when republican have struggled." isakson, for his part, takes some credit for the democrats' a-team declining to challenge him. "i've made a lot of friends. and i try to represent all the people when i'm in office," he said in an interview. "i'm grateful they decided to stay where their careers were." run-off in january? the biggest challenge for isakson at this point is getting to 50% -- the number he needs to avoid a run-off in january. the monmouth poll has him at exactly that mark -- with a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points. isakson aides predict a runoff would cost each side more than $20 million, and it could become a national spectacle should control of the senate hang in the balance. "if johnny gets into a general election runoff, there will be money from all over the country that's going to pour into georgia," said eric tanenblatt, a longtime republican fundraiser and power player here in the state. "if hillary clinton were to win the white house, does she come down here to campaign for barksdale?" but that may be the democrats' best hope at this point. "i was not the likeliest candidate," barksdale said. "if anyone else had gotten involved that i thought i was credible, i would've certainly let them carry the water instead of me."       in georgia, democrats don't offer their best in battle to retake senate      
__label__0 (cnn)a group of 375 "concerned" scientists -- including famed physicist stephen hawking -- released an open letter tuesday sharply criticizing donald trump, citing the threat of climate change and blasting his push for the us to leave the paris accord. "it is of great concern that the republican nominee for president has advocated u.s. withdrawal from the paris accord. a 'parexit' would send a clear signal to the rest of the world: 'the united states does not care about the global problems of human-caused climate change. you are on your own,'" the group wrote on the website responsiblescientists.org. the use of the term "parexit" is a reference to a political withdrawal along the lines of the uk's vote to leave the european union, commonly called the "brexit." they continued, "the consequences of opting out of the global community would be severe and long-lasting -- for our planet's climate and for the international credibility of the united states." the letter is signed by a number of famous scientists, including hawking and nobel prize-winning physicist steven chu, who served as secretary of energy under president barack obama. cnn reached out to the trump campaign for a response to the letter, but did not immediately receive a response. the paris agreement was reached by 195 countries at the united nations climate change conference in paris in 2015, aimed at coordinating global efforts to combat climate change. obama was a main proponent of the agreement, and democratic nominee hillary clinton supports its ongoing implementation. the group slammed politicians who deny the existence of man-made climate change. "during the presidential primary campaign, claims were made that the earth is not warming, or that warming is due to purely natural causes outside human control. such claims are inconsistent with reality," they wrote. republican nominee donald trump opposes the agreement, and he has previously suggested that climate change is a hoax "created by and for the chinese." he recently said in an interview that "i am not a great believer in man-made climate change."       stephen hawking, 375 scientists slam trump for backing 'parexit'      
__label__0 new york (cnn)president barack obama confronted one of his most strained foreign partnerships wednesday during a final meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, the pair making a last attempt at patching up their stormy bond before obama leaves office. speaking before their session, obama said he was aiming to ascertain the prospects for peace in the region as he prepares to end his presidency. "our hope will be that in these conversations we get the sense of how israel sees the next few years, what the opportunities are and what the challenges are in order to ensure we keep alive the possibility of a stable, secure israel at peace with its neighbors," obama said. "these are challenging times. one thing that i would say about prime minister netanyahu is that he is always very candid with us." that candor has become a hallmark of the relationship between obama and his israeli counterpart, whom the white house has accused of being less-than-diplomatic in expressing his opposition to us policies like the nuclear agreement with iran. obama's 30-minute meeting wednesday with netanyahu was likely to be their final opportunity for face-to-face consultations before a new president enters the oval office in january. obama is intent on conferring solid ties with israel upon his successor, despite the personal animus that developed between him and netanyahu, as he looks to boost the relationship during the homestretch of a presidential campaign in which he hopes to see democratic nominee hillary clinton prevail. obama took a step toward solidifying the alliance this month by completing a long-term, $38 billion security aid package for israel, the largest such agreement ever for a us ally. the aid, obama said, "allows the kind of certainty in a moment where there's enormous uncertainty in the region. it is a very difficult and dangerous time in the middle east and we want to make sure israel has full capabilities to keep the israeli people safe." in their talks, obama said he and his israeli counterpart would discuss challenges in syria, and said he would get netanyahu's assessment of conditions in israel and the west bank. "clearly there is great danger of not just terrorism but also flare-ups of violence," he said. "we do have concerns about settlement activity as well." obama hopes to take steps in his final days in office to promote renewed talks between the israelis and the palestinians on peace, though his previous efforts toward reconciliation in the region have fallen short. "my hope is we can continue to be an effective partner in israel in finding a path to peace," obama said. but the white house remains opposed to israel's expanded settlement activity in the west bank, and has expressed disappointment at netanyahu's occasional skepticism about the viability of a two-state solution in the region. in the meeting wednesday obama raised "profound us concerns about the corrosive effect that that is having on the prospects of two states." "they've never papered over their differences," another senior administration official said of obama and netanyahu. in his final united nations address tuesday, obama made scant reference to the israel-palestine conflict, saying only that "israelis and palestinians will be better off if palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of israel, but israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle palestinian land." the passing remark was in stark comparison to the large amounts of time obama spent on the issue during addresses to the un earlier in his tenure. the shift reflected the now-frozen peace negotiations, which moved in spurts during obama's presidency but never materialized into a workable solution. the white house has conceded that talks aren't likely to resume while obama remains in office but has remained open to the possibility the president could take steps in the next months to ramp up pressure on both sides to work toward a two-state solution. "with respect to middle east peace, i wouldn't rule out the president taking any particular step on the issue," ben rhodes, obama's deputy national security adviser, said tuesday. "what i would say is his test has always been, can i make a positive difference by engaging on the israeli-palestinian issue? we've tried multiple tactics, none of them have succeeded, given the fact that the parties themselves have been unable to come together." obama's talks with netanyahu wednesday capped a tumultuous personal history, though both displayed a businesslike camaraderie during their photo-op. the low point between the two men came in march 2015, when netanyahu infuriated the white house by publicly lobbying against the iran nuclear deal before congress -- a move the administration lambasted as a breach of diplomatic protocol. netanyahu returned to washington last november in an attempt to repair the relationship, meeting with obama in the oval office and addressing both the conservative american enterprise institute and the left-leaning center for american progress, the think tank with ties to clinton. netanyahu on wednesday invited obama for a round of golf in israel once he departs office in january, saying warmly that obama's "influential voice" on international politics would remain a force "for many decades." "our alliance has grown decade after decade, through successive presidents, bipartisan congresses and with the overwhelming support of the american people," he said. "it is an unbreakable bond."       obama at netanyahu meeting: 'he is always very candid with us'      
__label__0 washington (cnn)rock star bono said republican presidential candidate donald trump has the potential to be "the worst idea that ever happened to america." "america is like the best idea the world ever came up with, but donald trump is potentially the worst idea that ever happened to america," he told cbs's charlie rose. "he could destroy it." "america is not just a country," bono continued in the interview that aired tuesday on "this morning." "america is an idea and that idea is bound up in justice and equality for all." the philanthropist and activist, who was in new york for the meeting of the united national general assembly, called trump's rise to prominence within the gop "really dangerous." "i think he's hijacked the party, and i think he's trying to hijack the idea of america and i think it's bigger than all of us. this is really dangerous," he said. however, bono did validate the concerns of trump supporters frustrated with the status quo of the two leading political parties. "i would not diminish trump supporters or underestimate their angst because i feel that in a way they have correctly assessed that the center parties haven't yet become clear," he said. "their angst is real and genuine." the irish musician declined to tell americans how to vote, but said whatever voters decide will have global implications. "there are very real problems facing not just america, facing europe," he said. "i'm irish. i don't have a vote, and i can't be telling people how to vote. and i don't want to, but i have a voice and i can say who sits in that office affects everyone in this world."       bono: trump 'potentially the worst idea that ever happened to america'      
__label__0 (cnn)sen. mark kirk's campaign falsely asserted on its website that the illinois republican was a veteran of the iraq war, a misstatement that comes six years after exaggerations over his military record nearly cost him his state's senate seat. the republican, now battling for a second term in a tight race in illinois, stayed in the united states during the iraq war when he served in the navy reserves. but on a public webpage on his official campaign website touting his record on veterans' issues, kirk was listed as a "veteran of the iraq war." while kirk campaign officials said it was a staff error, the issue resembles the controversy that nearly caused his 2010 senate campaign to implode. moreover, kirk is now running for reelection against democratic rep. tammy duckworth, a military veteran who lost both of her legs during combat in iraq. kirk campaign officials said the webpage was not meant to be made public, saying that it was supposed to be a private site while edits were being made to the page. campaign officials said a third-party vendor had drafted the language that they said had not been vetted or reviewed by the senator's staff. the language, they acknowledged, was inaccurate, saying it would be changed when the campaign began a more direct push to court military veterans. after cnn inquired about the statement, the campaign moved the webpage behind a password-protected firewall. it had been accessible publicly and through google searches about kirk's work on veterans issues prior to that. kirk campaign manager kevin artl downplayed the error -- and instead attacked duckworth over her tenure leading the illinois department of veterans affairs. "rather than focus on draft web copy that has yet to go through an approval process, we would welcome the media's attention on the six military veterans who died waiting for care during tammy duckworth's time at the illinois department of veterans affairs," artl said. duckworth campaign officials declined to comment. in 2010, kirk came under heavy criticism for making a number of inaccurate comments about his military record, including falsely asserting he was the lone member of congress to serve in iraq and had been named the navy's intelligence officer of the year. he later backtracked, including by saying he served "during" the iraq war -- not "in" the war. he also later acknowledged that a different award was given by the navy, and it was awarded to his entire unit. kirk apologized for his misstatements, including one saying he had been fired on in 2000 while flying reconnaissance missions over iraq and another saying he was a veteran of operation desert storm in the early 1990s. during the iraq war invasion of 2003, kirk was a congressman representing a district encompassing suburbs north of chicago. he served in the naval reserves at that time but was working stateside, even joking to a reporter in 2003 that he wouldn't see combat unless the iraqi army came to washington. after a 23-year career in the navy reserves where he served as an intelligence officer, kirk retired from the service in 2013 -- a year after he suffered a major stroke that still affects his mobility and speech today.       mark kirk campaign site falsely calls senator 'veteran' of iraq war      
__label__0 (cnn)hillary clinton's campaign manager said wednesday that the democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in charlotte, north carolina and tulsa, oklahoma. "there are two prongs to her approach," robby mook, hillary for america campaign manager told cnn's alisyn camerota on "new day."

"these situations are handled by local policies currently. and what she is proposing is that we actually set up national standards so that localities have better policies to work with and train towards." clinton spoke out tuesday against "systematic racism" following the recent shooting of terence crutcher in tulsa, oklahoma. crutcher was shot and killed last week after his car broke down. the 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before officer betty shelby fatally shot him. crutcher was unarmed at the time. the charlotte-mecklenburg police department said wednesday that "approximately 12 officers" were injured during protests after the fatal shooting of keith lamont scott tuesday by a police officer. mook said the other part of clinton's plans involves working to improve the relationship between police and minorities. "the second piece is to restore bonds between communities and law enforcement, so investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the resources in the community to prevent something like this from happening," he said. clinton told radio host steve harvey on tuesday's "the steve harvey morning show" that she plans to speak "directly to white people" about implicit bias. mook said wednesday clinton meant she would explain that different ethnic groups are often treated differently in america. "what she's saying is our entire country needs to do some real soul-searching here. it is clear that the criminal justice system is not treating everybody the same way," he said. "if you are african-american or from a minority group, you may not be being treated the same as a white person. and that's a problem." related: yg seizes mantle of rap's most outspoken donald trump critic clinton said tuesday that while there are "good, honorable, cool-headed police officers" working across the country, "we can do better." "we have got to tackle systemic racism," clinton said. "this horrible shooting again. how many times do we have to see this in our country?" "this is just unbearable," clinton said. "and it needs to be intolerable." clinton later tweeted on the shooting, writing, "another unarmed black man was shot in a police incident. this should be intolerable. we have so much work to do. #terencecrutcher -h." related: road to 270 in response to the crutcher shooting, both the department of justice and state authorities have launched investigations into the officer-involved shooting. danny c. williams, us attorney of the northern district of oklahoma, said prosecutors will attempt to determine whether a federal civil rights violation had occurred. authorities refused to immediately answer additional questions due to the ongoing investigation. cnn's max blau and jason morris contributed to this report.      clinton plans to develop national standards to manage police shootings      
__label__0 (cnn)lawmakers hoping for a quick resolution in the talks to fund the government and provide a federal response to zika were disappointed monday when negotiators, who had worked through the weekend, said they would need more time to agree to a deal. "everything's a little up in the (air)," sen. john cornyn of texas, a member of the republican leadership told reporters crowded outside his office waiting for word of an agreement. "hope springs eternal." with no deal at hand, senate leaders delayed until at least tuesday a procedural vote to begin debate on the bill in hopes it might be ready then. in one sign of possible progress late monday, sen. chuck schumer of new york, who is a member of the democratic leadership, told reporters that negotiators had resolved a key sticking point over language in the zika measure that would prevent funds from going to a planned parenthood partner in puerto rico, something democrats strongly oppose. "yes, it's resolved," schumer told reporters. "the whole zika issue has been resolved." but a top senate gop leadership aide declined to confirm schumer's pronouncement. and about an hour before schumer spoke, sen. roy blunt of missouri, a senior republican in the talks, said it would be "very, very premature" for democrats to say the zika language had been resolved. "none of this done until it's all done," blunt said. some senators and aides of both parties predicted a hand-shake agreement on the overall deal could be reached as early as tuesday but others doubted the partisan divide could be bridged so quickly, especially since the deadline for the government to run out of money is not until the end of the month. with control of the senate up for grabs in november, gop leaders are anxious to wrap up the high-priority legislation and get their vulnerable members up for re-election home to campaign. democrats denied republican charges they were slow-walking a final agreement but privately acknowledged that they felt no pressure to accept a quick deal they didn't like just to let republicans go home to campaign. among the issues being negotiated, sen. ted cruz, r-texas, is pushing to add language to the government funding bill that would prevent the us from turning over to an international organization control over internet domain names. some democrats are pressing for changes to the export-import bank board to get around gop opposition to confirming open slots on the board, which is disrupting some operations of the bank. other issues include funding for flint, michigan's water supply problem, disaster aid for states hit my major flooding, disclosure requirements for political giving by corporations, and the number of hours truckers are allowed to drive in a week to limit driver fatigue. some gop lawmakers have been pushing for aid to help with damage caused by the recent louisiana flooding. but schumer suggested that both flint and louisiana would need to be addressed in a separate disaster aid package, saying the gop was blocking additional money for flint in the government funding package. "they want to do louisiana, we want to do flint," schumer said. "they don't want to do flint." negotiators are also working to get offsets for the cost of the $1.1 billion zika funding. democrats initially pressed for it all to be considered emergency funding but there were signs they were prepared to meet gop demands for some offsets.       still no deal on zika and government funding      
__label__0 washington (cnn)conservative megadonor sheldon adelson and his wife, miriam, have committed roughly $45 million so far to donald trump's presidential campaign and downballot republicans' attempt to control congress, according to a person familiar with adelson's thinking. the billionaire on tuesday will disclose having given $20 million to the senate leadership fund, a super pac linked to george w. bush hand karl rove and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell. a check of a similar size is expected to go to the congressional leadership fund, a similar super pac focused on the house of representatives. and to back trump, a donation of at least $5 million is likely headed to the political operation helmed by the ricketts family, who are expected to finally spend their fortunes on trump as well. other cash may be routed to ricketts-led nonprofit groups that are not required to disclose the funders. the spending amounts to a historic investment in the republican party ticket's hopes for november, putting millions of dollars behind trump's bid in a groundbreaking donation that could redefine the final two months of the 2016 campaign. the donation, the adelsons' first major gifts of the entire 2016 cycle, puts an end to questions about how they would spend their fortunes in the republican race. courted by the entire republican field during the primary, adelson has been the most prolific republican financier in recent cycles and bar none the most influential contributor in the donor class. their decision could convince other major gop donors to give as well, which would be a major boon for trump. the real estate mogul has wooed adelson throughout the year but had not convinced him to open his wallet. the chair of las vegas sands casinos, adelson signaled earlier this year that he would give $100 million to pro-trump efforts, though he has yet to part with a single dime. the billionaire gave at least $93 million to conservative groups in the 2012 election. after sitting out of the republican primary, adelson became the most prominent megadonor to quickly support trump, but he resisted months of pitches from pro-trump operatives to finance their groups, which today still struggle to fund television campaigns. adelson has also been courted strongly by american crossroads, a network of super pacs. the senate leadership fund is one of those crossroads groups and will report tuesday having raised $28 million in august, shattering fundraising records and injecting new optimism into the gop's efforts to hold the senate. the congressional leadership fund or ricketts groups will not be required to disclose the donations until mid-october.       first on cnn: adelson to spend at least $45 million on 2016 races in boost for gop      
__label__0 trump is saying "yes" to fox news almost every day but saying "no" to most other major networks and news organizations -- a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. he called into "fox & friends" on monday morning, he is booked on "the o'reilly factor" monday night, and he has another town hall with sean hannity coming up on wednesday. rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for trump. if nothing else, it limits the candidate's exposure to hard-hitting questions -- while fueling frustration among journalists. trump's surrogates continue to say that he is more accessible than hillary clinton, but that is no longer true. newt gingrich knocked clinton at a trump rally on monday afternoon by saying "she doesn't do press conferences." but clinton has taken questions from reporters at half a dozen press conferences in the past two weeks, including as recently as monday morning. these sessions, while relatively short, have been plentiful, while trump has not held a press conference since july. trump beat reporters are starting to make noise about the drought — especially since trump made clinton's eight-month period without press conferences into a major campaign talking point. "it's been more than 50 days since donald trump held a press conference," david martosko of the daily mail tweeted monday. trump's recent tv appearances, on "the dr. oz show" and "the tonight show," made news, but not in journalistic settings. the washington post's robert costa had a newsmaking interview with trump last week. but that's the exception to the rule. the new york times last had an interview with trump about a month ago. trump last appeared on cnn in late august. because anderson cooper challenged trump about the candidate's muddled stance on immigration, the post's callum borchers concluded that "it didn't go very well" for trump. "it went so not well, in fact, that you have to wonder whether his campaign will decide it's best to dodge the likes of anderson cooper and chuck todd — or, for that matter, chris wallace and bret baier — and stick to softball sessions with sean hannity and the 'fox & friends' crew," borchers wrote afterwards. trump's last time on nbc was the "commander in chief forum" on september 7. moderator matt lauer was widely criticized for his light touch with trump. related: behind the scenes, nbc execs concede matt lauer forum performance was "disaster" the candidate's last time on abc was a short interview with david muir on september 6. his last time on cbs was a "60 minutes" sit-down with lesley stahl on july 17. trump does have another cbs interview in the works, a campaign spokeswoman said. tv networks are agitating for more interviews with both trump and clinton. the difference between the two is that trump previously had a reputation for calling in to morning shows and sitting down with interviewers all the time. this accessibility also once extended to his traveling press corps. "trump used to be very, very accessible to the press. at the beginning of his campaign, he was extremely accessible," cnn politics reporter jeremy diamond said on sunday's "reliable sources." "you could catch him for quick interviews on the way in and out of rallies. and that has really changed." diamond said "he is less accessible i think, in many regards, than hillary clinton at this point." trump's campaign declined to comment monday on its media strategy. republican communications strategist ron bonjean said most candidates in trump's position would be "trying to reach a a broader general election audience." "however, most americans already know trump as a household name and he doesn't need to diversify his interviews for additional exposure," bonjean said. "trump is protecting himself from less friendly journalists while getting out his message at the same time even if it is to a more conservative audience." this conservative-focused media strategy is also gaining attention among trump's critics. "he pretty much exclusively appears on fox news now," judd legum, editor of the liberal news site thinkprogress, tweeted on monday. trump's relationship with hannity is perhaps the best symbol of how the candidate gets out his message on his own terms. trump has taped numerous town halls with the conservative commentator. according to tvnewser, wednesday's town hall will focus on "issues and concerns surrounding african-americans this election cycle." according to nielsen data, only 1.5% of hannity's 2 million nightly viewers are african american. overall, at any given time of day, about 2% of fox news viewers are african american.      donald trump retreats to friendly media ground      
__label__0 washington (cnn)donald trump's campaign on tuesday stood by a controversial tweet issued by the candidate's son, donald trump jr., in which he likened syrian refugees to a bowl of skittles. on monday, trump jr. tweeted a graphic that likened syrian refugees to skittles, which swiftly triggered a wave of criticism. "this image says it all. let's end the politically correct agenda that doesn't put america first. #trump2016," he tweeted, with a graphic that said: "if i had a bowl of skittles and i told you just three would kill you. would you take a handful? that's our syrian refugee problem." find out all you need to know for the 2016 election on "the daily dc" podcast the graphic had an official trump logo that the republican nominee shares with his running mate, mike pence. despite widespread condemnation, the campaign stood by the tweet and in a statement called trump jr. "a tremendous asset to the campaign." "america has become less safe under hillary clinton and barack obama, and clinton's planned 550% increase in syrian refugees is a dangerous proposal that will put american lives at risk," said senior communication adviser jason miller. "speaking the truth might upset those who would rather be politically correct than safe, but the american people want a change, and only donald trump will do what's needed to protect us." kellyanne conway, trump's campaign manager, also defended the comparison to cnn's erin burnett. "what we do know is that many americans are concerned with the lack of vetting that's going on. we see what's happening all across europe ... that has been a disaster," she said tuesday on "erin burnett outfront." but mars candy, which produces skittles, said in a statement, "skittles are candy. refugees are people. we don't feel it's an appropriate analogy. we respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing." 'this is disgusting' the graphic's language apparently wasn't a trump jr. original, but instead that of former illinois rep. joe walsh, a former tea party congressman from illinois and now a conservative talk radio host. walsh tweeted at trump jr.: "hey @donaldtrumpjr, that's the point i made last month. glad you agree." walsh's tweet included a screenshot of a tweet he made dated august 13. hillary clinton's campaign spokesman nick merrill retweeted trump jr. adding: "this is disgusting." the 2016 campaign has featured heated rhetoric around us policy for accepting refugees. clinton has called for an increase in the number of syrian refugees the us should accept and trump has called for "extreme vetting" of immigrants, as well as a ban on immigrants from countries that are hotbeds of terrorism, such as syria. one of president barack obama's former speechwriters responded to trump jr. with a link to cnn reporting about a little boy in aleppo, syria, who became the face of the humanitarian crises in syria. "hey @donaldjtrumpjr, this is one of the millions of children you compared to a poisoned skittle today," jon favreau tweeted. former obama campaign staffer, jason sparks, tweeted at trump jr. photos of the syrian refugee children in the crises and said: "these aren't skittles, @donaldjtrumpjr." musician john legend, who has been an outspoken critic of trump on twitter, wrote: "there's a tiny chance that anyone could be a murderer. get rid of everyone now!!! #trumplogic" legend also retweeted a photo of the aleppo boy, where someone said: "this is not a skittle." and former cia director james woolsey, a senior adviser to the trump campaign, told cnn's kate bolduan and john berman during "at this hour" that it was a "clumsy analogy" that "doesn't help" the trump campaign. "but he's not the one running for president," woolsey added. last week, trump jr. was criticized for making a "gas chamber" reference when complaining about how the treatment his father has received form the media compared to the coverage from clinton. "they've let her slide on every discrepancy, on every lie, on every dnc game trying to get bernie sanders out of the thing," he said. "i mean, if republicans were doing that, they'd be warming up the gas chamber right now. it's a very different system -- there's nothing fair about it." this story has been updated. correction: a previous version of this story wrongly identified the state joe walsh represented in congress and misattributed a quote to him. walsh is a former illinois congressman. it was joe wilson of south carolina who shouted "you lie" at president barack obama. cnn's jim acosta contributed to this report.      trump campaign defends son's skittles tweet

"the guy over the chicken stand brought litigation, a lot of litigation, against different people," trump told fox news' bill o'reilly in an interview set to air monday. "i'll bet you that's why he was on no list. he was on no list they probably didn't want to put him on because they didn't want to get sued. they probably saw he was a litigious guy and they don't want to get sued so they left him alone." rahami, who is suspected in saturday's bombings in new york city and seaside park, new jersey, was captured on monday after a manhunt and shootout. he is also believed to be connected to pipe bombs found sunday night in elizabeth, new jersey, sources told cnn. ahmad khan rahami: what we know about the bombing suspect rahami's family lives above first american fried chicken in elizabeth, according to the city's mayor, chris bollwage. his family has a history of clashing with the community over the restaurant, which used to be open 24 hours a day. additionally, in 2011 the rahami family alleged discrimination and harassment in a lawsuit filed against the city and its police department, arguing that officials conspired against them by subjecting them to citations for allegedly violating a city ordinance on hours of operation. trump added: "who knows what the reason is."

"the vote president bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days," mcgrath told cnn. "he is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim." townsend met with bush at the family compound in kennebunkport, maine, during a board meeting for the bipartisan points of light foundation. sources with knowledge of the conversation told cnn's jamie gangel they were surprised and disappointed that she had publicly shared a private conversation with the former president. find out all you need to know for the 2016 election on "the daily dc" podcast if george h.w. bush ultimately votes for clinton, he isn't likely to sway his entire family. marvin bush, the former president's youngest son, has said he would vote for libertarian gary johnson. george p. bush, george h.w. bush's grandson, has backed donald trump. and jeb bush, trump's former primary rival, has said he won't vote for trump or clinton.       george h.w. bush for hillary? a spokesman isn't saying      
__label__0 new york (cnn)hillary clinton and donald trump both met with world leaders in town for the united nations general assembly on monday, but the two presidential contenders did so with vastly different goals. both clinton and trump met with egyptian president abdel fattah el-sisi monday, as the grueling presidential contest enters its final weeks. the "jon stewart of egypt" takes on donald trump clinton, who served for four years as president barack obama's secretary of state, also met with japanese prime minister shinzo abe and ukrainian president petro poroshenko. while the stakes are high for both candidates, there is likely more on the line for trump who, as a foreign policy novice, is still looking to prove his chops before the first presidential debate next monday. trump used the meetings to try to convince voters that despite his often explosive personality he is qualified to serve as commander in chief. the key for the blunt businessman is the visuals of the meeting, hoping that voters see a president as they observe him with a world leader. "i will say that with all the folks being in new york, i've had a lot of calls from a lot of different people on the basis that i'm doing well and, you know, they seem to think it's important to maybe meet," trump said monday on fox news. "i don't want to comment specifically on who but a couple of people are coming over." he later said, "i've already met with a couple," but refused to say which ones. clinton used the meetings with the three world leaders, in contrast, to stress her facility with high-level diplomacy gained by years of experience on the world stage. her meetings are also certain to be watched in various parts of the world for signs of how she would direct us foreign policy as president. clinton addressed prickly topics with each world leader, according to aides in the room. clinton touched on north korea and the rise of china with japan's abe, while clinton addressing the need for a more vibrant -- and free -- civil society with egypt while she met with sisi. while reporters were in the room, clinton told sisi that she looked forward to talking about the "path we are taking in order to build up a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law, that respects human rights and liberties." trump also met with sisi on monday evening in new york where the two discussed "the strategic bilateral relationship between the us and egypt," according to a trump campaign statement after the meeting. sen. jeff sessions of alabama and lt. gen. michael flynn (ret.), two of trump's top foreign policy advisers, joined trump for the meeting. "mr. trump expressed to president el-sisi his strong support for egypt's war on terrorism, and how under a trump administration, the united states of america will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that egypt can count on in the days and years ahead," the trump campaign said. the republican nominee, who has faced widespread condemnation in the muslim world for his proposal to ban muslims from the u.s. and his blanket statements about islam, also shared his "high regard for peace-loving muslims," the campaign added. the campaign also said trump called the us-egypt relationship "vital to help promote peace and stability in the middle east." sisi is the second foreign leader trump has met with since becoming the republican nominee. he first met with the mexican president in mexico last month. sitting with poroshenko, clinton said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges ukraine faces, primarily "the very real problems and threats from russian aggression." clinton added that she was "anxious to know how we can be supportive of those efforts." clinton's meetings were announced before trump's, and a senior advisor to the former top diplomat said friday that they were less about furthering a political argument than preparing her to hit the ground running immediately if she wins the white house. "if she is elected, she wants to be sure she is prepared (not only) to handle the challenges but to seize the opportunities on day one," said a senior clinton advisor granted anonymity to talk about her foreign policy views. "while she has remained a candidate, she is also focused on what it would take to govern if she wins." the meetings also set up possible contrasts that could pose a challenge for trump given clinton's lengthy record on the international stage as both secretary of state and first lady. trump has tried to shore up his foreign policy credentials before, taking a trip last month to meet mexican president enrique peña nieto earlier this year. the meeting ended awkwardly after trump said they never talked about his proposed border wall, but peña nieto said he told trump during the meeting that mexico would not pay for it. clinton's campaign seized on the public back-and-forth between the mexican leader and trump, with the democratic nominee calling it trump's "embarrassing international incident." "when you see that he can't even go to a foreign country without getting into a public feud with the president, i think the answer is clear: donald trump does not have the temperament to be our commander in chief," clinton told voters in ohio after the meeting. for her part, clinton has decided to forgo the standard foreign tour as a candidate because her aides feel she doesn't need to burnish her foreign policy credentials. instead, she'll take the opportunity afforded in her home state to hobnob with foreign heavyweights -- and try to score political points. clinton's meeting with poroshenko, in the eyes of her aides, attempted to highlight the differences between the democratic and republican nominee on policy toward moscow. clinton's campaign and other democrats have accused trump of cozying up to putin, who has built his foreign policy on thwarting us goals and failing to confront moscow over its annexation of crimea in ukraine. clinton's adviser said that she believed that washington needed to do more to stand up to russian "aggression" in ukraine and to allow the kiev government to defend itself. currently, the obama administration has offered logistical help to ukraine's armed forces but has fallen short of lethal assistance as some republicans have championed. the official did not say, however, whether clinton would move toward lethal aid but said that she would take a look at any requests from the ukrainians. clinton's meeting with sisi will make waves in the middle east because of the recent estrangement between the egyptian president's government and the obama administration. clinton, according to an aide in the room, "emphasized the importance of respect for rule of law and human rights to egypt's future progress" and "discussed ways to deepen counterterrorism cooperation, particularly in the fight against isis." clinton also used the meeting to call for the release of us citizen aya hijazi, who has been imprisoned in egypt since 2014 after operating a non-profit in the country. clinton's adviser cautioned that the meeting on monday did not augur any kind of policy change towards egypt. but nevertheless, the official said, clinton does understand the complexity and complications of us relations with egypt, a nation that is pivotal to the balance of power in the middle east, is facing its own terror threats and would be critical to any renewed effort at israeli-palestinian peace. sisi assumed power following a coup against the elected muslim brotherhood government in egypt in 2013. clinton had been secretary of state when the us helped push egypt's longtime strongman hosni mubarak from power after a popular uprising, but was seen as less pro-active than other members of obama's cabinet in cutting loose a crucial, long-standing us ally. "there are a lot of things that the sisi government is doing that are concerning," the official said. trump's positions on foreign policy, among them on egypt, are more opaque than those of clinton. but in his terrorism speech in august, he vowed to work with leaders in the middle east -- including sisi -- who "recognize that this ideology of death" must be extinguished. clinton's meeting with abe comes at a time of increased tensions in asia following north korea's latest nuclear weapons test. the meeting will likely highlight clinton's commitment to us alliances in japan and south korea and the us belief that it is up to china to do more to convince its ally in pyongyang to turn away from its nuclear path. clinton, according to an aide, discussed "the threat from north korea" and "relations with china" during the meeting. and abe brought up the trans-pacific partnership, a massive 12-country trade deal that the japanese prime minister has backed and clinton has rejected. there is significant concern among us allies the region about the prospect of a trump presidency -- not least because the gop nominee has warned that both nations must pay more to keep us forces in their countries and raised the possibility that pyongyang's growing threat could force both states to develop their own nuclear weapons, a step neither nation wants to take. cnn's jeremy diamond and tom lobianco contributed to this report.      clinton, trump meet world leaders for very different reasons      
__label__0 (cnn)former president bill clinton sought to address concerns about his family's namesake foundation in an interview monday, admitting that while "it was natural" for donors to seek favors from the clintons, he'd "trusted" that the state department under hillary clinton would appropriately handle potential conflicts of interest. "it was natural for people who've been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. and i trusted the state department wouldn't do anything they shouldn't do," clinton told npr in an interview that aired monday morning. he also maintained that he would sever his connection to the clinton foundation if hillary clinton is elected president to remove any conflict-of-interest concerns, though he acknowledged the move would be "hard." "it is hard, but you know, if hillary is elected, i'm looking forward to it," clinton said. he noted that he's worked for the foundation "longer than i've ever had any job -- and i loved it." "and you know, we always say in response to our critics that nobody in my family ever took a penny out of this foundation and put millions of dollars in. but i would have paid more to do this job. it was the most fun thing i've ever done," clinton added. the former president pushed back on criticism that donors to the clintons foundation engaged in a "pay-to-play" scheme, whereby donations to the foundation bought influence with hillary clinton during her term as secretary of state. he pointed to the lack of evidence of any such quid-pro-quos, and accused critics of "smearing" him and his wife, according to npr. "in real life, if somebody tells a lie about you, and i find out it is, i like you more and them less. in political life, they just keep on smearing you -- even if it all comes to nothing -- people will like you less and won't hold anybody accountable for what they say." clinton also praised his wife for weathering criticism during her presidential campaign. "i wonder if there's a man in america that could have taken what she's been through in the last year and a half."       bill clinton: 'natural' for foundation donors to seek favors      
__label__0 new york (cnn)hillary clinton is visiting only two battleground states this week -- hardly a sign of confidence at her standing 49 days before the election, but an acknowledgement that one task reigns above all: preparing for her first face-to-face confrontation with donald trump. while she is set to make a quick trip to florida on wednesday, after dipping into pennsylvania on monday, clinton will devote the lion's share of her time huddling with her debate team, gaming out how she will confront trump next monday night at hofstra university. the lead clinton enjoyed for months in swing state and national polls has all but evaporated, raising the stakes for the first debate. the terrorism investigation in new york and new jersey has also added to the urgency of her first meeting with trump, which will touch on a litany of economic and security issues. find out all you need to know for the 2016 election on "the daily dc" podcast clinton, who has participated in more debates than any presidential candidate in recent history, faces a new challenge with trump. she is preparing for trump to confront her on a litany of uncomfortable subjects, ranging from her email scandal to bill clinton's infidelity to her health. trump showed he was willing to go there tuesday when he tweeted, "hillary clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. sleep well hillary - see you at the debate!" clinton, in a radio interview tuesday, said she was ready to deal with trump's attacks. "i am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as i can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and the bigotry that we have seen coming from my opponent," clinton said tuesday on the steve harvey radio show. "i can take it, steve. i can take that kind of stuff. i have been at this, i understand it is a contact sport." clinton, trump poised for historic debate battle to knock trump off his game, people advising clinton have been looking for a one-line retort that will be a memorable moment from the contest. clinton has spent hours watching a highlight reel of trump's republican primary debates, according to several people familiar with her debate preparation. she took notes on what agitated him, particularly in his exchanges with rival ted cruz, and studied his style. but democrats worry the first debate will give trump a chance to show a more moderate, controlled side, while millions of people watch, possibly for the first time. this, according to people who have recently talked with the former secretary of state, is not lost on clinton. clinton told supporters at an august fundraiser that a friend told her: "there will be about 100 million people watching and 60 million will be paying attention to the campaign for the first time. so don't assume they have followed anything." "there will be a lot of new impressions to be made that night," clinton said. a team of veteran advisers are leading her debate effort, including ron klain, who advised obama, and karen dunn, a long-time lawyer and aide. she is not setting up a formal "debate camp," aides said, but intends to be secluded at her home in chappaqua, new york, in the days leading up to the debate to prepare for her showdown on monday. clinton has also spent considerable time reading briefing books about trump's policy, personality and politics, including receiving input from tony schwartz, who was the co-author for "art of the deal," the best-seller about trump. expectations game clinton aides worry that they can't lower expectations enough ahead of the event. "for all his lack of substance, trump's showmanship, as ex-reality tv star, makes him a formidable debate foe. he thrashed his rivals in gop debates," brian fallon, clinton's national press secretary, tweeted in august. with her senate contests in 2000 and 2006, along with more than two dozen debates with barack obama in 2008 and nine meetings with bernie sanders in this primary campaign, she has stood on a debate stage more than 40 times. 2016 race tightens in florida trump will not be the first unconventional opponent clinton has faced in a debate. clinton all-but ended her 2000 senate race against rick lazio during one of their debates when she stood strong as the republican representative approached her lectern with a piece of paper and demanded she pledge to support stricter campaign finance rules. lazio's bizarre move was seen as bullying and rude and clinton handily beat him by 12 points in november. her debate last fall against four democratic primary opponents was seen as an outright win for the secretary of state because of the way she handled prickly questions, including about whether she is progressive enough for the current bent of the democratic party. "i'm a progressive. but i'm a progressive who likes to get things done," clinton said, rolling out a line she would later use repeatedly while campaigning. clinton's performances have not been without missteps, however. the former senator from new york cited the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks when asked about her ties to wall street, a response that aides later said came because their candidate was somewhat flustered by vermont sen. bernie sanders attacking her on the issue. which trump will show up? in the last few weeks, as clinton has publicly turned to a more affirmative message, the former secretary of state has started to focus on how to present her own policies and defend herself against attacks. clinton and her campaign aides have tried to keep a lid on leaks about clinton's debate process, preferring not to telegraph to the trump campaign how the former secretary of state will go after the businesses magnate. when asked about the debates, clinton has tried to laud trump's debating skill while admitting that it is for her to have a strong showing at hofstra. 8 unforgettable presidential debate blunders "i do not know which donald trump will show up," clinton said at an august fundraiser in new york. "maybe he will try to be presidential and try to convey a gravity that he hasn't done before or will he come in and try to insult and try to score some points."       hillary clinton prepares for unpredictable donald trump at debate      
__label__0 washington (cnn)republicans are preparing for the penalty phase of the 2016 election. the next republican civil war came into greater focus over the weekend when party chairman reince priebus threw a thinly veiled warning at former gop 2016ers who haven't yet endorsed donald trump: "get on board" or face penalties if you ever seek the presidency again. the nudge -- aimed at republicans such as john kasich, ted cruz and jeb bush -- was no off-the-cuff expression of frustration. several republican party chairs in early voting states told cnn that priebus has spent days talking about enforcing the pledge that all 17 gop candidates signed at the outset of the 2016 primary to support the eventual nominee. find out all you need to know for the 2016 election on "the daily dc" podcast "i can't tell you how many people have asked me, 'what are you going to do about these candidates that are not keeping their promise?'" iowa gop chairman jeff kaufmann told cnn monday. he said the iowa state gop receives 10 to 20 calls per week from rank-and-file republicans wondering what, specifically, the party will do to force kasich, cruz and bush to stick to their pledges and back trump. "if i'm hearing it here from a state of 3 million, it must a megaphone there in dc," said kaufmann, who has spoken with priebus and other republican officials about enforcing the pledge. "there's no wiggle room in terms of what that promise was, and it should be honored." a representative for priebus didn't comment on the conversations. but his call for penalties wasn't widely embraced -- with the no. 2 house republican breaking with priebus tuesday morning. "there's a better way to unite people. i'm not a big believer that punishment unites people," house majority leader kevin mccarthy told reporters at a weekly session in the capitol. the california republican added, "if hillary (clinton) can't unite republicans, i don't think anything can." premature conversation? of course, talk of penalties on candidates who might run in 2020 could be all for naught if trump wins. the race between trump and clinton has narrowed dramatically in recent weeks, though the democratic nominee still has more paths to the white house. but the episode underscores the frenzy that could consume the gop if trump loses the race and the party searches for a new direction. the anatomy of a white, working-class trump voter "we're watching the trailer for the gop civil war, out in theaters november 9," said a top republican strategist, who asked not to be named to avoid openly feuding with priebus. the penalty talk spilled into the open sunday, when priebus told john dickerson on cbs' "face the nation" that members of the 2016 republican presidential field who haven't yet abided by their pledge to back the eventual nominee and endorsed trump need to "get on board." and for those who don't, he said future presidential bids won't "be that easy." "if a private entity puts forward a process and has agreement with the participants in that process, and those participants don't follow through with the promises that they made in that process," priebus said, "what should a private party do about that if those same people come around in four or eight years?" kasich's camp quickly zipped off a response accusing priebus of putting party over principles. kasich strategist john weaver said the ohio governor "will not be bullied by a kenosha political operative that is unable to stand up for core principles or beliefs." cruz brushed priebus off tuesday evening. "these are serious times. i think the last thing we need to worrying about is bickering between republicans," he said. "my focus is on defeating hillary clinton and helping preserve a senate republican majority." the rnc's leverage penalties, several republicans said, would likely come from the national party in the form of restrictions on access to the republican national committee's data and voter files -- and potentially bans from primary debates. individual states, though, likely couldn't keep candidates off their ballots. still, republicans cautioned that talk of penalizing pledge-breakers is aimed at nudging kasich, cruz, bush and others to support trump in 2016 -- not to handicap the party's presidential candidates in the future. some said it's not even clear the rnc would have authority to impose the crackdown priebus discussed. "reince has simply posed a question to which there is no good answer yet -- and i'm not sure that the question deserves an answer. that's to be determined," said matt moore, the south carolina gop chairman. rnc spokeswoman lindsay walters declined to address the possibility of penalizing future presidential candidates who didn't abide by their pledges to support trump. "we are focused on winning back the white house and maintaining our majorities in the house and senate," walters said in an email. donald trump opens the personal insult vault (again) while some party honchos like kaufmann backed priebus' warning shot, others -- including ohio gop chairman matt borges -- bristled. "no. this is not what we are all about as a party. besides, let's stay focused on 2016 for the next 50 days," borges tweeted sunday night. top mitt romney 2012 strategist stuart stevens tweeted: "so idea is most popular recent republican governors of battleground states should run as independents? great plan." rnc's handling of trump the rnc's handling of trump under priebus will be on trial as the party picks a new chair -- or extends the wisconsin operative's tenure -- shortly after the election. then comes a swing-state governor's race in virginia, followed by the midterm elections, where trump's brand of populism could butt against more orthodox conservatives. and in 2020, the early stages of the republican primary would be defined by how the candidates treated trump. it would be the clearest differentiator of like-minded conservatives like mike pence, the indiana governor who became trump's running mate and chief defender, and cruz, the texas senator who was booed off stage for refusing to endorse trump at his own nominating convention. "assuming trump loses, there'll be a really pitched battle for the heart and soul of the party," said weaver, the kasich strategist who wrote the scathing rebuttal to priebus on sunday. "you're going to have off-year elections, you're going to have midterms -- some of that will impact the defining of the party, clearly. but you won't have any new definition of it until there's a new nominee," weaver said. "there's a broader debate ultimately about what the party stands for and where the country should go." adelson to spend at least $45 million on 2016 races in boost for gop many republicans still fault priebus for failing to criticize trump forcefully enough in late 2015, when he proposed a clearly unconstitutional ban of all muslims from entering the united states, and believe the party could have done more to slow trump's rise. they point out a particular irony: the party that insisted it couldn't intercede in the 2016 nominating contest is now threatening to use its leverage to undercut individual candidates in future races. saul anuzis, a former michigan gop chairman who helmed cruz's state effort in the primary, defended pledge-breaking candidates, arguing that "circumstances change" -- a reference to the pledge's creation as a tool to keep trump from launching an independent campaign. he said he doesn't see how priebus could impose penalties on future presidential candidates. "there's no provisions in the rnc rules that allow anybody to punish anybody," anuzis said. "the idea of doing that, i think, is extremely difficult, because you normally are looking toward the future, not the past." cnn's deirdre walsh and manu raju contributed to this report.      the gop's next civil war is brewing

"he can't fake his way through 90 minutes," chen, a research fellow hoover institution and a cnn contributor, told cnn's party people podcast hosts kevin madden and mary katherine ham. trump participated in debates throughout the republican presidential primary schedule, emerging largely unscathed in the polls after fighting off more than a dozen gop presidential primary opponents, and locking up the party's nomination by may. clinton prepares for unpredictable trump at debate chen, a republican policy wonk who worked for former massachusetts gov. mitt romney and florida sen. marco rubio on their respective presidential campaigns, said the general election debates present a different challenge -- in part because he'll have just one other opponent and an increased focus on substance. "the 90-minute general election format makes it a lot harder to one line your way through it," chen said, adding, "i think it's going to be very, very hard for donald trump to spend 90 minutes bumper-stickering. i think he's got to have something." chen said clinton faces her own challenges in the general election debates -- the first of which is on monday at hofstra university in hempstead, new york. "i think for hillary clinton the challenge is: how does she expose the deficiencies in what he said or proposed without sounding pedantic?" chen said. "she's going to sound like the teacher that nobody likes. and nobody wants to hear the teacher they don't like lecturing them for 90 minutes." chen, whose background is in developing conservative policy ideas, said that if trump wins the presidency then the real estate mogul would likely outsource setting his policy agenda to his running mate mike pence or house speaker paul ryan. "either way, paul ryan plays a big role," chen said.

__label__0 washington (cnn)the battle over gun rights returned to the nation's capital tuesday, as a federal appeals court took up a challenge to a restriction that requires applicants for a license to carry a concealed firearm to demonstrate a "good reason" to fear injury to his or her person or property. "this is the most important question in the second amendment today," said adam winkler of ucla school of law. "whether people can carry guns in public and under what conditions is a major battleground." lawyers for district of columbia called the license restriction an "important public safety law" and argued before a panel of the us district court for the district of columbia that the law should be allowed to remain in effect pending appeal. "this case is in its infancy," said holly m. johnson, an assistant attorney general for the district. but challengers asked the court to block it, arguing that "very few people" will be able to demonstrate that they are eligible for the permit. the three judges hearing the challenge were all nominated by republican presidents. judge thomas griffith, a george w. bush nominee, asked by far the most questions on the bench. he noted there is a "long history" of courts sustaining bans on concealed carry, but, joined by judge stephen williams, a ronald reagan appointee, he repeatedly questioned the scope of the dc permit requirement. more than once he asked about someone who lived in a dangerous neighborhood but had never been attacked who might not qualify for the permit. griffith asked whether someone had to be "attacked first." griffith noted that only a handful of other states have similar laws. the third judge, karen henderson, a george h. w. bush nominee, did not ask a question. one of biggest cases since heller eight years ago, it was another washington gun ordinance that triggered a landmark supreme court opinion -- district of columbia v. heller -- that held for the first time that the second amendment protects an individual's right to bear arms. the opinion capped off a decades-long debate on whether the right applied only in connection to service in a state militia. back in 2008, the law at issue concerned a total ban on handguns in the home. tuesday's case deals with weapons outside the home. gun rights advocates thought that heller -- penned by the late justice antonin scalia -- would encourage courts to strike down restrictions across the country. that didn't happen. instead, many courts relied upon a different part of scalia's opinion where he cautioned that the second amendment should not be understood as conferring a "right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose." meanwhile, the supreme court has declined to take up any follow-up cases. how scalia will be replaced has become a major issue in the presidential race. donald trump has pledged to appoint conservative justices in the mold of scalia. trump's gop primary rival, ted cruz, consistently name-checked the heller decision. hillary clinton has advocated for stronger gun control laws. meanwhile, president barack obama's nominee for the bench, judge merrick garland, waits on the sidelines. the dc law at issue in tuesday's case is based on similar provisions in new york, maryland and new jersey. several plaintiffs are challenging the law, including matthew grace, who says he was denied a permit in 2016 because he had failed to show a "good or proper reason" to support his request for a license. he owns four lawfully registered handguns and seeks to carry them outside the home for self-defense. grace's case and a similar one brought by different plaintiffs split two different district court judges reviewing the law. the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia will hear both appeals on tuesday. "the district of columbia has spent the last four decades trying to drain the second amendment of any meaning," charles cooper, a lawyer representing grace and other plaintiffs, argued in court papers. cooper objects to the fact that dc officials have given themselves the power to decide "on a case-by-case basis" whether an applicant has "good reason" to obtain a license to carry a concealed gun. he says that such a power is "categorically irreconcilable" with the second amendment. "nearly a decade after heller, the district of columbia still refuses to treat the right to bear arms as a genuine constitutional right," he said. in their briefs, lawyers for the district of columbia point out that washington is "unique" in that it is filled with thousands of high ranking federal officials, and diplomats and it hosts hundreds of heavily attended events annually including political marches and protests. citing supreme court precedent, they argue that the "second amendment preserves the ability of local jurisdictions to devise solutions to social problems that suit local needs and values, and that is precisely what the council has done through the 'good reason' standard." dc is supported by lawyers for the brady center to prevent gun violence, who emphasize that from 2014 to 2015, the homicide rate in the district increased 54%. "the district may meet or surpass that tragic record in 2016," jonathan lowy, an attorney for the brady center, argued in briefs. he pointed out that in one dc area -- ward 7 -- homicides have tripled so far this year. "it is critical that law enforcement maintain its longstanding authority to prevent the rampant carrying of guns in public places," lowy said in an interview. "it would be an extraordinary and radical shift for a court to find that law enforcement has no authority to reasonably regulate the carrying of hidden handguns in public." but the national rifle association counters that while dc officials are "rightly concerned about violent crime," the "constitution affords them considerable discretion in addressing the problem. " "the second amendment's protection of the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms' necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table." nra's lawyer paul clement argued in court briefs. "municipal leaders, no matter how well-intentioned, cannot simply enact any gun control law that they deem to be reasonable."       gun rights debate returns to washington courtroom      
__label__0 (cnn)florida -- a perennial swing state -- is living up to its reputation ahead of the november election. a cnn/orc poll last week found hillary clinton and donald trump almost evenly matched. the survey among likely voters gave trump 47% to clinton's 44% -- with a 3.5% margin of error -- wiping out clinton's bump following the democratic convention in august. with 50 days until the election, florida political experts say it's anyone's guess who will come out on top in the sunshine state. "so if i had to call it today, it would simply be, flip a coin," says usf tampa political scientist susan macmanus, a distinguished professor at the university of south florida. "we're to the point where anything is possible. this is just one of those kind of elections." all eyes are on central florida's i-4 corridor, historically responsible for swinging elections in either direction. the area stretching from tampa to daytona beach is diverse in politics, age, racial make-up and social economics. the two florida's are apparent by traveling just 60 miles. george h.w. bush for hillary? a spokesman isn't saying the villages, a master planned senior community centered on manicured golf courses, is staunchly republican and full of largely white retirees. it's a must-stop for any gop state, federal or presidential campaign. trump's running mate, gov. mike pence, visited the community over the weekend. he opened his rally asking, "how many republicans in the villages?" followed by a huge roar from a packed ballroom at the conference and activity center. an hour south is orlando, a city with a democratic mayor since 2003. it is booming with diversity, including puerto ricans on the east side, african-americans on west side and vietnamese, hipsters, whites and an lgbt community in the middle. gop policy guru: trump can't 'fake his way through 90 minutes' in downtown orlando on saturday, a latin festival filled the air with salsa music and the aroma of puerto rican food. it took place on the same grounds of the dr. philips center, where thousands turned out to remember 49 people slaughtered at the pulse nightclub in june. sandra calixto, a hillary clinton supporter who attended the festival, believes trump is racist. "the main thing is he has discriminated against people with a disability and i have a son with disability," she said. "and for me, he is coo coo." trump jr. likens syrian refugees to skittles clinton is outspending donald trump on tv ads in the state by a 4-to-1 margin. clinton spent $38.7 million to trump's $9.2 million throughout the general election. in the past week alone clinton bought over $5 million in ads -- trump spent under $1 million, a clear difference in campaign strategy. the campaigns are also taking different courses in setting up offices across the state. clinton has 57 offices and over 90,000 volunteers, according to a democratic national committee memo. trump has relied heavily on state republican field offices instead of setting up his own. between the rnc and trump, 60 offices are open with 210 paid staff and thousands of volunteers according to trump's florida director susan wiles. "i am one of those that doesn't think that brick and mortar matter that much," says wiles. "there are plenty of places for volunteers to gather."       2016 race tightens in florida      
__label__0 united nations (cnn)president barack obama took to the most prominent international stage tuesday to deliver a stark warning to american voters of the dire global consequences they face should they embrace isolationism and ultra-nationalism in november. never mentioning republican presidential nominee donald trump by name, the president's final address to the united nations general assembly was at heart an impassioned rebuke of the gop candidate's policies on trade, immigration and multiculturalism -- and a defense of liberalism and tolerance -- delivered 49 days before votes are cast for his replacement. he painted a dark picture of the future awaiting americans, and the world, if the forces of "aggressive nationalism" or "crude populism" win out. and he specifically inveighed against building a wall -- a centerpiece of trump's proposal on border security. "a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself," obama declared to the assembled representatives of the un's member states. gone were obama's idealistic appeals to bring about a world free of nuclear weapons and an agenda focused on peace, as were his previous un addresses. the "hope and change" of his argument as a presidential candidate himself was also replaced by exhortations against a future filled with chaos. "time and again human beings have believed they finally arrived at a period of enlightenment, only to repeat cycles of conflict and suffering. perhaps that's our fate," obama suggested. "we have to remember the choices of individual human beings led to repeated world war," obama said. "each of us as leaders, each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best. for we have shown that we can choose a better history." he pointed to growing divisions and discontent at home that challenge those decisions, and noted that the shortcomings of globalization had created "an uncertainty and unease and strife" that required acknowledgement, but not turning inward. "i believe that at this moment we all face a choice," obama said. "we can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration or we can retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion. i want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not back." it was obama's eighth and final address to the un body, which enthusiastically welcomed him in 2009 after he moved to reverse the unilateral approach of his predecessor george w. bush. in his speech that year, obama vowed to work within international bodies to confront the world's crises while pushing an agenda combating climate change and nuclear non-proliferation. but in the intervening years, the harsh realities of diplomacy settled in, both for obama and the un. the organization's inability to stem suffering in syria and ukraine laid bare the continued struggles to combat breaches of international law, while obama's own work toward combating violent extremists has failed to stop terrorist groups from committing atrocities. obama's address tuesday reflected those realities. he drew titters from the collection of world leaders and diplomats in the high-ceilinged general assembly hall when he noted that "at times both america's adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems were either caused by washington or could be solved by washington. and perhaps too many in washington believe that, as well." he made scant mention of individual world flash points, choosing instead to offer a more thematic recap of his foreign agenda. "the world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before. and yet our societies are filled with uncertainty and unease and strife," obama said. "despite enormous progress, as people lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult and tensions between nations become more quick to surface." related: clinton, trump meet world leaders for very different reasons obama continued his tradition at the un of acknowledging areas where the us has fallen short in its practice of democracy, saying his country and other developed nations must set a better example for emerging democracies. citing the pervasive role of money in politics, entrenched party allegiances and a patchwork of voting laws, obama said it was up to long-established nations to show the way forward. "those of us who believe in democracy, we need to speak out forcefully. because both the facts and history is on our side," obama said. "we better strive harder to set a better example at home." obama used his own efforts to help revive a stalled economy as an example of us leadership during his tenure, saying other countries would be wise to follow his lead of going after corruption and unfair tax policies. he also cited the deal with iran to curtain its nuclear program, and reopening of ties with cuba and myanmar, as examples of a successful global approach. related: global leaders at un tackle world's worst to-do list but the array of places where obama's approach hasn't yielded the outcomes he projected during his first appearance here in 2009 were also unavoidable. that includes his inability to negotiate peace between israel and the palestinians -- a major topic in his first four un addresses that was entirely absent during last year's speech. this year, the president took issue with both sides' actions toward one another. he criticized israeli settlements, saying the only path to mideast peace will come when the two sides reconcile deeply held differences. palestinians must "reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of israel," obama said. but he also said peace won't come until "israel recognizes it cannot permanently occupy and settle palestinian land." obama plans to meet israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on wednesday to "discuss the need for genuine advancement of a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict in the face of deeply troubling trends on the ground," according to white house press secretary josh earnest. another persisting crisis -- russia's continued incursion into ukraine -- also drew obama's attention tuesday. "in a world that left the age of empire behind, we see russia attempting to recover lost glory through force," obama said. "if russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it may be popular at home. it may fuel nationalist fervor for a time. over time, it's also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure." indeed, many of his harshest warnings were aimed at global government practices that damage democracy and liberalism and called for the rejection of strongmen, authoritarian and tribalism. "there appears to be growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now," he told the assembled leaders. "and i want everybody to understand, i am not neutral in that contest."       obama at un warns americans against walls and nationalism

__label__0 washington (cnn)the national rifle association is returning to the defense of donald trump in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign, a reminder of how fervently the gun-rights group has backed the republican nominee on television. the nra is launching a $5 million tv ad campaign tuesday, the group says, meant to turn out pro-second amendment voters at a time when trump is being attacked for his language about firearms. the gun lobby has aired $7.7 million in television time on trump's behalf, support that makes it the second-most active pro-trump advertiser in the general election. but it had not been on the airwaves since late last month. the nra's political victory fund is tasked with spending half the money on five swing states -- ohio, nevada, virginia, north carolina and pennsylvania -- while its institute for legislative action, its lobbying arm, is spending the second-half on national cable. all of the money is going to a harrowing ad that shows what the nra says would happen if hillary clinton appoints her chosen justices to the supreme court. "she'll call 9-1-1. average response time? 11 minutes," says the narrator as a sleeping woman is startled by nighttime footsteps. the woman runs to a nearby safe to grab her weapon, but it's empty. "don't let hillary leave you protected with nothing but a phone." the advertisements targets rural voters in battleground states who might be democrats or disillusioned republicans, according to jennifer baker, an nra spokeswoman. "it is designed to run up the score with those trump voters," she said. the nra's chief political adviser chris cox said the ad "underscores" how clinton's position on guns creates "one set of rules for her, and a different set of rules for the rest of us." trump has emerged as a proud spokesman for gun rights, though he has at times invited controversy. on multiple occasions, trump has been attacked for encouraging gun-owners to incite violence against clinton, though trump's campaign has said he is being misinterpreted. "i think her bodyguards should drop all weapons. disarm immediately," trump said in miami last week.

"just like his tax plan, donald trump's maternity leave and childcare plan is designed to benefit the wealthy, while leaving hard-working women and families behind," pelosi, a democrat, said in a statement. "unsurprisingly, lgbt families, fathers and adoptive parents have no place in trump's pinched notion of hard-working america." the meeting in washington comes a day after trump's daughter met with house speaker paul ryan, at her request, during the speaker's visit to new york. related: clinton's challenge: rebuilding obama's winning coalition the recent focus on this set of issues by the gop nominee comes as polls show the race tightening, but trump trailing hillary clinton among female voters in recent national and battleground state polls. the new proposals from donald trump reduce the costs for families by making child care expenses tax deductible for families making less than $500,000. trump also proposed setting up tax-free accounts to be used for child care and child enrichment activities. he also proposed providing paid maternity leave by extending unemployment insurance benefits to those working mothers whose employers do not offer paid maternity leave.       ivanka trump to huddle with female republican members of congress in washington      
__label__0 (cnn)rapper yg really wants you to know he doesn't like donald trump. while other hip-hop artists like rick ross, jeezy and ti have publicly dissed the republican presidential nominee, none have gotten as much traction as yg, and arguably, none have been as singularly focused. check out: #getpolitical — a cnnpolitics originial series in the lead-up to his second studio album, "still brazy," the california rapper dropped a single called "fdt," a song whose title is made up of the gop nominee's initials and an expletive. as the track opens, yg says, "me and all my peoples, we always thought he was straight, influential motherf---er when it came to the business. but now, since we know how you really feel, this is how we feel. f--- donald trump." then he launches into his anthem, cursing the real estate mogul's name dozens of times. it was something of a new area for the west coast rapper. the songs off his first album, like "bicken back being bool" or "who do you love," were largely apolitical, even if they did veer into socially conscious territory once in a while. by his own admission, yg is "not political." he told cnn in a wide-ranging interview about his music over the summer his concerns over issues like trump's anti-mexican rhetoric and his dismissal of police brutality and the black lives matter movement led him to speak out. "he can't be counted on to handle these issues. this issue is important to the black community, period. it's life," yg said. "this s--- is bigger than hip- hop. ... we're supposed to use our platform to speak up and bring our brothers together and put some light on some of this s--- that's not right for our people." yg also called out other rappers for not speaking out against what he considers a "racist" campaign. he said they were putting their personal interests and fear of backlash over their beliefs. "they're scared on what comes with it, what could come with it," yg said, adding, "they're not doing business with trump. ... they're saying they ain't political. they ain't going to get into all this s---... i'm not political either bro, but guess what? all that s--- matters." yg said that fear of backlash is not unfounded, and added that he has faced repercussions over his song. he told tmz in april that the us secret service reached out to his record label after he dropped "fdt." "if i talk about him on my album, they're gonna try to take it off the shelf," yg told tmz. secret service spokeswoman nicole mainor declined to verify or deny those claims, telling cnn, "the secret service does not discuss protective investigations." what hip hop lyrics tell us about donald trump potential secret service warnings aside, the compton rapper hasn't let up. in may 2016, he released a video where he read the lyrics to "fdt" from behind a podium, offering the lines as a point-by-point rebuttal to a trump speech. just before the republican national convention, yg released "fdt part 2," a remix featuring unlikely yg collaborators macklemore and g-eazy. on his verse to close out the song, yg nods to the two white rappers joining him and says of trump, "your own kind don't even like you." "i'm on tour with two of the biggest white rappers in the game right now," yg said. "(the) fan base a little different than mine. so i'm touching a lot of new people that i ain't never touched before. so it's a good thing. that's what it's about." but yg did not leave it at that either. in mid-august, he announced a nationwide "f--- donald trump" tour, giving the song a final whirl before election day. then in mid-september he released a skit teasing his tour, where an actor playing trump says "what do they got to lose," recalling the republican nominee's outreach to african americans. what hip hop lyrics tell us about hillary clinton the rapper has not decided whether he will vote in november and said that his opposition to trump is not a show of support for democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton.

__label__0 (cnn)hillary clinton's campaign manager said wednesday that the democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in charlotte, north carolina and tulsa, oklahoma. "there are two prongs to her approach," robby mook, hillary for america campaign manager told cnn's alisyn camerota on "new day." "the first is to have a set of national standards around how to manage the situations that doesn't exist right now and that could help through training to prevent situations like this." related: charlotte police shoot and kill man, sparking growing protest "there are no set of national best practices on how to manage situations," he continued. "these situations are handled by local policies currently. and what she is proposing is that we actually set up national standards so that localities have better policies to work with and train towards." clinton spoke out tuesday against "systematic racism" following the recent shooting of terence crutcher in tulsa, oklahoma. crutcher was shot and killed last week after his car broke down. the 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before officer betty shelby fatally shot him. crutcher was unarmed at the time. the charlotte-mecklenburg police department said wednesday that "approximately 12 officers" were injured during protests after the fatal shooting of keith lamont scott tuesday by a police officer. mook said the other part of clinton's plans involves working to improve the relationship between police and minorities. "the second piece is to restore bonds between communities and law enforcement, so investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the resources in the community to prevent something like this from happening," he said. clinton told radio host steve harvey on tuesday's "the steve harvey morning show" that she plans to speak "directly to white people" about implicit bias. mook said wednesday clinton meant she would explain that different ethnic groups are often treated differently in america. "what she's saying is our entire country needs to do some real soul-searching here. it is clear that the criminal justice system is not treating everybody the same way," he said. "if you are african-american or from a minority group, you may not be being treated the same as a white person. and that's a problem." related: yg seizes mantle of rap's most outspoken donald trump critic clinton said tuesday that while there are "good, honorable, cool-headed police officers" working across the country, "we can do better."

"and it needs to be intolerable." clinton later tweeted on the shooting, writing, "another unarmed black man was shot in a police incident. this should be intolerable. we have so much work to do. #terencecrutcher -h." related: road to 270 in response to the crutcher shooting, both the department of justice and state authorities have launched investigations into the officer-involved shooting. danny c. williams, us attorney of the northern district of oklahoma, said prosecutors will attempt to determine whether a federal civil rights violation had occurred. authorities refused to immediately answer additional questions due to the ongoing investigation. cnn's max blau and jason morris contributed to this report.      clinton plans to develop national standards to manage police shootings      
__label__0 washington (cnn)senate minority leader harry reid offered an explanation tuesday for why donald trump won't disclose his tax returns: the republican presidential nominee is "faking his net worth." the nevada democrat -- and frequent trump foe -- levied the charge on twitter, evoking a similar claim he made against the gop's 2012 nominee, mitt romney. "trump is faking his net worth. he's not as rich as he would have us believe + a bad businessman. that's why we can't see his tax returns," reid tweeted. reid, citing an unnamed source, memorably accused romney during the 2012 race of going 10 years without paying federal income taxes. romney released a 20-year summary of his tax liabilities from 1990 through 2009, and his tax returns from 2010 and 2011. but he did not release additional returns. the trump campaign did not return cnn's request for comment. reid on tuesday then went to the senate floor to rip into trump. "the last thing the american people want or need is a president who will run another financial scam on each of them," the nevada democrat said. "if elected, donald trump would be the scammer in chief. trump is a fraud." "he's always looking for a mark, some victim for one of his schemes," reid added. "and now our country is trump's next target. he wants this to be his biggest payoff ever." reid's speech focused what he sees as lies about trump's money and said the real estate mogul is only wealthy because he was born with "a silver spoon." trump's father was a wealthy real estate magnate who loaned his son money to jumpstart his career. "litigation is nothing new to donald trump. over the last decade and a half, trump and his companies and have been sued in federal court 72 times. that doesn't take into consideration the many times he's been sued in state courts," reid said. "but trump being the flim-flammer he is just moves on to another scam." reid, who is supporting hillary clinton, has repeatedly attacked trump this campaign. following clinton's pneumonia diagnosis earlier this month, reid attacked trump's health. "take a look at this character that's running for president. he complains about her health. what does he do? he's 70 years old. he's not slim and trim. he brags about eating fast food every day. look at his health a little bit," reid said last week. and on thursday, reid tore into trump on the senate floor, calling the republican presidential nominee a "spoiled brat," "a con artist" and a "human leech who will bleed the country."       harry reid: donald trump 'faking his net worth'      
__label__0 washington (cnn)the national rifle association is returning to the defense of donald trump in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign, a reminder of how fervently the gun-rights group has backed the republican nominee on television. the nra is launching a $5 million tv ad campaign tuesday, the group says, meant to turn out pro-second amendment voters at a time when trump is being attacked for his language about firearms. the gun lobby has aired $7.7 million in television time on trump's behalf, support that makes it the second-most active pro-trump advertiser in the general election. but it had not been on the airwaves since late last month. the nra's political victory fund is tasked with spending half the money on five swing states -- ohio, nevada, virginia, north carolina and pennsylvania -- while its institute for legislative action, its lobbying arm, is spending the second-half on national cable. all of the money is going to a harrowing ad that shows what the nra says would happen if hillary clinton appoints her chosen justices to the supreme court. "she'll call 9-1-1. average response time? 11 minutes," says the narrator as a sleeping woman is startled by nighttime footsteps. the woman runs to a nearby safe to grab her weapon, but it's empty. "don't let hillary leave you protected with nothing but a phone." the advertisements targets rural voters in battleground states who might be democrats or disillusioned republicans, according to jennifer baker, an nra spokeswoman. "it is designed to run up the score with those trump voters," she said. the nra's chief political adviser chris cox said the ad "underscores" how clinton's position on guns creates "one set of rules for her, and a different set of rules for the rest of us." trump has emerged as a proud spokesman for gun rights, though he has at times invited controversy. on multiple occasions, trump has been attacked for encouraging gun-owners to incite violence against clinton, though trump's campaign has said he is being misinterpreted. "i think her bodyguards should drop all weapons. disarm immediately," trump said in miami last week.

__label__0 washington (cnn)donald trump and hillary clinton are deadlocked in north carolina, according to a new poll released tuesday. the poll from elon university found trump leading clinton by 1 point among likely voters, 44% to 43%, a statistical tie, within the 3.86-point margin of error. libertarian gary johnson drew 6% support, while another 6% said they were undecided. clinton and trump maintain large advantages in north carolina with key constituencies -- clinton receives the support of 98% of black voters, while trump is backed by 65% of white voters. the gender divide is less severe, however, as clinton leads trump among women by 6 points while trump's advantage among men is 10 points. majorities said that both trump and clinton were worse than typical republican and democrat candidates for president, though more were likely to describe clinton than trump as "about the same as usual." the elon poll also surveyed likely voters on their perceptions of the candidates' health -- a major focus in the presidential race after clinton was diagnosed with a case of pneumonia two weeks ago. seventy-seven percent of north carolina voters said they think trump is healthy enough to be president, but only 56% said the same about clinton. opinions were sharply divided along partisan lines. additionally, just under half said that both clinton and trump had not provided enough medical information. with fewer than 50 days remaining in the race, 6% of north carolina likely voters said they remain undecided, according to the poll. but when asked if they had to choose between clinton, trump and johnson, 35% chose clinton, compared to 18% for trump and johnson each. when johnson voters were asked to choose between clinton and trump, slightly more said they prefer trump, though nearly 4 in 10 continued to indicate no preference. north carolina likely voters were also asked if they thought russian president vladimir putin or president barack obama was a better leader, likely prompted by trump's recent comments that putin has been "far more" of a leader than obama. overall, 60% chose obama, while 23% said putin -- but a plurality (39%) of republicans chose putin, with about a quarter saying they "don't know." the elon university poll of north carolina surveyed 644 likely voters, with a margin of error of +/- 3.86 points. it was conducted from september 12-16.       poll: trump and clinton deadlocked in north carolina      
__label__0 washington (cnn)did he really say that again? and again?  at a florida rally monday night, donald trump twice repeated the false claim that he opposed the iraq war before it started. "i was against going into the war in iraq, he told the crowd, "but we got out the wrong way. president obama did a terrible thing the way he got us out of the war."  but cnn's research shows no evidence for his repeated claim of opposition to the war before it started. instead, during a september 2002 interview on howard stern's radio show trump was asked if he supported invading iraq. "yeah, i guess so," he answered. hardly a ringing endorsement of the upcoming war. but nowhere near full-throated opposition.  in an august speech, trump pointed to an interview with fox news channel anchor neil cavuto, three months before the war started, to bolster his case that he opposed the war. at one point in the interview, he expressed impatience with president george w. bush for not starting the war.  "well, i'm starting to think that people are much more focused now on the economy," he said. "they are getting a little bit tired of hearing, we're going in, we're not going in, the -- you know, whatever happened to the days of the douglas macarthur. he would go and attack. he wouldn't talk. we have to -- you know, it's sort like either do it or don't do it."  later in the interview, trump said the war was not a higher priority than the economy. but he never said it should not be undertaken. "he's under a lot of pressure," trump said of bush. "i think he's doing a very good job. but, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. i think the iraq situation is a problem. and i think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned."  it wasn't until august 2004 -- 17 months after the invasion began and the war was being widely criticized -- that trump came out fully against the war. "what was the purpose of this whole thing? hundreds and hundreds of young people killed," he said in an interview with esquire magazine. "and what about the people coming back with no arms and legs? not to mention the other side. all those iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. and it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. all this for nothing!"  this gap between what trump claims and the evidence to the contrary has been pointed out many times. yet he keeps repeating the claims. given that, it is hard to come to any other conclusion than that he is simply lying.        reality check: trump repeats lie that he was against the iraq war from the start      
__label__0 washington (cnn)donald trump's campaign manager sought to downplay concerns raised by a report tuesday that the republican nominee's personal philanthropy used more than $250,000 to litigate lawsuits against opponents of his business interests. kellyanne conway said she's not worried about the washington post report that said on four occasions the donald j. trump foundation cut checks to settle suits in a controversial and potentially illegal tactic, given that the foundation is funded primarily with other donors' money, not his own, according to the post review of legal documents and interviews. "trump is using his charities to benefit his businesses, which is against the law," washington post reporter david fahrenthold told cnn's john berman and kate bolduan of his report. the most substantial donation was $100,000 to fisher house, a veterans' charity, as part of a settlement with the city of palm beach, florida, home to trump's mar-a-lago club. conway defended the donation as a settlement because of a flag trump wanted to raise at the mar-a-lago. "i think this is a classic donald trump," she told cnn's erin burnett on "outfront." "he wanted to raise the american flag as high as he possibly could over mar-a-lago. i think a lot of americans at this point would applaud that. and of course the county said he couldn't do that, it had to be smaller, so they started assessing a $1,250 fine. so the way they wanted to settle it was for trump to donate $100,000 to a veteran's group." and another check for $158,000 was distributed from the foundation as a way for a trump golf course to settle another lawsuit, according to the post. "i've been talking to the people who are responsible for the trump foundation to get some facts and some figures," she said. "it's very important for people to understand what happened in these cases. donations went to veterans groups ... how did the mar-a-lago benefit from him giving $100,000 to veterans? the veterans benefited and i think that's great and i applaud him for doing that." burnett said: "well, the business benefited by the lawsuit going away and being settled, right? that would be how the business benefited." "well, there are many lawsuits everyday against people ... i think you're making things up based on facts as they are not reported in this story, which also uses a lot of conditional phrasing, i'd like to point out," conway said. conway also added that trump frequently is "signing checks privately to help people" from his own bank account separate from the foundation, "you can only imagine how many people have asked mr. trump for his time and his resources and his connections and his money privately, and he does that and he doesn't have cameras in there, it doesn't go through foundations," she said. burnett pointed that the public could verify those donations if trump released his tax returns, to which conway didn't directly respond. trump's foundation has come under scrutiny from investigators and democrats over possible pay-for-play schemes. new york attorney general eric schneiderman is investigating the foundation to make sure it is abiding by state charity law, and house democrats have called for the department of justice to look at trump's relationship with florida attorney general pam bondi, who declined to formally investigate it.       trump aide dismisses concerns over report he used family charity to settle lawsuits against his businesses      
__label__0 white plains, new york (cnn)hillary clinton's supporters in the beehive state have launched utah mormons for hillary, according to a release from the campaign, the latest attempt to court a group of people deeply skeptical of donald trump. clinton's campaign has sought to draw a wedge between mormons -- a religious group that makes up about 60% of utah, according to some estimates -- and trump, the republican presidential nominee. some mormon voters have grown concerned by trump's candidacy, citing questions they have about his principles and comments he has made that hint at religious persecution. the goal, according to david irvine, a former republican member of the utah house of representatives and a member of the the organization, is to convince people within the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints to pick clinton over trump by touting the former secretary of state's values and commitment to religious liberty. since its founding in 1830, mormons have been persecuted and chased out of a number of areas they tried to settle. members of the faith, after being expelled from ohio, illinois and missouri, eventually settled in utah in 1847. irvine said in a statement that trump is "belittling and scapegoating people of other religious and ethnic minorities in the harshest language." "his disdain for them is equaled only by his disdain and crudity toward women," irvine said. "the most enduring pioneer value is charity in its broadest sense, and utahns looking for those kinds of values" should vote for clinton. last month, clinton pitched mormon voters in an op-ed published by the deseret news, a paper owned by the church. clinton nods to the church's history of persecution in her op-ed, noting that other mormons have compared trump's comments to "when missouri gov. lilburn boggs singled out mormons in his infamous extermination order of 1838" and "president rutherford b. hayes' attempt to limit mormon immigration to america in 1879." shortly after the piece came out, jake sullivan, clinton's top policy adviser, opened a campaign headquarters in salt late city. clinton is not the only presidential candidate looking to undermine trump in utah. evan mcmullin, a former house republican aide and a mormon born in provo, utah, announced his plan to get on the ballot in utah earlier this year, hoping to court members of the church away from trump. mcmullin's campaign stresses that he is plugged into the mormon church's power structure, and in a close race in utah, a strong mcmullin showing could help put the state's six electoral college votes into clinton's column. clinton's aides know that chances of winning utah are long, but her outreach is more about forcing trump to spend time and money to shore up support in a state that hasn't voted for a democrat since lyndon johnson in 1964.       clinton supporters look to drive wedge between utah mormons, trump

__label__0 (cnn)it is incredibly difficult to overstate donald trump's influence on the 2016 presidential race. unless, of course, you are donald trump. the billionaire building mogul and reality tv-star-turned-republican nominee has a showman's talent for claiming attention -- and credit for just about anything he wants. for decades now, trump has made an art of celebrating his lead role, real or imagined, in a laundry list of business and entertainment ventures. his entry into the political world has done little to curtail the habit. here are a handful of trump's most outlandish claims: that he pioneered the 'airplane rallies' politicians have used for decades for decades, barnstorming candidates have parked planes, headlined rallies, then flown off to their next stop on the hustings. trump, too, is fond of pulling up a podium in front of his "trump force one" 757 jet and speaking to supporters at airfields and in hangars. clinton did something similar on monday, holding a brief news conference in front her own plane. a day later, trump pounced. "do people notice hillary is copying my airplane rallies(?)" he asked in a tweet on tuesday morning. "she puts the plane behind her like i have been doing from the beginning." but was clinton really "copying" trump? mitt romney, george w. bush, john kerry and john mccain (among so many others) might disagree. even ronald reagan used his plane as a prop. in fact, candidates have been using their vehicles of choice (or necessity) as backdrops for campaign rallies for more than 100 years. in 19th and early 20th centuries, though, that usually meant a train and a "whistlestop" rally. that he 'finished' birtherism in 2011 trump took credit last week for having "finished" the conspiracy theory he nurtured and promoted for so long. after falsely accusing clinton of having "started the birther controversy," trump said: "i finished it. i finished it. you know what i mean. president barack obama was born in the united states -- period." the basis for the claim? another dubious assertion, from 2011, when president barack obama released his long form birth certificate in an effort to stamp out any remaining sliver of doubt about his birthplace. "i am really honored frankly to have played such a big role in hopefully, hopefully, getting rid of this issue," trump told reporters then, effectively claiming credit for the president's decision. "we have to look at (the birth certificate), we have to see is it real, is it proper, what's on it, but i hope it checks out beautifully. i am really proud, i am really honored." he would spend the next five years perpetuating the smear. that he brought the republican convention to ohio the timeline tells the story. july 8, 2014: the republican national committee awards cleveland the party's 2016 convention. june 16, 2015: donald trump enters the republican presidential primary. june 18, 2016: trump tells fox news, "i wanted (the convention) to be in ohio. i recommended ohio." "i wanted it to be here," trump told fox's bill o'reilly in an interview as the convention got underway. "and we had lots of choices. i wanted it to be in ohio. i recommended ohio." factcheck.org looked into the claim and found "no evidence" to support it. that he got hillary clinton to say 'radical islamism' after months of being hammered by a variety of republicans for being too politically correct, hillary clinton in june uttered the words "radical islamism" in an interview on cnn's "new day." but the context is relevant: clinton was responding to a question about the criticism and explaining why she does not use the term regularly or in stump speeches. "whether you call it radical jihadism, radical islamism, i think they mean the same thing," she said. "i am happy to say either. but what i won't do, because i think it is dangerous for our efforts to defeat this threat, is to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion. that plays right into isis' hands." undeterred, trump tweeted his delight -- and took credit for what he described as clinton's capitulation. "i have been hitting obama and crooked hillary hard on not using the term radical islamic terror. hillary just broke-said she would now use!," he wrote. that he was being congratulated for 'being right on radical islam' after the orlando attack giving new meaning to the term "congrats twitter," trump on the morning after the deadliest mass shooting in u.s. history tweeted his thanks for "being right" about the threat of domestic terror. "appreciate the congrats for being right on radical islamic terrorism, i don't want congrats, i want toughness & vigilance," he wrote. "we must be smart!" trump never specified the source of those congrats and the comment was met with considerable and colorful -- see the responses to the tweet -- online backlash. that he broke 'the glass ceiling' for women on the same night clinton, who in her 2008 primary concession speech famously lamented that "we weren't able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling," became the first woman in american history to claim the title of presumptive major-party presidential nominee, trump told fox news not to discount his own appeal to female voters. after all, he reminded host bill o'reilly, "i was the one that really broke the glass ceiling on behalf of women more than anybody in the construction industry." trump has been credited -- by others -- for his hiring practices, but he's also been criticized for a litany of ugly public statements about women in all fields. that he inspired budweiser to rebrand its beer as america' on may 10, reports first surfaced that budweiser would temporarily rename its signature product. instead of simply budweiser, the beer will for the next few months be called "america." the next morning, trump was asked by "fox and friends" co-host steve doocy if he thought his campaign "had something to do with" the decision. "i think so," trump replied. "[budweiser is] so impressed with what our country will become that they decided to do this before the fact." that he forced ford's years-old decision to shift some truck production to ohio in october 2015, trump declared that "even my harshest critics gave me credit" for ford's decision to "build a massive plant in the united states." he also cited his "constant badgering" as the impetus for the automaker's scrapped plans for a new one in mexico. one small problem: the claims were false, according to ford. "we decided to move the f-650 and f-750 medium-duty trucks to ohio assembly in 2011, long before any candidates announced their intention to run for u.s. president," ford said in response. the construction of a $2.5 billion engine and transmission plant in mexico is slated to go ahead as planned, the company confirmed. that he aided in the release of americans in a prisoner swap with iran when the u.s. and iran agreed to a prisoner swap in january that brought home, among others, washington post journalist jason rezaian, officials said the agreement came after more than a year of tightly-held negotiations "accelerated" by parallel nuclear talks. trump had other ideas. "so i've been hitting them hard and i think i might have had something to do with it," he said at the south carolina tea party convention. "you want to know the truth? it's a part of my staple thing, i mean, i go crazy when i hear about this, you go absolutely wild because how is it possible?" that he caused planned federal raids on undocumented immigrants in response to the washington post's december 2015 report that the obama administration had signed off on a federal effort to track down and deport undocumented families who had entered the country over the past year, trump pounced. "wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ice to launch large scale deportation raids," he tweeted. "it's about time!" in another tweet, sent less than 24 hours later on christmas day, trump again credited himself for the decision: "does everyone see that the democrats and president obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. politics!" that he had a role in majority leader kevin mccarthy's decision to withdraw his bid for house speaker in october, house majority leader kevin mccarthy abandoned his bid to move up a slot and replace john boehner as speaker. the california congressman's campaign had been hampered by conservative holdouts in the gop's tea party wing and effectively buried by mccarthy himself when had admitted in an interview that a house benghazi probe was a vehicle for blunting hillary clinton's presidential ambitions. enter trump, who at a campaign rally in las vegas offered a slightly different narrative. "they're giving me a lot of credit for that because i said you really need someone very, very, tough and very smart," he said. "you know, smart goes with tough. i know tough people that aren't smart. that's the worst. we need smart, we need tough, we need the whole package. that he alone drove viewers to the first gop debate the first republican primary debate, held on aug. 6 in cleveland, drew 24 million viewers, a record-breaking figure that a fox news spokeswoman said made it the highest rated telecast the network's nearly two-decade history. trump took notice. at a rally a few weeks later, he touted the total, adding "they normally have like 2 million people" watching. (note: the first primary debate four years earlier had 3.2 million.) "i won't take credit for it," trump told supporters in iowa, "but believe me, 100 percent it's me. a hundred percent. it's true. it's true!" that he denied jeb bush the gop nomination jeb bush entered the republican primary race as the odds-on favorite to follow in his father and brother's footsteps. he exited, on feb. 20, a defeated man -- or, as trump explained to the new york times, a man defeated by donald trump. "i think jeb would have been the nominee had i not gotten in," he said, "but i was able to define jeb early." indeed, bush never seemed to come have an answer for trump's unrelenting, mocking attacks. that he won the 2012 gop primary in nevada for mitt romney how exactly did mitt romney win the nevada caucuses back in 2012? donald trump has an idea. in the aftermath of the eventual nominee's victory, trump, who endorsed romney days earlier, chalked up the result... to trump. "there was a lot riding on that particular race in nevada and it was interesting, because the numbers were much, much greater than you thought," trump said during a chat with "fox and friends." "and a lot of people are giving me credit for that. and i will accept that credit. always accept credit." that he made lady gaga a star in his 2011 book, "time to get tough: make america great again!," trump took a bow for helping to launch the pop star's soaring celebrity. "i really believe i had at least something to do with it," he wrote. "she became a big star and maybe she became a star because i put her on the miss universe pageant. it's very possible, who knows what would have happened without it, because she caused a sensation."       trump did not make lady gaga — and other things he can't take credit for      
__label__0 chappaqua, new york (cnn)hillary clinton's economic speech on wednesday in orlando will focus on how the united states can create an economy that values people with disabilities, an attempt to contrast the former secretary of state with republican nominee donald trump. clinton, an aide said tuesday, will propose an economy that "welcomes people with disabilities, values their work, rewards them fairly, and treats them with respect." wednesday's speech is clinton's fourth in a series of addresses where the former first lady is attempting to talk more about her values and proposals and less about trump. clinton has so far given "stronger together" speeches on faith, community service and children and families. while those speeches have focused more on clinton, they have not been devoid of trump contrast. in all three speeches, clinton has tried to keep her talk of trump to a minimum, but they have cast him as an ill-prepared candidate who should not be president. and wednesday's speech will be no different. many low-wage workers not protected by minimum wage clinton's campaign and democrats view trump's attacks on new york times reporter serge kovaleski, whose arthrogryposis impairs the movements in her arm, as their most effective character attack against the republican nominee. trump mocked kovaleski during a campaign event in south carolina last year after the reporter questioned trump for citing his story as proof that "thousands" of muslims celebrating in jersey city, nj, as the world trade center towers burned and fell during the 9/11 terror attack. clinton turned trump's comments into her first general election campaign ad.  by talking about what she would do for people with disabilities, clinton is offering voters an implicit contrast with trump. clinton will outline a series of policy proposals for people with disabilities on wednesday, according to the aide, including eliminating sub-minimum wages for people with disabilities and proposing "new partnerships with businesses to improve hiring practices for those living with a disability." after the speech wednesday, the aide said, clinton will be "the only candidate with a plan for an economy that includes more people with disabilities."       clinton economy speech to focus on valuing people with disabilities      
__label__0 (cnn)former president george h.w. bush said monday that he will vote for hillary clinton in november, according to sources close to the 41st president -- an extraordinary rebuke of his own party's nominee. the sources said this was not the first time bush had disclosed his intention to vote for clinton. the comments came during a receiving line for board members of the bipartisan points of light foundation when bush was speaking to kathleen hartington kennedy townsend, robert f. kennedy's daughter and the former maryland lieutenant governor. there were roughly 40 people in the room, and it's not clear how many people heard him, though multiple sources did. the republican former president's embrace of the democratic nominee represents a dramatic new chapter in the complicated three-decade-old relationship between the two most prominent families in american politics. it's a stunning political move -- one that comes just 49 days from the election, and less than a week before clinton and donald trump square off in their first debate. trump's campaign manager, kellyanne conway, told cnn's erin burnett tuesday that she respects "the 92-year-old former president very much and his decision." "it is ironic that he would vote for the wife of the man who knocked him out of the race," she added on "erin burnett outfront." "but look, this was a bruising primary ... so i know there are a lot of hurt feelings there." news of his support for clinton came first on facebook, when kennedy townsend posted a photo of herself with george h.w. bush, along with the caption: "the president told me he's voting for hillary!!" kennedy townsend sits on the advisory board of the points of light foundation. bush family representatives declined to respond publicly. "the vote president bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days. he is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim," bush spokesman jim mcgrath said in a statement. but sources with knowledge of the conversation told cnn they were surprised and disappointed that kennedy townsend had publicly shared a private conversation with the former president. kennedy townsend declined to comment through a spokesman at the rock creek group, where she works as managing director. she later took down the facebook post. gop's trump divide trump's controversial candidacy has split the group of former republican nominees. mitt romney has hammered trump in speeches and on twitter, calling him unfit for office. but former kansas sen. bob dole has endorsed trump, as has arizona sen. john mccain -- though somewhat reluctantly, often referring to "the republican nominee" rather than trump by name. neither george h.w. bush nor george w. bush had weighed in on the general election -- even as trump savaged george w. bush's decision to go to war in iraq. however, many of the 41st and 43rd presidents' cabinet secretaries and national security officials have backed clinton. george h.w. bush national security adviser brent scowcroft endorsed clinton in june, saying she "has the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time." george w. bush commerce secretary carlos gutierrez said on cnn in august that he "would have preferred jeb bush, but i think hillary is a great choice. i am afraid of what donald trump would do to this country." and louis wade sullivan, the health and human services secretary under george h.w. bush and the only african-american in his cabinet, said this month that "though my enthusiasm for hillary clinton is somewhat tempered, i certainly believe she is an infinitely better choice for president than donald trump." but george h.w. bush isn't speaking for his entire family. marvin bush, the former president's youngest son, has said he would vote for libertarian gary johnson. george p. bush, george h.w. bush's grandson, has backed trump. and jeb bush, trump's former primary rival, has said he won't vote for trump or clinton. a representative for george w. bush wouldn't comment on kennedy townsend's facebook post or how george h.w. bush would vote. the representative simply said george w. bush is "spending his time working to keep the senate in republican hands and is not commenting on the presidential campaign." the bush-clinton relationship the evolving relationship between the bush and clinton families began in 1992, when bill clinton ran against -- and defeated -- incumbent president george h.w. bush. eight years later, with clinton term-limited out of office, bush's son, then-texas gov. george w. bush, succeeded clinton on a pledge to "restore honor and dignity" to the white house -- a not-so-subtle knock on clinton's marital infidelity. but bill clinton and george h.w. bush have also spent their post-presidencies teaming up for philanthropic endeavors. and in recent years, bill clinton and george w. bush have increasingly appeared together. the two grew so close that george w. bush has referred to clinton as his "brother from another mother," and clinton has said the two bonded over becoming grandfathers. a bush-clinton matchup early in the 2016 campaign cycle, it appeared the two families could be headed for another showdown with the presidency on the line: hillary clinton was seeking the democratic nomination, while former florida gov. jeb bush -- the 41st president's son and the 43rd president's brother -- was a republican candidate and a fundraising powerhouse. even if george h.w. bush hadn't endorsed hillary clinton, it was hard to envision him backing trump. neither of the former bush presidents attended the republican national convention in cleveland, where trump became the gop's nominee -- with the bush family staying out of presidential politics after jeb bush, denounced repeatedly by trump as "low-energy," exited the race. clarification: this story has been updated to clarify the context in which george h.w. bush made his comment about voting for hillary clinton. cnn's daniella diaz contributed to this report.      sources: bush 41 says he will vote for clinton      
__label__0 washington (cnn)the united states has reached the preliminary conclusion that russian warplanes bombed an aid convoy and warehouse belonging to the syrian arab red crescent, two us officials told cnn. "all the evidence we have points to that conclusion," one of the officials said. the white house position is that russia is responsible, whether it was russian planes -- or the syrian regime's -- that carried out monday night's attack. the aid convoy was hit in the area of urum al-kubra, west of aleppo, prompting the united nations to halt its aid operations in syria. it is not clear who was responsible for the strike, which the international committee of the red cross said killed about 20 people as well as the director of the red crescent's urum al-kubra branch, omar barakat. "all of our information indicates clearly that this was an airstrike. that means there only could have been two entities responsible," deputy national security adviser ben rhodes said tuesday night, referring to russia and syria. he didn't specify which country's planes carried out the strike. "we hold the russian government responsible for airstrikes in this airspace given their commitment under the cessation of hostilities was to ground air operations where humanitarian assistance was flowing," rhodes said, referring to the terms of a recent ceasefire brokered between the united states and russia. is there any hope left for syria? denials from russia, syria russia denies it was responsible and says that terrorists carried out the attack. defense ministry spokesman igor konashenkov said tuesday that analysis of video footage from drones of the strike show that militants were following the convoy, according to the russian state news site tass. "it is clearly seen in the video that a terrorists' pickup truck with a towed large-caliber mortar is moving along with the convoy," he said. syria has also strongly its forces were behind the attack. un outrage un secretary general ban ki-moon called the attack "sickening, savage and apparently deliberate." "just when we think it cannot get any worse, the power of depravity sinks lower," ban told world leaders convening tuesday at the un general assembly annual meeting. eighteen of the convoy's 31 trucks were hit, the united nations said. the convoy was due to deliver food and medical aid for some 78,000 people in eastern aleppo, where an estimated 250,000 civilians are facing severe shortages as a result of a government siege. current intelligence rebels, locked in a vicious civil war with the syrian government, reportedly hold the area where the convoy was struck. russia has been helping syrian president bashar al-assad in the fight, though it has said its efforts are focused on attacking terror groups such as isis that have flourished during the conflict. the us military has been reviewing classified radar, signals and aerial surveillance intelligence. based on that intelligence and reports from the ground, it has concluded that only russian warplanes were in a position to attack this location at the time, the official said. un chief calls convoy attackers in syria 'cowards' for now, no intelligence indicates syrian aircraft or helicopters were in the area, though that type of information could come to light later, the official said. the official added that reports from the ground appear accurate about at least two waves of airstrikes -- a common russian military practice. trucks inside as well as outside the compound on the road were hit. but the obama administration has not yet fully decided how much information it wants to reveal, concerned that it will expose sensitive military intelligence capabilities to the russians. what about the the ceasefire? monday night's attack came just hours after syrian authorities declared an end to the fragile ceasefire, which began september 12. soon afterward, syrian warplanes resumed airstrikes in aleppo, according to the syrian observatory for human rights, and deadly violence returned across parts of the country. the events have left the hard-fought ceasefire brokered by russia and the us in tatters, although us officials said they believe the ceasefire agreement is still in place. rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, said the us preference is to continue with the ceasefire effort, paving the way for more cooperation between the russian and us militaries in syria, but that moscow's actions could prevent further coordination. "we have not seen good faith. this was an outrageous action," rhodes told cnn's michelle kosinski. "it raises serious questions about whether or not this agreement moves forward." he added, "in conflicts like this i think we have an obligation to continue to pursue whether there are diplomatic openings. if we can't, we walk away." us secretary of state john kerry said before the convoy was struck monday that any decisions about the ceasefire would be made between washington and moscow. "the syrians didn't make the deal," he said, "the russians made the agreement." cnn's elise labott, tim hume, joshua berlinger and kevin liptak contributed to this report.      us blames russia for syria convoy attack; moscow points to terrorists      
__label__0 washington (cnn)the top republican on the senate's homeland security committee wants the department of homeland security to hand over its records on the suspects in this weekend's bombings in new york and new jersey and an unrelated stabbing in minnesota. sen. ron johnson of wisconsin sent a letter tuesday to dhs secretary jeh johnson asking for information on dahir adan, alleged to have stabbed 10 people in a mall in st. cloud, minnesota, and ahmad khan rahami, alleged to have planted improvised explosive devices in new york and new jersey. johnson also asked for information about rahami's wife, asia bibi rahami, a pakistani national who has not been accused of any wrongdoing. father says he warned fbi the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee chairman asked the secretary for the alien files, records of foreign travel, visa applications and citizen applications for the two men and immigration, visa and travel records for rahami's wife. "it is important for congress to learn more about these individuals in order to understand and evaluate the department's efforts to counter homegrown radical extremism," johnson wrote. the senator told cnn's wolf blitzer on tuesday that the request for information is about putting pieces together. "i've sent a letter to secretary of dhs jeh johnson. i want to see the alien file, i want to know everything we can found out about mr. rahami as well as mr. adan," johnson said. "and we've just got to try to piece things together. but wolf, we are not fighting a winning battle here when we're dealing with these inspired lone wolfs." rahami is a naturalized citizen who came to the states from afghanistan. he traveled at length to afghanistan and pakistan. adan was somali and was killed by an off-duty police officer during the attack.       senator asks dhs for information about ny, minnesota suspects

__label__0 washington (cnn)massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren tore into republican presidential nominee donald trump on the campaign trail saturday for lying about president barack obama's citizenship and hinting at violence against his democratic opponent, hillary clinton. speaking to clinton supporters at ohio state university, warren continued her ongoing feud with trump by criticizing his admission friday -- after five years of falsehoods -- that obama was born in the us. "only when his handlers tied him down and forced him did he grudgingly admit that the man was born in the united states," warren said. "what kind of a man does that? a man with a dark and ugly soul." later friday, trump, at a campaign event in miami, cited clinton's push for greater gun control to suggest the democrat's secret service detail should disarm. "let's see what happens to her," trump said. "take their guns away, ok? it'll be very dangerous." that was the second time in as many months when he appeared to urge violence against clinton. in august, trump appeared to suggest that "second amendment people" could do something about clinton if she became president and nominated judges who favored gun restrictions. the trump campaign later said he only meant to increase political engagement, not incite violence. warren disagreed. "trump has repeatedly invited his supporters to commit a horrific act of violence against his opponent, against another human being," warren said. "what kind of a man does that? a bully. a twisted bully who can't fight his own fights." warren has been an attack dog of sorts for clinton ever since she clinched the democratic nomination, and the real estate mogul has hit back. trump goes so far as to refer to warren as "pocahontas," a reference to her claims of native american heritage. warren was but one of many clinton surrogates hitting the trail in support of her this week. sen. bernie sanders, who, like warren, appeals to younger and more liberal voters, made two appearances in ohio on saturday.       warren: trump has 'dark and ugly soul'      
__label__0 miami (cnn)a manufactured storyline. a promise of a "major statement." and an ulterior motive. donald trump on friday pulled off his latest media stunt, scoring more than 20 minutes of free live tv time to tout the endorsement of more than a dozen veterans and to talk up his new hotel in washington after he and his campaign had promised he would address his longstanding, controversial "birther" position. then, he made a 67-word statement stating that he now believes president barack obama was born in the us, and quickly abandoned the podium -- leaving reporters bellowing questions into the ether. none of us were surprised. after all, friday's circus was nothing short of standard operating procedure for the real estate mogul and his media-bashing campaign -- and just the latest example of how trump fueled his political rise through his unparalleled mastery of the media. but this time, there weren't just a few shouted questions from reporters. instead, trump stepped away from the mic amid a cacophony of cheering supporters -- more than 100 of whom separated trump from the press -- and reporters, some standing on chairs, shouting dozens of questions at the top of our lungs. "when did you change your mind about obama being born in the us?" i shouted. "what took you so long to make this decision?" shouted another reporter. "why won't you answer our questions?" and then, he's gone. trump had just changed a signature position he's held for years with a few dozen words and no explanation of why he had suddenly changed his mind. and he also notched 51 days since his last news conference. the moment was emblematic of trump's treatment of the press throughout the campaign -- particularly in the last 24 hours. reporters covering this campaign -- as i have for the last 15 months -- have long grown used to trump lobbing insults our way, shouts of "scum," "dishonest" and "disgusting" reverberating as thousands of his supporters, many of them snickering at the spectacle, turn toward the press pen, booing. some of us have even come to expect a call from the would-be-president every so often to hear the candidate gripe about a particular article and shame us as "dishonest." but on thursday night, trump took his mistreatment of the press to new lows, taking the stage at a rally in new hampshire moments before the traveling press corps' plane touched down in the state, and proceeding to mock us. "i have really good news for you. i just heard that the press is stuck on their airplane. they can't get there. i love it," trump said, to his supporters' glee. we arrived for the last three minutes of his speech -- a circumstance caused by trump's refusal to travel on the same plane as reporters covering his campaign, defying decades of precedent in the coverage of democratic and republican nominees. trump boasts about dumping traveling press corps the event on friday was his coup-de-grace. having promised a "major statement," via twitter, trump talked up his hotel -- "under budget and ahead of schedule" -- and invited a parade of military veterans to come to the podium and tell the world why they were supporting trump's presidential bid. the event was no longer about a republican presidential nominee reversing his position on an issue supported by a fringe slice of america. it was about brave military men embracing this controversial figure, flaws and all. all the while, the cameras continued to roll, the remarks carried live on cable news in anticipation that trump would clarify his position on birtherism as he had promised that morning. it's the kind of free, unfiltered media coverage that every politician dreams of, but few will ever grasp. finally, after 28 minutes, trump lifted the suspense and got to the point. he falsely claimed that his opponent hillary clinton "started the birther controversy" in 2008 and stated, matter-of-factly, that "president barack obama was born in the united states" -- something obama proved beyond a shadow of a doubt in 2011 when he released his long-form birth certificate. he spent more time talking about his hotel than explaining how he was changing his position on the issue that skyrocketed him to national political prominence and earned him his earliest notes of support from the far-right. trump laid his media trap the night before when his campaign put out a statement hours after a washington post interview published in which trump declined to disavow his birther views. the interview took place a day earlier, but the campaign waited another day, until 12 hours before the event in washington, to blast out a statement. it remains to be seen whether trump's move helped him. cnn and fox news cut away at points in the presentation. networks spent the day talking about trump's history as a birther. the trump campaign had also previously billed a march campaign event as a possible news conference, only for the candidate to not take any questions. the event, which had been scheduled earlier, came just days after his campaign manager was accused of grabbing a reporter. before friday, the campaign's most recent deception came wednesday when campaign advisers told reporters that trump would not be releasing results of his latest medical exam on the "dr. oz" program. and then trump did just that, with a reality show-style surprise. as we filed into the event hall for his rally friday night, we were still nowhere closer to understanding why trump had suddenly flip-flopped on birtherism. the campaign had ignored all our requests for comment. we hadn't had an opportunity to prod trump on the when and why of his sudden change of heart, especially when he had declined to disavow the position just days earlier. but as we awaited the familiar sound of lee greenwood's "god bless the usa," a more ominous tune played instead. it was a song from broadway's "les misérables," the words "les deplorables" flashing on the screen above the stage, harkening to clinton's comment about his supporters from earlier this month. i flicked at my iphone, and powered on the video recorder. but moments later, trump wondered aloud what would happen if clinton's secret service detail were disarmed. and that was the news.       donald trump's surreal friday, from press row      
__label__0 (cnn)president barack obama on sunday suggested sexism in society could be hurting hillary clinton's white house bid. "there's a reason why we haven't had a woman president; that we as a society still grapple with what it means to see powerful women," obama said at a dnc fundraiser in new york city. "and it still troubles us in a lot of ways, unfairly, and that expresses itself in all sorts of ways." obama used his short speech at the event to praise clinton while simultaneously ripping into republican nominee donald trump. "it's an infomercial. it's a reality show," obama said of the manhattan businessman. "this guy is not qualified to be president." the remarks from obama come just one day after he made an impassioned plea to african-american voters at the congressional black caucus gala in washington, d.c., urging them to work to stop trump. he said it would be a "personal insult" to his legacy if black voters did not turn out on election day for hillary clinton. the fundraiser was held at the home of audrey and danny meyer, who is the ceo of union square hospitality group in new york city. about 65 attendees were in the room and contributed $25,000. the co-chairs contributed $100,000, while the chairs raised or contributed $250,000. cnn's allison malloy contributed to this report.      obama suggests sexism could be hurting clinton's white house bid      
__label__0 (cnn)jeb(!) bush is back. the former republican presidential candidate had a cameo in the emmys opening sequence sunday night, appearing as a limo driver who's "in between jobs right now." in the sketch, host jimmy kimmel hitched various rides from celebrities to the emmys, before running into the motorcade for julia louis dreyfus' character in "veep." she flatly refused to let him in her limo, but a voice from the driver's seat told the comedian there was plenty of room up front. kimmel opened up the passenger seat door only to find the former florida governor in a full-blown limo-driver suit, hat included. "you know you can make $12 an hour driving for uber?" bush asks. (bush was a big uber fan who frequently praised the company in his stump speech.) when kimmel told him he was going to the emmy's and that he was nominated, bush offered a self-deprecating line. "wow, what's that like?" he then gave kimmel some advice on his emmy candidacy. "if you run a positive campaign, the voters ultimately will make the right choice, jimmy," bush said, alluding to his unsuccessful primary fights with donald trump, the republican nominee. but when kimmel began to reflect on the comment, bush shut it down.

__label__0 as the presidential campaign enters its home stretch, cnn's steve holmes will be scrutinizing political claims that ignore the facts with a reality check. (cnn)it was early sunday morning when many americans were having their breakfasts that new jersey gov. chris christie appeared on cnn's "state of the union" with jake tapper -- serving up two whoppers. the issue was how long donald trump continued to ask whether president barack obama was born in the united states even after obama produced his long-form birth certificate birth certificate in 2011. that document showed obama was born in hawaii. in the interview, christie stretched the truth beyond recognition two times within 30 seconds, a kind of double salchow of prevarication. first, his assertion that the so-called birther issue was first raised by the clinton campaign. "it was a contentious issue," christie told tapper, "and, by the way, an issue that patti solis doyle of the clinton campaign in 2008 has recently admitted that it was an issue that mrs. clinton also injected into her campaign in 2008 in a very quiet, but direct way against then-sen. obama." really? solis doyle said that? actually, here's what she said to cnn's wolf blitzer. "the campaign, nor hillary, did not start the birther movement. period. end of the story. there was a volunteer coordinator, i believe in late 2007, i think in december. one of our volunteer coordinators in one of the counties in iowa, i don't recall whether they were an actual a paid staffer, but they did forward an email that promoted the conspiracy." "the birther conspiracy?" blitzer asked. "yeah. hillary made the decision immediately to let that person go. we let that person go, and it was so, you know, beyond the pale, wolf, and you know, so not worthy the kind of campaign that certainly hillary wanted to run or that we as a staff wanted to run that i called david plouffe, who was obviously managing barack obama's campaign in '07, to apologize and basically say this is not coming from us." funny, solis doyle's admission sure sounds an awful lot like a denial and there is no evidence that then-sen. clinton interjected this into her campaign in any way. shortly thereafter, christie took issue with tapper for saying that trump stayed on the birther issue for five years after obama released his long-form birth certificate in april 2011. "it's just not true that he kept it up for five years," christie said to tapper. "it's simply not true. it wasn't like he was talking about it on a regular basis until then, and when the issue was raised he made very clear the other day what his position is." here is what cnn reported on what trump said and did after the long-form birth certificate was released: -- "he didn't know he was running for president, so he told the truth. the literary agent wrote down what he said ... he said he was born in kenya and raised in indonesia ... now they're saying it was a mistake. just like his kenyan grandmother said he was born in kenya, and she pointed down the road to the hospital, and after people started screaming at her, she said, 'oh, i mean hawaii.' give me a break." may 24, 2012, interview with the daily beast's lloyd grove, responding to an erroneous report about obama -- "a lot of people do not think it was an authentic certificate. ... many people do not think it was authentic. his mother was not in the hospital. there are many other things that came out. and frankly if you would report it accurately i think you'd probably get better ratings than you're getting." may 29, 2012, to cnn's wolf blitzer -- an 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @barackobama's birth certificate is a fraud. follow donald j. trump ✔ @realdonaldtrump 4:23 pm - 6 aug 2012 9,792 9,792 retweets 6,844 6,844 likes -- a tweet more than a year after obama released his long-form birth certificate. -- "was it a birth certificate? you tell me. some people say that was not his birth certificate. maybe it was, maybe it wasn't. i'm saying i don't know. nobody knows." august 2013 to abc news - "how amazing, the state health director who verified copies of obama's 'birth certificate' died in plane crash today. all others lived." follow donald j. trump ✔ @realdonaldtrump 4:32 pm - 12 dec 2013 5,796 5,796 retweets 3,709 3,709 likes -- in a tweet about the death of loretta fuddy. -- "well, i don't know -- did he do it? ... well, a lot of people don't agree with you and a lot of people feel it wasn't a proper certificate." may 2014, in an interview with tv3's colette fitzpatrick in ireland, trump first contested whether obama had released his birth certificate, then questioned its legitimacy. -- "there are three things that could happen. and one of them did happen. he was perhaps born in kenya. very simple, ok? he was perhaps born in this country. but said he was born in kenya because if you say you were born in kenya, you got aid and you got into colleges. people were doing that. so perhaps he was born in this country, and that has a very big chance. or, you know, who knows?" may 27, 2014, in remarks at the national press club -- "who knows about obama? ... who knows, who knows? who cares right now?... i have my own theory on obama. someday i will write a book, i will do another book, and it will do very successfully." january 6, 2016, in an interview with cnn's wolf blitzer sure sounds like christie is wrong when he says that trump is not keeping the issue alive. don't ya think?       reality check: chris christie's whoppers on the birther issue      
__label__0 washington (cnn)hillary clinton's moment of truth with the obama coalition is fast approaching -- and she has work to do. the democratic nominee's effort to win over voters who twice put barack obama in the white house -- and who represent her best chance of victory in november -- will reach new intensity this week in the run-up to her first crucial debate clash in seven days. young, college-educated and minority voters formed the backbone of obama's majority in 2008, helping to put once reliably republican states like virginia and north carolina in the democratic column and shore up the battered incumbent in swing states like ohio and florida in 2012. but recent polls indicate the race tightened dramatically in recent weeks, with gop nominee donald trump on a roll. they suggest that clinton is lagging behind obama with younger voters and that she has failed to kindle the enthusiasm that drove them to the polls four and eight years ago. questions are also mounting about the scale of likely turnout among black and hispanic voters, who are expected to vote disproportionately for clinton but could let her down if they do not show up in sufficient numbers in battleground states. obama delivered a direct appeal to these voters over the weekend at the congressional black caucus dinner where he made a passionate plea to his supporters to show up in november for clinton. clinton eyes nc as a firewall in tightening race after appealing to forums of african-american and hispanic leaders in recent days, clinton will travel to crucial pennsylvania on monday to highlight the stakes for millennials. she previewed the likely thrust of her remarks last week in north carolina in a more personal, emotive stump speech that she retooled while laid up with pneumonia. "i am running for young people like so many of you here who dream of changing our world for the better," clinton said. in that speech, the democratic nominee also reached out to other sectors of the obama coalition, including lgbt voters, african americans and those who secured health care under the current president. clinton's running mate, virginia sen. tim kaine, made a forceful push for millennial votes on nbc's "meet the press" sunday, arguing that on the issues young people care about most, like climate change, women's health, college affordability, immigration reform and lgbt equality, there was only one possible choice in november. "it's on our shoulders to make the case. but on at least five litmus test issues, the differences between hillary clinton and donald trump are vast," kaine said. clinton's need to improve her standing among young voters has become apparent in recent polling. a quinnipiac university poll this month found that clinton was backed by 31% of voters aged 18-34 while 29% favored trump. but 44% of that group said they would vote for libertarian gary johnson or green party leader jill stein. other polls have also shown clinton needing to improve her standing among the younger demographic. if she does not, it could harm her election chances because she is far more dependent on the youth vote than trump, as the core republican vote skews much older. a cnn/orc poll last week had clinton leading trump by 54% to 29% among voters under the age of 45. but she's running behind obama, who beat romney 60% to 37% among the same group in 2012. while the former secretary of state has work to do to electrify the democratic coalition, she could not have better allies. most prominently, obama himself, enjoying some of the best approval ratings of his presidency, is emerging as a passionate, adamant fighter for her cause. first lady michelle obama is also taking on a key role. following her acclaimed speech at the democratic national convention this july, she told young voters in virginia last week that their choice in november would decide whether they could afford a college education and keep their health care when they graduate. even clinton's bitter primary rival, bernie sanders, who became a rock star on college campuses and among young voters, is beginning to become more prominent as an advocate warning of the dangers of a trump presidency. however, transferring support from one candidate to another is not just a simple matter of passing the baton. obama's popularity among democrats seems intimately attached to the president himself. his efforts to boost democrats in mid-term elections in 2010 and 2014 had little effect, and his record on picking winners in off-year races is also patchy. it's left the impression that his is a uniquely "obama" coalition that cannot be easily bequeathed to a successor. related: obama: would be 'personal insult' to legacy if black voters don't back clinton that may be one reason why obama's appeal to black voters at the congressional black caucus dinner on saturday was so striking; he figuratively put himself on the ticket in november, urging african americans to vote for him and his legacy. "my name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot," he said. "after we have achieved historic turnout in 2008 and 2012, especially in the african-american community, i will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election," obama said in strikingly direct remarks. "you want to give me a good sendoff? go vote." obama's press secretary josh earnest told cnn's "new day" on monday that the president's comments were aimed at voters who were turned off by the negativity of the campaign that the "stakes are too high" to tune out. "i think the impact is to send a clear message to the president's supporters across the country that even though his name isn't on the ballot, he feels passionately about the outcome of this race," earnest said. the process of transferring obama's african-american support to clinton was given a significant lift by trump's clumsy effort to lay to rest the "birther" controversy over his repeated false claims that the president may not have been born in the united states, and hence wasn't eligible for the country's highest office. though the gop nominee finally admitted on friday that obama was indeed born on american soil, he gave the controversy fresh life by claiming inaccurately that clinton's 2008 campaign started the furor and that he ended it -- despite pushing the rumor years after obama produced his birth certificate. "if you would ask me to come up with one thing that would ruin donald trump's momentum over the last three weeks, i would say bringing up the birther thing," said kevin madden, a former top romney strategist, on cnn's "state of the union sunday. "in many ways it has brought up new questions and in many ways it has put the spotlight again on donald trump in a very negative way." for her part, clinton, despite facing the historically daunting task of trying to win a third consecutive white house term for her party, is hugging obama close. she paid a fulsome tribute to the president at the cbc dinner and vowed to work tirelessly for a strong african-american turnout in november. "i want you to know i'm not taking your vote or anyone's vote for granted," she said. "i need your help over the next 52 days to bring our campaign across the finish line together." trump's cause, however, has been boosted by a string of recent polls showing that the gop nominee has all but neutralized clinton's big convention bounce. and his campaign is suggesting that she will fail to pull off the kind of high turnout among key democratic constituencies she needs to win in november. "bernie sanders had an event yesterday in ohio for hillary clinton. there were 150 people there," trump campaign manager kellyanne conway said on cbs "face the nation" sunday. "that's like a second wedding where i come from. this is not a big movement for hillary clinton." while the activity of last week and the coming one suggests that the clinton campaign is concerned about its candidate's progress in reassembling the obama coalition, the countdown to election day could serve to concentrate the minds of democratic voters. young voters are notoriously less likely to show up at the polls than older ones, but they confounded conventional wisdom when they repeatedly answered obama's call in primary elections and general elections. in 2012, republicans backing romney were adamant that obama would never recreate the kind of historic turnout, especially among black voters, that he had managed in 2008 when he leveraged the historic potential of the first african-american presidency. it was only on election day, when returns started trickling in from key counties in swing states from florida to ohio, that the romney brain trust learned how wrong they were. but with clinton's fate on the line, that coalition is now facing its final -- and most daunting -- test.       clinton's challenge: rebuilding obama's winning coalition      
__label__0 raleigh, north carolina (cnn)hillary clinton -- facing a dramatically tightening race and a troubling lack of enthusiasm -- is looking to this steadily changing state as an opportunity to stabilize her path to the white house and force republicans to play offense. clinton's challenge: rebuilding obama's winning coalition a sign of how seriously the democratic nominee is taking north carolina: it's the first place she visited last week when she returned to the campaign trail following a bout with pneumonia. president barack obama traveled to charlotte this summer for his first campaign appearance with clinton and is expected to return to the state repeatedly in october. the focus on north carolina -- a state president barack obama carried narrowly in 2008 but lost four years later -- comes as polls show clinton faltering in other battlegrounds such as florida and ohio. a win here would almost certainly offset losses in those states and guarantee her the presidency. and the raging culture war over lgbt rights playing out in the state offers her an opportunity to appeal to progressives and encourage them to show up on election day. clinton has reason for some cautious optimism. a quinnipiac poll released september 8 shows clinton with a 4-point lead, just outside the margin of error. "it's a coin toss," said j. michael bitzer, a political science professor at catawba college. "we are dealing with a 45/45 split. the electorate is baked, the remaining 10% are folks who will decide at the last minute, and say 'i can't stand either one.' we are in a holding pattern unless something monumental happens." why democrats are anxious republican nominee donald trump is fighting hard for the state. he held a rally last week in asheville and will be back in north carolina tuesday. but the election is playing out as the state is grappling with the fallout from house bill 2, the so-called bathroom bill that requires people to use the bathroom of their biological gender. it also bans municipalities from passing rules barring discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. since the legislation's passage earlier this year, north carolina -- with a long reputation as being one of the more progressive southern states -- has seen a blow to its image. the nba, ncaa, and acc have pulled major sporting events out of the state, resulting in millions in lost revenues, a substantial economic and cultural blow to a sport-crazy state. state politics upended and the state's politics have been upended. republican gov. pat mccrory is lagging his democratic challenger and gop sen. richard burr is in an unexpectedly competitive re-election race. democrats see the issue as a rallying call to engage the obama coalition and possibly, moderate republicans. "i'm running for the lgbt teenager here in north carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a second-class citizen," clinton said at her greensboro rally. "and if anyone wonders what the costs of discrimination are, just ask the people and businesses of north carolina." but carter wren, a republican strategist doubts that house bill 2 or mccrory's standing, will determine the presidential race here. "the polling stuff i have seen on hb2, it didn't cut, everybody had an opinion, but it didn't change how people vote," he said. "it's all about hillary and trump and mostly about character, that's what people are questioning more than the issues." kaine splits with clinton on some trump supporters as 'irredeemable' and clinton is facing the same trouble here that she is nationwide: ginning up enthusiasm -- especially among young voters -- that she'll need to replicate obama's winning coalition. even voters here who are enthused by clinton's candidacy recognize that others aren't that plugged into the race. "some of my friends are on the fence. they say trump is horrible, but they are not sure about clinton," said cydnee mebane, 19, who saw clinton speak in greensboro. "they say they won't vote or they will vote for a third party. with my generation, we are either apathetic or too smart for our own good." daisy goodwin, 65, was initially for clinton during the primaries in 2008, but flipped to obama. she expressed fear over what a trump presidency would look like, and frustration that during voter registration drives, "a lot of people said they aren't going to vote." 'where is oprah?' "she should bring barack and michelle. that will turn people out and we have to go door-to-door," said goodwin, a retired beautician from high point. "and where is oprah?" another challenge for democrats is broadening their appeal among white voters, who have been increasingly voting less democratic in southern states, a trend that can't be entirely offset by gains with other demographic groups. while the african american vote remained steady from 2008 to 2012, a notable share of white voters shifted from obama -- he won 31% of the white vote in 2012, down from 35% in 2008 according to exit polls. obama: would be 'personal insult' to legacy if black voters don't back clinton still, trump has clear vulnerabilities. "if i am trump, my problem is with undecided voters who supported [mitt] romney," wren said. "there are a fair amount of those people who voted for romney, don't like clinton but don't like trump." that's especially true in north carolina, a state with an influx of new residents drawn to a tech boom in cities like charlotte and raleigh. the population growth has swelled the ranks of unaffiliated and more educated voters. clinton and her allies have flooded the airwaves with millions in ads, targeting veterans, black millennials, suburban white voters and black churchgoers. nearly $13 million in tv ads have been reserved through november. priorities usa launched a $400,000 digital ad buy on facebook, instagram and pandora with one ad called "most racist person," where trump falsely claims that obama is not an american citizen. this past saturday, democratic volunteers from around the state gathered at different campaign offices to get pep talks before they fanned out to register new voters. democrats have boasted about their superior ground game, rattling off number of offices (33), paid staff (300) and volunteers (thousands). republicans counter that buildings don't vote. "office numbers are a false metric and completely miss the point that, as we saw in the primary, mr. trump is not a typical politician and attempts to measure the strength of his campaign by old world comparisons like these fail to reflect the enthusiasm and grass-roots support seen by the thousands of supporters and new voters he is attracting to his events and his campaign," said jason simmons, trump's north carolina state director. ultimately, the biggest question for clinton is whether she can pull off the coalition that united behind obama in 2008. he won at the time by orchestrating one of the most sophisticated and granular mobilization efforts the state has ever seen. buoyed by a jump in the registration and participation of black and younger voters, the obama campaign flipped a 13-point democratic defeat in 2004, to a 14,000-vote win just four years later. on monday and tuesday, the mothers of the movement -- women who have lost their children to gun violence or at the hands of the police -- will stump for clinton here. "it was a very strong effort to reach the young people, you have a huge hbcu population down there and we had a very well-organized church strategy," said rick c. wade, who was obama's national black vote director in 2008. "it was the inspiration that obama represented and i think that's the challenge. how do you get hillary to connect with those folks?"       clinton eyes nc as a firewall in tightening race

threat terrorism is already casting a particularly dark shadow over this meeting, as new york police investigate a saturday bombing in manhattan that injured 29 people. it occurred on the same day that a blast disrupted a marine corps charity run in new jersey and a man stabbed nine people at a minnesota mall. all three incidents are being investigated as possible terror attacks and security around un events will likely be even more stringent than usual. global leaders will hold special breakout sessions on refugees, syria and libya, where instability has also created openings for isis and other extremist groups. they'll address other priorities, too, including climate change, human rights, sustainable development and un reform. heightened tension on the sidelines, obama will meet with world leaders. on monday, he's set to discuss north korea's nuclear tests and other asian issues with chinese premier li keqiang. on wednesday, obama will review a newly signed $38 billion aid package for israel with its prime minister benjamin netanyahu and discuss the prospects for mideast peace. he'll also meet with leaders such as iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi and colombian president juan manuel santos. amid the week-long swirl of meetings at the iconic rectangular un building bordering manhattan's east river, there will also be the usual smaller dramas: the leaders who use their speeches to denounce rivals in impolitic ways and heated speculation about potentially fraught or historic meetings. last year, a tense meeting between obama and russian president vladimir putin was swiftly followed by moscow's intervention in syria. this year, existing tensions will be heightened by a us strike on syrian forces that the military had thought was an isis target, administration officials said. russia called an emergency un security council meeting, arguing that the saturday strike showed the us isn't fully committed to cooperating with moscow on the fight against militant groups including isis and warned that the syrian ceasefire might break down as a result. "we consider what happened as a natural result of the persistent refusal of the united states from the establishment of close cooperation with russia in the fight against isis, jabhat al-nusra and other affiliated terrorist groups," the russian foreign ministry said in a statement sunday. secretary of state john kerry and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov, the architects of the nascent ceasefire, are expected to meet and may offer an update on its progress. the us ambassador to the un, samantha power, expressed regret for the loss of life saturday, but added that, "even by russia's standards, tonight's stunt -- a stunt replete with moralism and grandstanding -- is uniquely cynical and hypocritical." iran question since 2011, power said, "the assad regime has been intentionally striking civilian targets with horrifying, predictable regularity." the 2015 general assembly also featured a historic handshake between obama and iranian president hassan rouhani. this year, with the iran nuclear deal under fire in tehran and a tight us presidential campaign underway, political observers wonder if the two men will meet again. state department deputy spokesman mark toner couldn't say if even kerry will meet officially with his iranian counterparts, men he knows well from months of nuclear talks. "we just don't have anything to confirm at this point," toner said. kerry also met sunday with asian allies to discuss north korea and tensions in the south china sea as a rising beijing asserts itself in the region. amid all this, the us will be focusing on "three topline priorities," according to bathsheba crocker, the state department's assistant secretary for international organizations, listing "humanitarian response, peace and security, and countering terrorism and violent extremism." kerry will touch on humanitarian needs at a high-level monday meeting on refugees. the next day, obama hosts a leaders summit on refugees. the us announced wednesday that it will increase the number of refugees it absorbs from 85,000 this year to 110,000 in 2017. and on friday, the administration said it would give $11 million to a un fund that helps countries accepting refugees. waves of people fleeing countries such as syria, south sudan and afghanistan have overwhelmed the international refugee system. unprecedented strains according to the un, more than 21 million people are displaced today, half of them children, all of them in need of food, shelter, safety and livelihoods. they are placing unprecedented strains on their host countries, driving the rise of right-leaning anti-immigrant political parties in europe and becoming a divisive us presidential campaign issue as well. in april, republican candidate donald trump warned a crowd to "lock your doors" to stay safe from syrian refugees, and in june added that "a lot of those people are isis." crocker said obama's leader summit on tuesday aims to yield "significant sustained commitments to un humanitarian appeals, expanded refugee resettlement programs or alternative legal pathways for admission, and new opportunities for refugees and their host communities to benefit from improved refugee access to education and legal employment." tuesday will also mark obama's final address to the un as president.       global leaders at un tackle world's worst to-do list      
__label__0 washington (cnn)russia doesn't have the ability to tamper with american election results, but has been warned by president barack obama on down about even trying, secretary of state john kerry said. the nation's top diplomat, in an interview with cnn's elise labott, said, "we have made it crystal clear to russia to what the consequences might be. the president, myself, we've had conversations, we know what's happening, we are being vigilant." concerns about hacking into us election systems have heightened in the wake of digital break-ins to democratic campaign organizations, which federal authorities have linked to russian intelligence services. "i do not believe russia will have the ability to effect this election and we are going to be absolutely vigilant about it," kerry said. "the president has made that clear and russia is warned." kerry, the 2004 democratic presidential nominee, also recalled the exhilaration and exhaustion of a national campaign's final stretch. "right now you're getting into october. october is the month when your juices, your blood really begins to flow. you're down to 30 days," said the former massachusetts senator. "you've been at this for two years plus whatever it is. uh, it's exhausting but you can see the end, the stakes really descend on you. you really have a sense of just how much is up for grabs here in terms of the future of our nation. and i think that energizes, that clarifies the focus, it provides an intensity and a passion. and i'm confident that over the next month we will see a sharpening, if you will, of the differences of the arguments between the candidates." but kerry declined to weigh in on specifics of the tight race between hillary clinton, his predecessor at foggy bottom, and republican nominee donald trump. in the interview kerry was also sharply critical of russia for failing to enforce a ceasefire agreement in syria, calling on russia to "stop the grandstanding, stop the showboating and get the humanitarian assistance going." kerry's comments come as convoys carrying humanitarian aid are blocked from reaching some of syria's hardest-hit areas. "it is now sunday morning. this started monday night of last week -- this past week. and the humanitarian assistance is supposed to be flowing," kerry said. he pinned the blame on syrian president bashar al-assad, who is at war with insurgents. the united states and russia are split on who they back in the syrian civil war, but are attempting to work together to combat terror groups in the country. kerry complained that assad's government is blocking the aid and has continued the violence, and said russia must pressure assad. "the regime, once again, is blocking it. so russia's client, russia's supported friend, is the single biggest blockade to the ability to move forward here," kerry said. "so let me just say this clearly: russia signed up to a cessation of hostilities. assad said he would live by it. then he needs to stop and let the joint implementation center get set up so russia and the united states can coordinate in order to avoid the kind of terrible thing that happened yesterday that we all acknowledge and regret," kerry said. his comments come the day after the us-led coalition fighting isis admitted it struck syrian forces rather than a terror target. kerry also issued a broader call for russia to pressure assad. "the biggest judgment they need to make is to stop assad from bombing people indiscriminately, which he continues to do," the secretary of state said. "and if you are serious about having a ceasefire, and they say they are, then they should keep assad from flying right now and prove their sincerity about a ceasefire," he said. "but to allow assad -- who is a spoiler; he doesn't want a ceasefire -- to allow him to continue to go after opposition, pretending that they are nusra, is in and of itself a huge challenge to this effort." kerry said "there are no good options" to stop the crisis in syria, and that the options that do exist are "ugly." "one option is trying to move toward a ceasefire and trying to get to the table to have a negotiation. but the other option moves to more arms in the area, more fighting, more destruction, more migrants, more refugees. more children, women, schools, hospitals hit. literally, possibly the destruction of syria as an entire nation and state. and it is getting close to that even now," kerry said. "so the options are not pretty. but you've got to put to test the seriousness of purpose of a nation." he acknowledged that defense secretary ash carter and others at the pentagon have expressed reservations about a ceasefire agreement and in trusting russia to help enforce it. "nothing in this agreement is based on trust," he said. "it is based on very specific steps that each side has to take. and that includes pulling back from this key access road in the north near aleppo. it includes restraining both sides, assad, and for us, the opposition, from engaging. and then it includes the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and delivering a real cessation of hostilities." kerry also weighed in on the explosion saturday night in new york city, saying "the security in the city of new york will be unparalleled as it always is" in the wake of the incident. "i'm not concerned about that. but i think we need to be concerned for every american and for the folks in new york on a day-to-day basis. understand what's going on. the teams are doing that and as i said, they could not be more qualified or capable," he said.       kerry: russia 'is warned' about tampering attempts on us elections systems      
__label__0 (cnn)donald trump reacted to a series of bombing threats and attacks over the weekend with a warning on monday that "this is only going to get worse." "i think this is something that will maybe get -- will happen perhaps more and more all over the country," trump told "fox and friends." "it's a mess, and it's a shame, and we're going to have to be very tough." trump also said he agreed with early reports of a possible foreign connection to the bombings. "i think there is -- i think there's many foreign connections," he said. "you have many, many groups, because we're allowing these people to come into our country and destroy our country and make it unsafe for people," the republican nominee added, arguing that the stricter immigration policies he has proposed would better protect the us from terror. trump also took aim at "magazines" and other media that publish instructions on how to make explosive devices, saying, "those people should be arrested because they are inciting violence." "so i see the other day, and they're all talking about it so wonderfully because it's called freedom of the press -- where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make the same bombs that you saw. i would -- now people will go crazy, they'll say trump is against freedom of the press. i'm totally in favor of freedom of the press. but how do you allow magazines to be sold -- these are magazines that tell you, from step one, go to the store and buy such-and-such, right?" he continued, "those people should be arrested because they are inciting violence, ok. they are making violence possible. they should be arrested immediately. they have websites that tell how to make bombs, how to make all sorts of things that are totally destructive, and you know where they are coming from, and yet we don't want to touch them because of freedom of speech."       trump reacts to bombings: 'this is only going to get worse'      
__label__0 (cnn)former president bill clinton sought to address concerns about his family's namesake foundation in an interview monday, admitting that while "it was natural" for donors to seek favors from the clintons, he'd "trusted" that the state department under hillary clinton would appropriately handle potential conflicts of interest. "it was natural for people who've been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. and i trusted the state department wouldn't do anything they shouldn't do," clinton told npr in an interview that aired monday morning. he also maintained that he would sever his connection to the clinton foundation if hillary clinton is elected president to remove any conflict-of-interest concerns, though he acknowledged the move would be "hard." "it is hard, but you know, if hillary is elected, i'm looking forward to it," clinton said. he noted that he's worked for the foundation "longer than i've ever had any job -- and i loved it." "and you know, we always say in response to our critics that nobody in my family ever took a penny out of this foundation and put millions of dollars in. but i would have paid more to do this job. it was the most fun thing i've ever done," clinton added. the former president pushed back on criticism that donors to the clintons foundation engaged in a "pay-to-play" scheme, whereby donations to the foundation bought influence with hillary clinton during her term as secretary of state. he pointed to the lack of evidence of any such quid-pro-quos, and accused critics of "smearing" him and his wife, according to npr. "in real life, if somebody tells a lie about you, and i find out it is, i like you more and them less. in political life, they just keep on smearing you -- even if it all comes to nothing -- people will like you less and won't hold anybody accountable for what they say." clinton also praised his wife for weathering criticism during her presidential campaign. "i wonder if there's a man in america that could have taken what she's been through in the last year and a half."       bill clinton: 'natural' for foundation donors to seek favors      
__label__0 (cnn)a top aide to ohio gov. john kasich criticized republican national committee chairman reince priebus after the party chairman warned of consequences for former presidential candidates like kasich who've refused to back donald trump for president, despite signing loyalty pledges during the primary. "the idea of a greater purpose beyond oneself may be alien to political party bosses like reince priebus, but it is at the center of everything governor kasich does," said john weaver, kasich's chief strategist. "he will not be bullied by a kenosha political operative that is unable to stand up for core principles or beliefs." weaver was responding to priebus' appearance on cbs' "face the nation" on sunday. during that interview, the rnc chairman suggested that gop presidential candidates who'd signed pledges to back the eventual republican nominee during the 2016 primary, but who have since withheld support for trump's candidacy, could be prevented from running for president again by the party. kasich has repeatedly said he does not plan to endorse trump. "those people need to get on board," priebus said. "and if they're thinking they're going to run again someday, i think that we're going to evaluate the process -- of the nomination process and i don't think it's going to be that easy for them." "people in our party are talking about what we're going to do about this. i mean there's a ballot access issue in south carolina. in order to be on the ballot in south carolina, you actually have to pledge your support to the nominee, no matter who that person is," he explained. "so what's the penalty for that? it's not a threat, but that's just the question that we have a process in place."       kasich aide slams rnc chair reince priebus over trump support remark      
__label__0 (cnn)one of the big winners at the emmys on sunday night delivered some of the harshest criticism of donald trump offstage -- comparing the republican presidential nominee to adolf hitler and warning against what she said were efforts to "otherize" groups of people. jill soloway, creator of amazon's "transparent" and winner in the comedy series directing category, spoke to "variety" backstage during the awards show, where she lit into trump. "jews were other-ized in nazi germany to gain political power for hitler, and right now donald trump is doing the same thing. he's other-izing people. he calls women pigs if they don't look like beauty pageant contestants. he blames muslims and mexicans for our problems. he makes fun of disabled people. this is other-izing with a capital 'o,'" soloway said. she continued, "it has been used in our history before to start and win wars. he needs to be called out at every chance he gets for being one of the most dangerous monsters to ever approach our lifetimes. he's a complete dangerous monster, and at any moment that i have to call out trump for being an inheritor to hitler, i will." cnn has reached out to trump campaign for comment and not yet received a response. with the criticism, soloway delivered one of the sharpest trump condemnations at the awards show -- but she was far from alone, as the program featured a series of actors, directors and producers who slammed the gop nominee. "transparent" lead actor jeffrey tambor, another winner who was backstage during the exchange, said he agreed, according to variety. and he reportedly quoted the poet w.h. auden, saying "love one another or die." david mandel -- the showrunner of hbo's "veep," which also won multiple awards, and who was also present backstage -- joked that his show, which satirizes politics, couldn't keep up with trump. "there are days when things we think of pale in comparison to that mad man threatening hillary clinton not once but twice," mandel said, according to "variety." "if i wrote that, i'd get fired by hbo. i find the level of discourse in this campaign horrific." he added, "a lot of people don't want to laugh about this stuff."       transparent creator calls trump 'inheritor to hitler' after emmy win      
__label__0 the axe files, featuring david axelrod, is a podcast distributed by cnn and produced at the university of chicago institute of politics. the author works for david axelrod. kiev, ukraine (cnn)despite improving poll numbers, donald trump still faces the political equivalent of pulling an inside straight if he is to succeed to the presidency, says karl rove, mastermind behind both of president george w. bush's presidential campaigns. "democrats have an easier path to 270 electoral college votes than republicans," rove told david axelrod on "the axe files" podcast, produced by the university of chicago institute of politics and cnn. that advantage makes hillary clinton the continued front-runner in the race headed into next week's critical first debate, rove said.  "he's got to win all the romney states, and as you know, three of them are up for grabs -- north carolina, he's behind; arizona, georgia, barely ahead. he's got to win florida, got to win ohio, but that only gets him to 253. he's got to find another 17, and i think he'll win nevada, i think he'll win iowa, but even then that only gets him to 265. and that last five, he's got to win either new hampshire and the second district of maine, or pennsylvania, or michigan, or wisconsin." rove, a columnist for the wall street journal, is a chairman of the crossroads super pac, which has thus far refused to deploy its significant resources on trump's behalf, focusing instead on preserving republican control of the united states senate. the gop entered the year in an uphill battle for the senate, with six republican incumbents running for reelection in blue states president obama carried in 2012. democrats must seize five seats, or win four and the presidency, to wrest control of the upper chamber away from the gop.  rove says republican chances of holding the senate are "better than 50-50," in part because this year's electorate has "a record number of undecideds, a record number of weak adherents" who do not want to give either presidential nominee "a blank check." the conversation with rove was taped in kiev, ukraine, around the yalta european strategy conference, at which rove and axelrod participated in a panel discussion on the american election. during the panel, rove, who has been a persistent critic of trump on issues such as immigration and trade, pointedly declined several invitations to say he would vote for the republican nominee this fall. in his "axe files" conversation with axelrod, rove suggested that should trump lose in november, rove said republicans could look to their party in texas, a diverse state where the gop has firm control, for clues as to how to proceed. "we're a party in texas that represents the diversity of our state. ... i think that's the formula for republicans, and it doesn't involve sort of changing your principles; it involves sharing your principles with every community in every corner of the state." to hear the whole conversation with rove, which also covered rove's rise in politics; his misgivings, based on what he knows today, about the 2003 decision to invade iraq; and the tragic family histories he and axelrod share, click on http://podcast.cnn.com. to get "the axe files" podcast every week, subscribe at http://itunes.com/theaxefiles.       karl rove: electoral map still favors hillary clinton over donald trump

__label__0 white plains, new york (cnn)hillary clinton cast herself monday morning as the only presidential candidate who has fought terrorism and slammed donald trump's response to the incidents in new york, new jersey and minnesota over the weekend as "demagogic." in a news conference on the tarmac of westchester county airport, the democratic presidential nominee said she has been "part of the hard decision to take terrorists off the battlefield," and contrasted her steadiness to what she called trump's "irresponsible, reckless rhetoric." "it is like so much else he says: it is not grounded in fact, it is meant to make some kind of demagogic point," clinton said. "i am prepared to, ready to actually take on those challenges, not engage in a lot of irresponsible, reckless rhetoric." an explosive device went off in the chelsea neighborhood of manhattan over the weekend, once again thrusting the politics of terror into the center of the 2016 election. clinton and trump initially responded to the incident in contrasting styles: trump was quick to announce that a bomb had gone off in new york, even before there was much information about the incident; clinton, meanwhile, urged caution, and the importance of waiting to draw conclusions until more information was available. trump campaign spokesman jason miller said that the clinton campaign accused the republican nominee of treason and criticized her previous stances on the war in iraq. "if clinton really wants to find the real cause of isis, she needs to take a long, hard look in the mirror," miller said. in her news conference monday morning, clinton also warned against the instinct to villainize entire groups of people based on religion. asked about ahmad khan rahami -- in custody following a police shootout after he was allegedly seen on video near the bombing -- and whether his afghan descent will help trump politically, clinton said: "there are millions of law-abiding, peaceful muslim americans." "that is why i have been very clear. we are going after the bad guys and we are going to get them, but we are not going to go after an entire religion and give isis exactly what it is wanting," clinton said. clinton's news conference offered no new policies to fight terror. she argued, as she has before, that the united states needs to invest more in intelligence to combat lone wolf attacks. the former secretary of state also called on tech companies in silicon valley to "give us the tools and lead us to those who are attempting to promote attacks like we have seen." clinton has given speeches on defeating terror multiple times throughout the 2016 campaign, including policy-focused addresses in minneapolis and new york earlier this year.       clinton slams trump's 'demagogic' rhetoric on terror      
__label__0 new york (cnn)president barack obama worked to calm americans' jitters monday after a series of attempts at mass violence, suggesting that yielding to fear amounted to a win for terrorists. during two appearances in new york, obama praised the swift work of law enforcement authorities looking into duel bomb attacks in new york and new jersey over the weekend. and he urged americans to follow the lead of residents here by not submitting to fear. "i think it is important to remember what terrorists and violent extremists are trying to do. they are trying to hurt innocent people, but they also want to inspire fear in all of us, and disrupt the way we live to undermine our values," obama said. "we all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don't succumb to that fear. and there is no better example of that than the people of new york and new jersey." "folks around here, you know, they don't get scared. they are tough, they are resilient, they go about their business every single day. and that kind of toughness and resoluteness and a recognition that neither individuals nor organizations like isil can ultimately undermine our way of life," obama said. "that's the kind of strength that makes me so proud to be an american." the president was speaking monday morning from a hotel in midtown manhattan, where he's attending his final united nations general assembly meeting. two miles south, in chelsea, investigations were still piecing together evidence following a bomb explosion in a dumpster saturday night, which injured dozens. related: ny, nj bombings: suspect wounded, arrested after shootout; 2 officers hit the attack appeared linked to another explosion in seaside park, new jersey, and a series of pipe bombs found in a backpack sunday night in elizabeth, new jersey. a third incident in minnesota, where a man stabbed nine people before being shot, is being investigated separately as a "potential act of terrorism," obama said. monday afternoon, obama said he'd spoken with law enforcement officers who helped apprehend ahmad khan rahami, a suspect in this weekend's bomb attacks in new york and new jersey, and hailed their actions as heroic. he also said he phoned an off-duty officer who neutralized the attacker in minnesota. "it's just one more reminder of the skill and sacrifice and what they put on the line every single day to make sure we're safe," obama said following talks with iraq's prime minister haider al-abadi. an isis wing claimed responsibility for the minnesota attack, though obama avoided pinning any specific motivation on the attacks during his appearances on monday. he did, however, insist his administration was going after the terror group aggressively to prevent any further violence. "we will continue to lead the global coalition on the fight to destroy isil, which is instigating a lot of people over the internet, to carry out attacks," obama said, using the administration's term for the islamic state group. "we are going to continue to go after them. we're going to take out their leaders, we're going to take out their infrastructure." following his talks with abadi, obama conceded retaking iraq's second largest city from the terror group would be difficult. "this is going to be challenging," obama said of long-held plans to liberate mosul. "we feel confident that we will be in a position to move forward fairly rapidly." "it will be a tough fight...this is going to be hard, this is going to be challenging," obama continued, adding he would support and assistance from other countries and from us lawmakers.       obama: 'we all have a role to play' in terror fight after suspected bombings

__label__0 washington (cnn)new jersey gov. chris christie knew about the september 2013 lane closures at the george washington bridge while they were going on, federal prosecutors alleged in court monday during the opening statements for their case against two former christie confidantes. prosecutors revealed monday that they will show christie was told about the traffic in fort lee, new jersey, and that fort lee mayor mark sokolich's public safety concerns were ignored, us department of justice public affairs officer, matthew reilly told cnn. after an unsuccessful run for president, the governor is now chairing the transition effort of republican presidential nominee donald trump. assistant us attorney vikas khanna said former christie confidante and port authority executive david wildstein will testify that he told christie about the plan to close lanes on the george washington bridge while it was causing traffic problems in fort lee, new jersey, where the mayor was a political rival of christie. christie's former deputy chief of staff, bridget anne kelly, and former port authority deputy executive director bill baroni have pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges in connection to the lane closures, an incident that has come to be known by some as "bridgegate." text about christie: he 'flat-out lied' christie has never been named as a conspirator in the case or charged. wildstein has pled guilty in the case and pointed to the two staffers on trial. when asked whether monday's assertions mean charges could be coming for christie, reilly said, "we have not filed any charges and we never discuss whether we will/won't file charges." cnn has reached out to christie's office, as well as the offices of baroni and kelly's attorneys for comment. a source with ongoing knowledge of the case has told cnn that monday's assertions by the prosecutor that christie knew about bridge-gate came as a surprise because christie has never been charged in the case, and because up until now the prosecutors have said they were not bringing charges against the governor. christie told cnn's jake tapper sunday that he would testify if subpoenaed, but didn't expect to be called as a witness. "of course i will," christie told tapper on "state of the union." "i have been investigated by three different entities, two of them led by partisan democrats, who have all found that i had no knowledge of this incident and no involvement in it. and so i would have no problem if called to testify by either side. but the fact is that i won't because i really don't have any knowledge of this incident at all." the traffic headache was allegedly intentionally called for because sokolich did not endorse christie's re-election. baroni and kelly allegedly "bragged" to christie about the fact that there were traffic problems in fort lee and that sokolich was not getting his calls returned, prosecutors said in court according to reilly. baroni's attorneys have sought to argue that baroni is being unfairly singled out in the scheme. in a previous court filing, the attorneys released a text message exchange from a christie aide saying he "flat-out lied" during a news conference about the bridge closures. christie had said senior staff were not involved in that news event. he later said that staff in his office lied, but that he hadn't known it at the time of the news conference. attorneys for kelly and baroni previously confirmed to cnn that they will both testify in their defense. the trial is expected to last six weeks. christie has long denied any involvement in the closures and neither the federal investigation nor the new jersey legislative inquiry has pointed to him. in december 2015, when they were opponents, trump told an audience in south carolina christie "totally knew about it," referring to the bridgegate closures. the trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.       prosecutor in bridgegate trial: chris christie knew of closures      
__label__0 philadelphia (cnn)hillary clinton made a direct appeal monday to a demographic group that continues to be deeply skeptical of the democratic nominee: millennials. addressing a largely younger crowd here at temple university, clinton argued that her republican opponent, donald trump, does not share their values, and that in contrast, she has fought her entire life for children and young people and would be their biggest advocate in the white house. clinton said that young people she has spoken with to over the course of this campaign have expressed concerns about divisiveness and discrimination. "too many young black men and women made to feel like their lives are disposable; too many immigrants living in fear of deportation; too many young lgbt americans, bullied; too many young women and men assaulted," clinton said. clinton emphasized efforts to promote affordable tuition and combat college debt. these topics were at the core of the presidential campaign of bernie sanders -- the raspy, populist vermont senator who proved to be formidable challenger to clinton as he overwhelmingly won the support of young people and liberals. "as you know better than most, tuition keeps going through the roof and debt keeps piling up," clinton said. the crowd broke out into cheers as clinton continued: "i worked with bernie sanders on a plan." in a speech that drew on her history as a young democratic activist as well as personal anecdotes about her mother, clinton openly acknowledged this obvious truth: that young people are disenchanted and disillusioned with the current political system. "i remember wrestling with the challenge when i was a student during the vietnam war," clinton said. "it can be tempting to think that no one will tell you the truth and nothing is ever going to change." younger voters overwhelmingly backed president barack obama in 2012 -- giving him a 29 point lead over republican nominee mitt romney, according to exit polls. in 2008, obama easily outpolled republican john mccain among -- 66% to 32%. but the enthusiasm that young voters -- including many first-time voters -- showered on obama, however, has not transferred over to clinton. one obstacle getting in clinton's way: third party candidates. a recent new york times/cbs news poll found that 36% of voters under 30 plan to support libertarian candidate gary johnson or the green party's jill stein. with just 50 days left until election day, the clinton campaign is relying heavily on popular, big-name democratic surrogates to help court undecided and unenthusiastic voters. last week, it dispatched obama, first lady michelle obama, sanders and massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren to battleground states. and priorities usa, a super pac backing clinton, announced last week that they are launching a multimillion-dollar digital campaign to discuss "how a vote for a third-party candidate is a vote for donald trump." priorities has conducted polling on voters backing johnson and stein -- research they will use to determine how those individuals can be persuaded to back clinton, according to priorities spokesman justin barasky. the lead that clinton has enjoyed since the democratic national convention in july has largely evaporated, and she is now neck-and-neck with trump in both national and swing state polls. "this is going to be close. we need everyone off the sidelines," clinton said monday. "not voting is not an option. that just plays into trump's hands." a vote against trump, clinton concluded, would show that world that "america is better than this. america is better than donald trump."       clinton goes after disenchanted millennials with warning about trump      
__label__0 (cnn)on the campaign battlefield, donald trump follows a doctrine of disproportionate force. even 50 days out from the election, after countless attempted "pivots" to a steadier pose, his impulses -- to meet even a modest political jab, unflattering piece of reporting, or polite interruption with deeply personal attacks -- remain mostly unchecked. he was back at it this weekend with harsh assaults on a former defense secretary and a new york times columnist. during the long primary season, trump responded to criticism from his opponents with mocking nicknames and scornful insults. then it was hillary clinton's turn. along the way, the parents of a slain war hero, a federal judge, reporters, and even a pastor from flint, michigan, have been confronted with the same lopsided tactics. here are some of trump's most pointed reprisals. hints that former defense sec. bob gates has 'a problem' robert gates has some concerns with donald trump. the former defense secretary, who served under both presidents george w. bush and barack obama, called the republican nominee "cavalier" and "willfully ignorant" in a wall street journal op-ed last week. the piece was also frequently critical of clinton, but called trump beyond repair. "he's a nasty guy," trump said saturday of gates, whom he also called "an absolute clown." "probably has a problem that we don't know about." trump has not elaborated on the nature of the "problem." earlier in the day, the republican nominee, in a tweet, assigned gates a nickname -- "dopey" -- before criticizing him for speaking "badly of his many bosses, including obama." it wasn't the first time trump seemed to chalk up their differences to a lack of facetime. "he knows nothing about me" he tweeted. "but look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster!" describes flint pastor as a "nervous mess" when rev. faith green timmons briefly interrupted him, asking that he steer clear of political attacks, during a speech at her church in flint, michigan, trump promptly quit and reversed course. "ok, that's good," he said, almost sheepishly. "then i'm going back onto flint, ok?" he did -- and it was. for a few hours. but by the next morning, trump was lashing out at the pastor, calling her a "nervous wreck." "she was so nervous, she was shaking," he told fox news. "and i said, 'wow, this was kind of strange.' and then she came up. so she had that in mind, no question about it." critical women = 'neurotic' on the subject of nervous conditions: trump responded to new york times columnist maureen dowd, who told cnn on saturday that the candidate "thought the violence (at rallies) added a frisson of excitement," in a familiar tone. in the first of two tweets, he called dowd "wacky" and a "neurotic dope." a minute later, she was "crazy." if that looks familiar, it's because trump has repeatedly used the same language to insult other female critics. in august, it was msnbc host mika brzezinski. "tried watching low-rated @morning_joe this morning, unwatchable!," he tweeted. brzezinski "is off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess! and about a month earlier, when now-former democratic national committee chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz resigned ahead of the party's convention in philadelphia, trump chimed in by calling her "highly neurotic." a couple weeks earlier, after supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg called trump "a faker" -- a comment for which she would later apologize -- he took a similar shot at her mental state. "her mind is shot," he tweeted. "resign!" repeated swipes at the family of slain war hero trump targeted the parents of army capt. humayun khan, killed in 2004 by a suicide bomber in iraq, in a prolonged back-and-forth in the days after the democratic national convention. in an impassioned speech on the convention's final night, khizr khan, the soldier's father, said to trump, "you have sacrificed nothing and no one," then offered to lend the gop nominee a copy of his pocket-sized u.s. constitution. the barb did not sit well. trump first suggested that the slain soldier's mother, who stood quietly by her husband's side during his remarks, had been muzzled by her religion. "his wife, if you look at his wife, she was standing there. she had nothing to say," trump said during an interview with abc news. "maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say." (a day later, mrs. khan explained in an op-ed that she had been silenced only by her grief.) upset that khizr khan appeared on television after his speech, he continued his barrage on twitter, first writing, "mr. khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the dnc and is now all over t.v. doing the same - nice!" then, 17 minutes later: "this story is not about mr. khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather radical islamic terrorism and the u.s. get smart!" calls reporter a 'sleaze' during a news conference before he mostly shut out the press and eschewed news conferences, trump gathered the media at new york's trump tower in late may to provide information and answer questions about his fundraising for veterans groups. but the republican nominee soon maligned the press for not offering what he considered to be proper credit for his charitable giving. abc news reporter tom llamas called out trump for exaggerating the initial totals. "mr. trump, writing a $1 million check is incredibly generous, but the night of the iowa fundraiser, you said you had raised $6 million," llamas began. "clearly you had not. your critics say you tend to exaggerate, you have a problem with the truth. is this a prime example?" trump immediately rejected the math, saying he expected the number would eventually surpass $6 million, then turned on llamas, eventually calling him "a sleaze." when a reporter asked if a trump presidency would take on a similar tone, the billionaire businessman responded, "yeah, it is going to be like this." "you think i'm going to change?" he said. "i'm not going to change." references judge's 'mexican' heritage after court ruling after u.s. district court judge gonzalo curiel ordered the since-shuttered trump university's "playbooks" to be made public, the candidate and his allies launched a series of attacks centered on curiel's latino background. "this should have been dismissed on summary judgment easily, everybody says it. but i have judge who is a hater of donald trump, a hater. he's a hater," trump told supporters at a rally in may, saying curiel is "we believe, mexican, which is great." trump spokeswoman katrina pierson then suggested on cnn's "new day" that curiel's membership in la raza lawyer's association made him biased and tried to tie him to anti-trump protesters. slams conservative opponent bill kristol over opposition in late may and june, trump launched a days-long offensive against weekly standard editor bill kristol, a never-trumper who was recruiting a conservative third-party challenger. "if dummy bill kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an independent, say goodbye to the supreme court!" trump tweeted, before doubling down at press conference days later, when he labeled kristol a "loser," "not a smart person" and "such a fool." elizabeth warren as 'pocahontas' when massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren sought to match trump's twitter fire, using some of the same harsh language he has made a staple of the campaign, he responded in kind -- and upped the ante, repeatedly calling her "pocahontas," a reference to the 2012 controversy over her claimed native american heritage. since warren emerged as one of his chief antagonists, trump has been unyielding in his attacks. "i find it offensive that goofy elizabeth warren, sometimes referred to as pocahontas, pretended to be native american to get in harvard," he tweeted last week. (warren, a former harvard professor, noted in her response that she did not attend the college as a student.) trump in march interrupted a reporter trying to ask a question about warren, asking sarcastically, "who's that, the indian? you mean the indian?" repeated attacks on megyn kelly fox news anchor megyn kelly has been targeted repeatedly by trump after she asked a pointed question about his past remarks regarding women at the first gop debate last august. initially retweeting supporters who called her a "bimbo" and other offensive terms, trump dialed it up a couple days later. "you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes," he told cnn's don lemon during an interview about the exchange. "blood coming out of her wherever." trump has launched sporadic volleys of invective against kelly in the months that followed, calling her "crazy" and calling for a "boycott" of her show. the current detente followed a private meeting and then an interview special, but not before fox news put out a press release labeling trump's "sick obsession" with kelly as being "beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate who wants to occupy the highest office in the land." turning on ted cruz -- big league it seems like a while back now, but trump and his old primary rival ted cruz began the political season in a rather chummy pose. the texas senator refrained from criticizing the billionaire businessman even as trump mocked john mccain last july for having been captured and held as pow during the vietnam war. during debates, cruz mostly kept his distance from the front-runner, repeatedly dodging opportunities to poke him. but as the campaign heated up and the field dwindled, cruz went on the attack. trump's response was devastating. cruz quickly became "lyin' ted" and, before it was all over, trump had threatened to "spill the beans" on the senator's wife and repeatedly peddled a conspiracy theory linking his father to jfk assassin lee harvey oswald.       donald trump opens the personal insult vault (again)      
__label__0 (cnn)the mistaken us-led coalition bombing of a syrian military position saturday may have happened because the personnel weren't wearing military uniforms and didn't have standard military weapons, several us military officials told cnn. officials said they now think the personnel bombed may have been syrian military prisoners, according to several us defense officials. that's a working theory of how us, british, danish and australian aircraft may have incorrectly assessed intelligence and targeted the site that killed more than 60 syrian personnel near deir ezzor in eastern syria. the uk ministry of defence is saying it used drones in the strike. officials emphasized there are no final conclusions by the us about who was struck. overhead imagery and interviews with those involved will have to be assessed. but the us is not disputing that syrian personnel were hit. the us is trying to determine what specifically led to the mistaken strike and how the personnel may have been misidentified. syria ceasefire under threat after us-led strikes kill regime troops, russia says officials told cnn they believe a likely scenario is the personnel hit were prisoners of the regime, perhaps military personnel being detained, although that is not certain. the initial signs indicate they were dressed in civilian clothing. they also may not have had the typical weapons of a syrian military unit but rather trucks with weapons mounted on top of them. it is also not known if they were deliberately placed there to potentially deceive the coalition. the strike happened about two kilometres outside the airport in deir ezzor, where the us did not expect syrian forces to be located. the us had struck isis strongholds in the area of deir ezzor dozens of times in recent months, but had not seen syrian forces at this location. syria ceasefire: is bashar al-assad preparing to breach it? gen. joseph votel, head of us central command, has appointed a one-star general to conduct an investigation, but as of early monday that name had not been released. the us expressed regret for the incident, but it still sparked a furious diplomatic row at an emergency un security council meeting over the weekend. the us remains insistent that it does not target syrian forces, only isis and al qaeda, officials said. while the strike has raised tensions with russia over the effort to make a potential ceasefire work, it also comes as the pace of operations against isis strongholds in iraq's mosul and syria's raqqa is picking up. in northern syria, us special operations forces remain partnered with turkish forces and plan to move with them throughout the area, including the town of al rai. us officials told cnn that despite video emerging last week that appeared to show turkish and us forces being asked to leave the town, they have remained in the area. there is also growing intelligence that isis is hunkering down for major combat in mosul as iraqi forces draw closer. us surveillance has shown a growing number of improvised explosive devices, bombs, tunnels, trenches and firepits have been dug. the us also believes isis has put bombs on all the major bridges into the city, one official said.       us builds working theory on cause of syrian airstrike

__label__0 (cnn)interviewed monday on fox news channel's "fox and friends," donald trump, the republican presidential nominee, declared that americans have traveled overseas, fought for isis and returned with impunity.  "we have people going over, fighting for isis and coming back, and we know they are fighting for isis, and we take them," he said. "once you leave this country, you fight for isis, you never come back."  is that really true that they come back and let loose? in a word - no.  new america, a washington-based think tank, has used public records and news accounts to track americans who have aided isis. according to its analysis, 117 people in the us have attempted to join isis or other terrorist groups in syria, have made it there to fight, or have helped other join these organizations. according to new america's report, 74 of those were arrested before reaching syria. forty-three managed to reach that country and join the fight. of those, 17 were killed and 8 were arrested when they returned home.  "any american who has traveled to fight with a designated foreign terrorist organization and returned here would be subject to prosecution," said justice department spokesman, marc ramondi.  one person, moner abusalha of florida, did train with the al-qaeda affiliated group, the al-nusra front, and did return undetected to the us. but rather than stage any attacks on us soil, abusalha returned to syria after unsuccessfully trying to recruit more fighters here. he was later killed.  there is no evidence for trump's claim that us officials have allowed americans who fought with terrorist groups in syria to escape punishment when they returned home.        reality check: trump wrong on us taking back returning isis fighters      
__label__0 washington (cnn)six days before the crucial first presidential debate, donald trump is using a spate of bombings and stabbings to build an interlocking argument on two issues where he thinks tough talk gives him a winning hand -- immigration and terrorism. the attacks over the weekend mercifully did not kill anybody -- but they inevitably put the fear of terrorism back at the center of the showdown between trump and democratic nominee hillary clinton. from trump's point of view, the new terror scares play directly into a vision of a nation under siege and which he must get americans to buy into if he is to win in november. "we cannot let this evil continue," trump said in florida on monday after the capture of a us naturalized citizen of afghan descent suspected of planting a series of bombs in new york and new jersey over the weekend, and the stabbing of nine people in a separate attack in a minnesota mall on saturday in an attack claimed by isis. "if you chose donald trump, these problems are going to go away." still -- trump's hard bore approach does carry risks. his democratic rival hillary clinton is also maneuvering in the wake of the attacks, portraying herself as the kind of steely and calm commander-in-chief americans traditionally turn to in times of crisis. "i know how to do this," clinton said at an airport news conference on monday. trump is presenting the attacks as the result of what he says are lax, weak anti-terrorism policies pursued by president barack obama and his democratic foe clinton while she was secretary of state. and he's offering a solution: that the new threat of homegrown islamic terrorism could be snuffed out if only the united states adopted the kind of "extreme" vetting of foreigners and drastic changes to the immigration system that he proposed and which lit a fire under his presidential campaign. "hillary clinton's decisions overseas have left us with the threat we face today and her immigration policies will invite this threat onto our shores, and it's already happening," trump said monday. "let me state very clearly, immigration security is national security." trump is also likely to seize on the fact that ahmad khan rahami, the accused new york bomber, a us naturalized citizen of afghan descent, had spent time in afghanistan and pakistan in recent years to renew his call for a halt on immigration to the us from nations with proven links to terrorism. though trump's plans might not have prevented rahami from visiting south asia, where thousands of law abiding us citizens travel every month, rahami's travels will play into the febrile political atmosphere that trump is trying to tap into following the attacks. and revelations monday that at least 858 people that had been ordered deported or removed under another name were improperly granted us citizenship due to a failure to maintain adequate fingerprint records, according to a new report, will be used by critics of the immigration system to bolster his claims of the need for reform. trump's tough response to the terror attacks is likely to be a hit with his faithful supporters who have responded to such a message before -- for instance after attacks in paris, san bernardino california and orlando which helped to shape the republican primary process. but it's a gamble because while some americans like the tough talk, he risks exacerbating impressions that with his vehement response to terrorist attacks, he is exhibiting the deficiencies that have many other voters wondering whether he is fit to be president. it's also unclear whether the limited human toll of the weekend's attacks will dilute their impact on an election still 49 days away -- in an election season in which the narrative often seems to shift by the hour. for instance, the huge campaign controversies of recent days -- trump's false claim that clinton was to blame for accusations that obama was not born in the united states and the democratic nominee's health issues dominated campaign conversation for days last week -- but barely got a mention on monday. voters also appear conflicted on the how national security will factor into the election. a cnn/orc poll this month showed that voters trust the republican more to tackle terrorism, by 51% to 45%. but the same survey found that voters think clinton has the superior temperament required of a president (56% to 36%) and is better able to handle the responsibilities of commander in chief (50% to 45%). trump's potential temperamental vulnerability came into focus during his florida rally, when he bemoaned the medical treatment offered to rahami after he was injured in a shootout with police. "he will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. he will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. and he will probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. and on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer," trump said. but new york gov. andrew cuomo, a clinton supporter, pointed out that what trump was proposing was a wholesale repudiation of the humanitarian, civic and legal values for which the us stands -- a factor that could give some voters pause when they consider handing the white house to trump." "welcome to america," cuomo told cnn's wolf blitzer. "we have a system of jurisprudence, you are innocent until you proven guilty, you have a right to counsel, you have a right to hospitalization if you are ill. that is our system and it's what makes this country special. and what makes this country great." the clinton campaign, for its part, has long believed that in the unwanted circumstances of an "october surprise" terror attack, voters would turn to experience and a steady hand rather than trump's more impulsive leadership. "i have sat at that table in the situation room, i have analyzed the threats, i have contributed to actions that have neutralized our enemies. i know how to do this," clinton said during her news conference. while trump responded to the fears of americans, clinton issued a call to their intellect. "we should also launch an intelligence surge to help identify and thwart attacks before they can be carried out. we need to work more closely with silicon valley and other partners to counter terrorist propaganda and recruitment efforts online," clinton said, repeating policies she has long embraced.       national security moves to the top of 2016 campaign      
__label__0 washington (cnn)a group of former national security officials and experts are calling on donald trump to disclose his overseas business dealings, questioning whether the republican nominee has conflicts of interest with us foreign policy. more than 50 past officials signed the letter released monday, a mix of democratic and republican national security leaders. the letter notes that trump's business dealings overseas could pose "unprecedented" and "significant conflicts of interest" if he guided us foreign policy. it demands trump disclose in full what his foreign business interests are, and to promise to divest himself of them if he wins in november. global leaders meet at un "our next commander-in-chief will inherit complex national security threats and complicated relationships with allies and adversaries alike," the officials wrote. "but our policies must be motivated exclusively by what is in america's best interest, not by the financial interests of our president. the onus is on donald trump to assure voters that this will be the case by disclosing the nature of his overseas relationships and committing to divest such assets." signatories include hillary clinton supporters like retired gen. john allen and former defense undersecretary for policy michele flournoy. also signing were a number of former george w. bush administration officials, including former homeland security secretary michael chertoff, former deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz, former national security adviser robert blackwill, former deputy director of national intelligence for analysis thomas fingar and former acting cia director john e. mclaughlin. the letter shares some overlap with a missive from a group of 50 gop national security officials who last month wrote a letter opposing the republican candidate. 50 gop national security officials oppose trump trump has refused to release his tax returns, saying they are under audit, and has given limited information about his businesses to the public. he has said he will separate himself from the business if he became president, leaving it in charge of his children. but experts tell cnn putting his children in charge would not do enough to minimize potential conflicts of interest. trump has more than a dozen properties all over the world. the letter was first reported by the new york times. the trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.       past national security officials to trump: disclose foreign interests      
__label__0 atlanta (cnn)long before new jersey gov. chris christie ran for president, and later transformed into one of republican nominee donald trump's main supporters on the 2016 campaign trail, he was mired in a political scandal that left its mark on his career: bridgegate. it's been a few years since the brouhaha over the george washington bridge's lane closures rocked the christie administration. now, after three years of federal investigations, a couple of indictments and jury selection, the trial of a former aide of new jersey's governor and one of his longtime political allies will begin this morning in federal court. though christie himself has not faced any charges related to this incident -- he's denied all involvement from the onset -- he's expected to remain a key figure in the trial, unable to fully escape scrutiny from a controversy that's overshadowed his second and final term as governor. on monday, prosecutors said christie knew of the road closures while they were happening. the allegations came during opening arguments in the case involving bill baroni, deputy executive director of the port authority, and bridget kelly, christie's former deputy chief of staff. in case you forget how bridgegate all went down -- and what's at stake in the coming weeks -- here's an explanation of how we got to this point. so, what's bridgegate again? in november 2013, christie won re-election to his second and final gubernatorial term (he's term limited), cruising to a decisive victory fueled in part by his strong showing of leadership in the wake of hurricane sandy. despite his popularity at the time, not everyone endorsed the republican, who needed bipartisan backing in a blue state. mark sokolich, the democratic mayor of fort lee, was among the politicians who didn't support the incumbent governor. the following september, on the first day of the school year, port authority officials abruptly shut down some of the traffic lanes on the new jersey side of the george washington bridge, drawing the ire of motorists. initially, christie's administration characterized the closures as a part of a traffic study. later on, though, port authority officials testified that no such study ever happened. one month before the lane closure, with christie's re-election campaign in full swing, and kelly texted david wildstein, a former port authority official and a political ally of christie: "time for some traffic problems in fort lee." "got it," wildstein replied. the messages, contrary to the christie administration's spin that chalked it up to ineffective bureaucracy, offered evidence that the closures were an act of political vengeance, according to federal prosecutors. "they agreed to and did use public resources to carry out a vendetta and exact retribution," us attorney for new jersey paul fishman said in may 2015. who was charged in bridgegate? bill baroni, deputy executive director of the port authority and kelly were indicted on numerous conspiracy and fraud charges in may 2015. wildstein avoided trial by pleading guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation. the bridgegate charges stem from a series of damning emails and texts made public in january 2014. in response to the charges, kelly chalked up her correspondence with wildstein to "sarcasm and humor." then, she lambasted wildstein for lying about her involvement in order to get himself a plea deal. what about christie? those facing charges had clear and direct ties to christie. however, the governor has not faced charges and he has maintained he had no knowledge of the lane closures, denying any wrongdoing. shortly after the texts surfaced, christie fired kelly, noting that he felt "embarrassed and humiliated" by the "abject stupidity" of her actions. two months after those emails went public, lawyers retained by christie's office released a bridgegate report that exonerated christie. "it's a search for the truth and we believe we have gotten to the truth," former federal prosecutor randy mastro, whose law firm produced the bridgegate report, told nj.com in 2014 upon its release. "what we found was gov. christie had no involvement in the decision to close these lanes, and no prior knowledge of it." will the governor testify at the bridgegate trial? it remains to be seen whether christie will be subpoenaed. in an interview with cnn's jake tapper sunday, the governor said he would have "no problem" testifying if called upon. however, he didn't think he would be called he has "no knowledge of this incident at all." "of course, i will," christie told cnn. "i've been more open about this than anybody in public life. i've been investigated by three public entities, two of them led by partisan democrats who have all found that i had no knowledge of this incident and no involvement." it's unclear what the developments from monday's court date, and prosecutors saying that christie was aware of bridgecate, means for the possibility that the governor will testify. even if christie doesn't take the witness stand, the governor will likely remain front and center in the federal trial. last month, a former christie staffer, who worked underneath kelly, claimed that he "flat out lied" about his staff's involvement in bridgegate during a december 2013 news conference. what's at stake for the defendants? if a jury finds baroni and kelly guilty, they each could face prison time for their involvement in bridgegate. fishman, the federal prosecutor in the case, told the new york times at the time of the indictment that baroni and kelly each face a maximum sentence of 86 years. it was more likely that baroni and kelly would receive up to three years behind bars if convicted, fishman added. of course, they could also leave the court as free people, should a jury clear them of all charges. as for christie, who trump has said would head his transition team, the bridgegate trial has the potential to drag him through the mud — if not in a court facing a trial before his peers, then in the court of public opinion.       bridgegate trial: what to know      
__label__0 washington (cnn)at least 858 people that had been ordered deported or removed under another name were improperly granted us citizenship due to a failure to maintain adequate fingerprint records, according to a new report. the failure occurred, in part, because older fingerprint records were not digitized as part of dhs or the fbi fingerprint databases and therefore could not be readily searched thereby preventing those who had been ordered deported or removed from being identified. the department of homeland security inspector general report said there are still "about 148,000 older fingerprint records that have not been digitized of aliens with final deportation orders or who are criminals or fugitives." failure to digitize these records risks "making naturalization decisions without complete information and, as a result, naturalizing additional individuals who may be ineligible for citizenship or who may be trying to obtain us citizenship fraudulently," the report added. "us citizenship and immigration services granted us citizenship to at least 858 individuals from special interest countries who had been ordered deported or removed under another name," according to the department of homeland security inspector general report. the report describes special interest countries as "generally defined as countries that are of concern to the national security of the united states." at least one of the people identified as having improperly been granted citizenship is now working in law enforcement, the report said. it recommends the remaining older fingerprint records be digitized and that dhs review "the eligibility of each naturalized citizen whose fingerprint records reveal deportation orders under a different identity" and decide whether to seek denaturalization. the report noted that the department has concurred with its recommendations and has begun implementing corrective actions. department of homeland security spokesperson neema hakim told cnn that "dhs is and has been taking steps to address this issue" including working to digitize the 1990s-era fingerprint records. but hakim added, "the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently." "where the dhs review process finds that naturalization was obtained fraudulently, dhs will appropriately refer the case to the department of justice for civil or criminal proceedings, including for denaturalization," hakim said. "this failure represents a significant risk to america's national security as these naturalized individuals have access to serve in positions of public trust and the ability to obtain security clearances," republican sen. ron johnson of wisconsin, the chairman of the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee, wrote in an open letter to secretary of homeland security jeh johnson. failure to properly screen applicants for us citizenship, particularly from "special interest countries," is likely to further fuel controversy over the screening of immigrants, a contentious topic during the 2016 election cycle. republican presidential nominee donald trump has called for immigration bans targeted at countries with connections to terrorism. he had previously called for a temporary prohibition of muslim immigrants. the apprehension of ahmad khan rahami, the suspected perpetrator of the recent bombings in new york and new jersey, is similarly likely to draw attention to the screening process as rahami immigrated to the us from afghanistan and subsequently was granted us citizenship.       dhs report: more than 800 people wrongly given us citizenship

__label__0 washington (cnn)new york gov. andrew cuomo said tuesday that republican presidential candidate donald trump is wrong to suggest that the new york bombing suspect shouldn't receive medical care. "i understand the anger that donald trump is speaking to (but) this is america and this is our system and you are innocent until proven guilty and you have a right to counsel and that is the constitution of the united states of america," he said on cnn's "new day." "and that's what makes us who we are. that's what makes us special. and if you give that up, alisyn, then you have defeated yourself," cuomo, a democrat who has endorsed hillary clinton for president this cycle, told cnn's alisyn camerota. "that is the code of democracy and freedom. that is what they resent about us. so don't lose your soul in the process. because that is the soul of america." trump complained monday about ahmad khan rahami being offered medical treatment and legal assistance following his shootout with police. rahami, the suspect in saturday's bombings in new york and new jersey, was captured monday. following a frantic manhunt and shootout, rahami was shot multiple times before being taken to a hospital for surgery. "he will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. he will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. and he will probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. and on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer," trump said at a florida rally. but cuomo said tuesday that leaving a wounded rahami "on the streets" would have been un-american. "that's not who we are. that's not who we want to be. and that's not how we defeat the terrorists. we defeat the terrorists by staying true to who we are," he said. cuomo also responded on cnn's "the situation room" to trump's claim monday that rahami would have access to "amazing hospitalization" and be "taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world." "welcome to america," he told cnn's wolf blitzer. "right? we have a system of jurisprudence. you are innocent until proven guilty. you have a right to counsel ... that is our system. and it's what makes this country special. it's what make this country great." cuomo praised law enforcement tuesday for successfully capturing rahami quickly. "it was really a remarkable situation when you think about it," he said on "new day." "i think it's a statement of the time. we have gotten so sophisticated in law enforcement, especially in new york." on monday, cuomo disputed trump's assertion that police aren't doing their job because they are afraid of being accused of racial profiling. "our local police -- they know who a lot of these people are. they are afraid to do anything about it because they don't want to be accused of profiling," trump said fox news. cuomo responded: "i don't know how you could have been more aggressive than we were here." trump defends racial profiling in wake of bombs "i said as soon it as it happened that justice would be swift," he told blitzer. "i don't know how you can criticize that police activity. look at the product, look at the result, look at how aggressive it was."       gov. andrew cuomo defends providing medical care for bombing suspect

__label__1 in the past 3 or 4 days, the old obama “birther claims” are again making headlines. this time is that candidate donald trump is attempting to close the door on it by saying that barack benito milhous hussein obama (ht: mark levin) was born in the united states – period. you know it – the claim that obama was born in kenya and therefore not eligible to be president – the claim that was first implicitly floated by the hillary clinton campaign in 2007 and 2008. yes, that one. it wasn’t donald trump who originally fired up the birther train. he just took it to ridiculous heights. it was actually a political stunt by hillary clinton’s chief strategist mark penn who wrote in 2007: “his [obama] roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited. i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and his values.” penn also suggested how the campaign might take advantage of this. “every speech should contain the line that you [hillary] were born in the middle of america to the middle class in the middle of the last century,” he advised clinton. “and talk about the basic bargain as about [sic] the deeply american values you grew up with, learned as a child, and that drive you today.” he went on: “let’s explicitly own ‘american’ in our programs, the speeches and the values. he doesn’t … let’s add flag symbols to the backgrounds [of campaign events].” so they’ve chosen the one straw man they can go to war against. a topic so utterly pointless at this time, the only question to be asked is – what is the point? almost eight years into obama’s reign and it’s being brought up again. there is no point, other than as a distraction – which is the point. anything to get clinton out of the… read the rest of the story at www.ipatriot.com  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      why are the obama “birther claims” making headlines again?

__label__1 in 2004 president george w. bush ran a hard-fought reelection campaign against a popular, if doofy, democrat opponent john kerry. for all of his faults, kerry was far more well-liked and far less scandal plagued than today’s democrat candidate. bush was able to eke out a reelection victory mostly on the shoulders of his decisive reaction to the 9/11 tragedy. in fact, the 2004 election made the phrase “security moms” famous, as the once known “soccer mom” had suddenly awakened to our dangerous new world where islamic terrorism was the reality and her “mama bear” instincts had taken over. the “security mom” knew she had to do all she could to care for her loved ones, and that now meant using her vote to keep them safe. fast forward 12 years to the 2016 presidential election and the new generation of “security moms” will soon be playing a pivotal role (again) in another national election. the 2016 version of these security minded voters seem to be preparing to hand the presidency to gop candidate donald trump, and the events of this past weekend explain why. on saturday morning a pipe bomb exploded just before the start of a 5k fun run in seaside park, new jersey. the event was called off and authorities swept the area finding two more unexploded devices. later that night, a pressure cooker bomb exploded in manhattan’s chelsea neighborhood, injuring 29 people and sending the city into a panic. shortly after the explosion authorities swept the surrounding neighborhood and found another unexploded device a few blocks away. come sunday morning, liberals and their friends in the media were busy condemning donald trump’s comments about the explosions being “bombs” and about the likelihood that we were witnessing a terrorist act. trump’s opponents were practically hyperventilating about his “rash” response and his “haste” to judgment, all while arguing that there was “no evidence” of a connection to islam or to terrorist organizations. then late sunday evening authorities arrested five “persons of interest” around the same time that 5 more bombs were being discovered in an elizabeth, new jersey train station. by early monday morning police had captured ahmad khan rahami, a naturalized american citizen of afghani descent, who was living in elizabeth, new jersey. rahami, it turns out, was a “known wolf” with ties to international muslim terrorism. by the time the east coast was waking up, liberals were beginning to realize that donald trump had been right all along… consider new york city mayor bill de blasio’s comments on sunday: absent a motivation, mr. de blasio suggested the word terrorism should not be used, shaking his head in disapproval at the notion that the basic facts of the bombing could be described that way. “here is what we know: it was intentional, it was a violent act, it was certainly a criminal act, it was a bombing — that’s what we know,” he said on sunday, flanked by law enforcement officials at police headquarters in lower manhattan. “to understand there were any specific motivations, political motivations, any connection to an organization — that’s what we don’t know.” the liberal reticence at calling terrorism terrorism never ceases to amaze me. it’s as though de blasio believes that if you say the word terrorism you automatically mean that a muslim person has carried out a violent act. taking his own words – “it was intentional, it was a violent act, it was certainly a criminal act, it was a bombing…” this is the very definition of terrorism. it’s an act meant to incite a reaction. the only reason anyone would ever set off a bomb without some other concurring criminal act (like using a bomb to rob a bank), would be for terroristic purposes. yet, de blasio couldn’t bring himself to use the word and instead just described the act of terrorism to reporters. even new york’s liberal governor andrew cuomo (d-ny), who was slow to call the act terrorism on saturday, had changed his tune by sunday. “a bomb exploding in new york is obviously an act of terrorism. a bomb going off is generically a terrorist activity.” but by monday de blasio’s tune finally changed. “we have reason to believe this was an act of terror,” new york mayor bill de blasio said. a-duh. here’s a newsflash, bill… every other thinking person in america has already come to this conclusion. thanks for joining us. meanwhile, while de blasio was busy dissembling, hillary clinton was busy using the terrorism to attack donald trump for being to hard on terrorism. i kid you not. clinton’s argument is that donald trump’s mean words are going to make the terrorists dislike us even more, so they’re going to do more terroristy things. “i don’t want to speculate but here’s what we know about i think it is important for voters to hear this and weigh it in making their choice in november,” clinton said. “we know that a lot of the rhetoric used by donald trump is being seized upon by terrorists.“ clinton says trump’s rhetoric has “given aid and comfort” to terrorists. phrase is definition of treason. — zeke miller (@zekejmiller) september 19, 2016  this is an amazing argument to make, considering that the obama/clinton foreign policy era has been one of appeasement and uber-careful rhetoric (when it comes to islam) and yet, islamic terrorism is worse today than ever before! ultimately, it won’t be the cavalcade of corruption, or the litany of scandals, or the lies, or her obviously failing health that ends hillary clinton’s hopes of being president. no, it will be the glaring differences between clinton and trump on dealing with the very real threat we face from islamic terrorism. more americans will decide that to continue the obama/clinton policy of appeasement and apology would be insanity, and that america would be safer handing the reins of leadership to donald trump. the liberal response to this weekend’s terrorism is why donald trump will be elected the next president of the united states, and it’s why the terrorist supporters at cair and the muslim brotherhood are so worried. reposted with permission from constitution.com   the views expressed in

__label__1 according to homeland security’s inspector general, at least 858 immigrants from foreign countries that pose national security risks, as well as those from countries with high immigration fraud who had orders to have them deported were “mistakenly” granted citizenship. an internal homeland security audit was released monday, which documented the “mistake.” the associated press reports: the report does not identify any of the immigrants by name, but inspector general john roth’s auditors said they were all from “special interest countries” — those that present a national security concern for the united states — or neighboring countries with high rates of immigration fraud. the report did not identify those countries. dhs said the findings reflect what has long been a problem for immigration officials — old paper-based records containing fingerprint information that can’t be searched electronically. dhs says immigration officials are in the process of uploading these files and that officials will review “every file” identified as a case of possible fraud. the gap was created because older, paper records were never added to fingerprint databases created by both the now-defunct immigration and naturalization service and the fbi in the 1990s. ice, the dhs agency responsible for finding and deporting immigrants living in the country illegally, didn’t consistently add digital fingerprint records of immigrants whom agents encountered until 2010. and this is what happens when government puts its nose in things like healthcare and other unconstitutional things it usurps its authority to meddle in. if the central government had been focused only on the things it is authorized to deal with, this matter would more than likely never have occurred. not only that, but you can rest assured that no one will be held accountable in the matter. while dhs is blaming paper issues and fingerprints, there were some of those who were awarded citizenship that were set to be deported. while chairman of the house homeland security committee michael mccaul called on ice to have all immigration fingerprints digitized, but the threat to national security is great since citizens can apply and obtain security clearances or take jobs which are security sensitive. according to roth, at least three of these new citizens acquired aviation or transportation worker credentials, granting them access to secure areas in airports or maritime facilities and vessels. he went on to state that their credentials were revoked once it was discovered that they had been given citizenship mistakenly. he also said that another individual had been given the role of a law enforcement officer. while changes were recommended and dhs agreed with them and said they would work to implement them, this problem has been going on for years. according to the ap report, “the government has known about the information gap and its impact on naturalization decisions since at least 2008 when a customs and border protection official identified 206 immigrants who used a different name or other biographical information to gain citizenship or other immigration benefits, though few cases have been investigated.” what has really been done about it? nothing. are we really to expect something new?  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      858 immigrants granted citizenship…by “mistake”

__label__1 from the daily caller news foundation: former president bill clinton and his clinton health access initiative (chai) distributed “watered-down” hiv/aids drugs to patients in sub-saharan africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by the daily caller news foundation. the congressional report, titled,“the clinton foundation and the india success story,” was initiated by rep. marsha blackburn, a tennessee republican and vice-chair of the house energy and commerce committee. the chai program to help aids victims is considered one of the clinton foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. the congressional report focused on clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial indian drug manufacturer called ranbaxy, which chai used as one of its main distributors of hiv/aids drugs to third world countries. it also highlighted the work of dinesh thakur, a former ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the u.s. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the indian firm. the company was vulnerable to u.s. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the u.s. market. ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. the department of justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company. “this is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the district of maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said u.s. attorney for the district of maryland rod j. rosenstein when ranbaxy pleaded guilty. “when companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the fda’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said stuart f. delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the department of justice, when the government announced its action against the indian company. the department of justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report. “the question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked blackburn in an interview with thedcnf. the possibility that chai distributed adulterated and diluted aids drugs to third world victims could shake the foundations of the clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate hillary clinton’s campaign. blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the department of health and human services and to the department of state, where hillary served as secretary of state during president barack obama’s first term. the congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between bill and two controversial indian-americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the food and drug administration (fda) and the securities and exchange commission. the most troubling revelations concern the clinton foundation’s vigorous promotion of ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the fda. it is unclear at this juncture how many aids patients received the “watered-down” drugs. propublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the u.s. agency for international development allocated $9 million to ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “substandard hiv medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from hiv-related infections,” roger bate, an economist at the american enterprise institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told thedcnf. thakur told thedcnf that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in aids patients. “these drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. if the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the wbc levels stabilize,” he said. ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in august 2004, one year after chai began working with the firm. the world health organization reported irregularities involving three ranbaxy drugs in south africa, according to the report. the fda sent a public “warning letter” to ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. it concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral hiv/aids medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.” although ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the u.s., chai and the former president continue to praise ranbaxy and distribute the company’s hiv/aid drugs to patients abroad. bill heaped praise on ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives. neither chai nor the clinton foundation have announced they severed ties with ranbaxy. thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients. the whistleblower tried to meet with chai and clinton foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “i have tried to reach out to them,” he told thedcnf. “but i haven’t had a great amount of success with the clinton foundation.” chai was a part of the clinton foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. the groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. bill clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations. charles ortel, a wall street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the clinton foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.” “in the application, trustees of the new entity, including bill clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. this is not true. they purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘chai’ was by far the largest piece of the original foundation,” ortel told thedcnf. the congressional study suggests bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order. he signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the u.s. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘sub-saharan country’ relating to hiv/aids medicines or technologies,” the report states. chai announced in october 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost hiv drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers:  ranbaxy; cipla of mumbai, india; matrix labs of hydrabad, india; aspen pharmacare of johannesburg, south africa. chai’s endorsement also allowed ranbaxy to manufacture hiv drugs that would be bought by the u.s. government under the president’s emergency plan for aids relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former president george w. bush. the flow of u.s. funds combined with clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study. ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the fda, according to the congressional study. eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic hiv drugs. the companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the foundation for several years,” the report states. the study also examined the key players in the clinton-chai orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the clinton foundation in terms of donor contributions. one relationship unearthed by the report was the american indian foundation, which clinton co-founded with indian-american businessmen rajat gupta and vinod gupta in 2001. rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial. vinod eventually was forced to resign as ceo and chairman of the company infogroup and was fined $9 million in a securities and exchange commission investigation. one of the charges stated vinod had awarded bill $3.3 million without board approval. blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the clinton foundation. “you think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. to me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she

__label__1 on monday, donald trump gave a speech in estero, florida that focused on the latest terrorist attacks in new york, new jersey and minnesota. he used it to give a blistering indictment of president obama and former secretary of state hillary clinton for their feckless handling of the middle east and islamic terrorism in general-which they are unable or unwilling to even name. as usual, the clinton-obama conglomeration (for lack of a better word) came out with their typically vanilla response to the above terrorist attacks. white house spokesman josh earnest came out with yet another boffo explanation that we are in a “war of narratives with isis.” clinton stated on sunday that it would be wise not to speak out before all the facts were in (i am paraphrasing), and that we needed to “steel our resolve” whatever that means. then on monday she stated that  trump’s rhetoric was giving aid and comfort to the enemy, a form of treason, no less. “donald trump is being used as a recruiting sergeant for isis,” clinton said on monday morning. “the kind of language and rhetoric trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries.”  yes, hillary. all these atrocities are happening because of trump’s rhetoric. there is no doubt that trump is going to at least give us a feel for how he is going to battle islamic terror. he already has given us some in his references to limiting muslim immigration. now that he has “modified” it by talking about “extreme vetting,” clinton has jumped on the bandwagon saying that she has always supported enhanced vetting – this as she actively supports a dramatic increase in syrian refugees – over five times as many as obama’s 10,000. trump, for his part, while not telegraphing our moves to the enemy, needs to let us know something about his military intentions. my sense is that he will try to bring nato and our arab allies together into a fighting force that will go into syria, iraq and libya to destroy the isis army in the air and on the ground. that done, it is up to the west to take whatever steps we can to keep isis terrorists out of our lands. it goes without saying that our immigration policies must be drastically revised. (in europe, it may be too late.) i truly think that the majority of the american people – while not wanting to massively violate the rights of american muslims – are not happy with our government’s responses to islamic terror, even more so as we are attacked on our own soil. hillary clinton plainly promises more of the same if elected. they know that islamic terrorists are at war with us and intend to carry out that war on our own streets. while not painting all muslims with the same brush, it is clear to all that terrorists are walking among us. we know that future attacks are being planned as we speak. by various estimates, the current muslim population in the us is around 1%. that amounts to a few million people, who are immigrants, naturalized american citizens, or younger people actually born here. forget about mass roundups, deportations or internments. we can adopt a zero-tolerance policy for non-citizens who violate our laws and kick them out, but by and large, it will be up to law enforcement and the courts to remove the terrorists and plotters from our midst. in the meantime, that 1%  must not be allowed to grow. if we are having these problems at 1%, what do you think it will be like at 5% or 10% or higher? far beyond a religion, this is a political ideology that is incompatible with our constitution – a belief system, if you will. we once kept communists from entering the us based on their belief system, which would have subverted our democracy.  we need to find a way to do it again – if for no other reason than to protect our citizens from harm. trump wants to find a way to accomplish that. if trump handles this issue sensibly, it can be a winner for him. without castigating an entire community, all he has to do is talk about hillary’s failures and reluctance to go beyond what she and obama have already done (or not done) in responding to islamic terror – which they won’t even name. however, he also has to convince us he has a concrete plan to destroy isis and protect the american people.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      hillary clinton: “donald trump is being used as a recruiting sergeant for isis”      
__label__1   after collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in new york city, hillary clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the hillary at chelsea clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. the nose on the hillary clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of hillary in the past. the different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real hillary clinton has what is known as the nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. the clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a roman type. aside from the different nose types, the clone hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, hillary clinton does. since the real hillary clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those bill clinton will do himself. the question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with donald trump that are coming up? or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates? what we need to look for immediately is her appearance. if she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real hillary clinton. if she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not hillary clinton. the biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real hillary clinton ever be seen or heard as president of the united states? or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, state of the union addresses, and speeches? it could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the swearing in. it is a very big possibility that the real hillary clinton may not even play a part of a new clinton administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity. if anyone thought president obama may not be who he claims he is, such a clinton administration being conducted entirely without hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about obama seem inconsequential. the american people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in barack h obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as president. hillary clinton may be the first administration in us history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      a hillary clinton administration may be entirely run by a figurehead      
__label__1 never has the “rights for me, but not for thee” idea been more apparent than in the context of gun control. politicians love to parade around with families of mass shooting victims, particularly if those victims were schoolchildren. they talk about how no one needs ten bullets to kill a deer, and they talk about how semi-automatic rifles – especially the black ones – serve no purpose other than to kill a bunch of people in a short amount of time. the only kind of gun they don’t seem to have a problem with is a shotgun, as long as it’s one that holds no more than two rounds at a time. while these same politicians use shooting victims to push their anti-gun ideas, everyone knows that they are surrounded by armed  bodyguards. yes, armed with evil guns. donald trump brought this up at a campaign rally in miami, florida. he said: “she’s very much against the second amendment. she wants to destroy your second amendment. guns, guns, guns, right? i think what we should do is – she goes around with armed bodyguards, like you have never seen before. i think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons. they should disarm, right? right? i think they should disarm immediately. what do you think? yes? take their guns away! she doesn’t want guns. let’s see what happens to her. it would be very dangerous.”  every gun control politician benefits from the second amendment. the high-profile ones surround themselves with security personnel who carry firearms. they know that having armed security around them protects them. but they don’t want everyday americans to be afforded the same right. for now, maybe these gun control politicians would say that they’d be okay if americans had a shotgun at home, as long as that gun was locked up in a safe and completely disassembled, and the ammo was in an entirely different safe on the other side of the house.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      trump challenges hillary to disarm her bodyguards: “see what happens to her!” [video]      
__label__1 it was only a matter of time before the military would start reeducating servicemen (or is it “servicepeople?”) about how to behave around others who are born with one set of sex organs but “identify” as a member of the opposite sex. all troops will be required to be trained in how to behave around transgender people by july of 2017, coinciding with the date that the navy will begin accepting transgender recruits. military.com reported: in an all-navy message published tuesday, chief of naval personnel vice adm. robert burke said a three-pronged training approach will equip senior leaders and rank-and-file personnel for the changes. “this training will emphasize policies and expectations of personal behavior,” the message states. beginning nov. 1, mobile training teams composed of navy fleet representatives and subject matter expects will be dispatched to deliver face-to-face briefs to senior leaders, including commanding officers, executive officers, command master chiefs, and chiefs of boat. these sessions will also be open to equal opportunity advisers, ombudsmen and other command-designated representatives who will have a role in training the tenant commands on policies governing transgender troops. along with permitting transgender troops to serve openly, the military is creating procedures for troops to change their “gender marker” in the administrative defense enrollment eligibility reporting system, and laying out rules to govern how troops might undergo medical gender transitions while in uniform. transgender troops will be required to use the bathroom and berthing facilities associated with their preferred gender, navy officials have said. and service leaders will be on alert for those who seek to single out or mistreat their transgender counterparts. the military times reported that transgender troops are now eligible to receive sex-reassignment surgery paid for by the pentagon (taxpayers) as long as they’re active-duty, and there is approval from their doctors and military health officials. the surgical procedure to rearrange the active duty military member’s genitals to vaguely resemble those of the opposite sex can be performed at a military hospital, or if it’s not available at the time – or if there’s a long wait time – tricare will cover it at a private hospital.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      navy to begin mandatory transgender behavioral education      
__label__1 there’s a reason far-left, progressive whack job senator elizabeth warren was given the nickname fauxcohantas. she’s as phony as a $3 bill. warren earned that nickname after it was discovered that she lied for years about being part native american, then when confronted, she touted her “pow pow’s” high cheekbones as evidence that he was native american. she rails against wall street when she has made millions because of wall street. warren went after donald trump when it was reported that he made money flipping houses without disclosing that she has done the same. we should be used to warren’s feigning outrage because she does so when it is politically expedient. that leads to the senate hearing today in which warren grilled the ceo of wells fargo, john stumpf, over thousands of workers being caught setting up fake accounts in order to earn bonuses. wells fargo has since fired those workers and said that there could be more people let go if they discover further shenanigans. but that wasn’t enough for fauxcohantas. she had to get up on her hypocritical high horse when the cameras were running to score her political talking points. although the individuals who actually bilked the customers out of money were fired, warren has the audacity to chastise the wells fargo ceo because senior executives were not fired accusing him of “gutless leadership.” “you haven’t fired a single senior executive. instead, evidently, your definition of accountable is to push the blame to low-level employees who don’t have the money for a fancy pr firm to defend themselves. it’s gutless leadership.” where were these words from elizabeth warren when barack obama blamed low-level irs employees in cincinnati for the irs targeting, harassing, and intimidation of conservative and tea party groups? where were these tough words when it turned out people at the top not only knew what was going on but orchestrated it? where was fauxcohontas when lois lerner was able to retire with a cushy pension and faced absolutely no repercussions for her hand in the scandal. where was warren when obama lied to the american people in an interview with bill o’reilly before the super bowl when he said there wasn’t a smidgen of corruption? and did elizabeth warren demand that va executives who were keeping fake log books in order to get bonuses be fired? did she go on record of accusing barack obama of “gutless leadership” for his failure to fire anyone when it came to the va scandal or the irs scandal? did she say obama created the environment for such despicable practices to occur, practices which led to the death of hundreds of veterans and impact on the livelihood of americans who were simply practicing their first amendment rights in criticizing their government? no. elizabeth warren didn’t say a damn word about those things. why? because it would not have been politically expedient. yes, there’s a reason elizabeth warren was given the nickname “fauxcahontas.” she’s a big, filthy, hypocritical fake and political opportunist. that was exposed and made perfectly clear with her rant against the wells fargo ceo. watch elizabeth “fauxcahontas” warren in all her hypocritical glory.   email subscribe      the hardest-hitting political news.

__label__1 this may be the biggest endorsement that gop presidential candidate donald trump has gotten since the primary season ended. his biggest weakness with voters has long been his perceived lack of experience on foreign policy, which has been exacerbated by the foreign policy establishment’s general embrace of hillary clinton. while clinton likely plans to pursue many of barack obama’s failed policies abroad, she has generally toed the foreign policy line that the political establishment has been parroting for years. meanwhile, donald trump has taken a different tack on issues dealing with russia, china, the middle east, and latin america. these differences have made it difficult for him to find supporters in the foreign policy community that could help him reassure voters. that’s no longer a problem. former cia director r. james woolsey, who was appointed and served under president bill clinton, came out this week and announced that he would be joining the trump campaign and advising mr. trump on foreign policy. woolsey said that he could not support clinton because of her unwillingness to sacrifice her own self-interests and to safeguard our secrets. “she demonstrated a complete lack of understanding and an inability to lead the agency she headed in such a way as to maintain its mission and security,” woolsey said in a statement. “based on the emails thus far released we know that secretary clinton also lacks the ability to lead her senior managers while complying with and maintaining the basic protocols designed to protect our government’s sensitive and classified information. mr. trump understands the magnitude of the threats we face and is holding his cards close to the vest.”  later in an interview with cnn, woolsey cited trump’s ability to safeguard our secrets (better than clinton has) and his budget plans as reasons for throwing his support to mr. trump. “he seems to be, more so than his opponent, in favor of a strong defense budget. we’ve got a lot of space to make up and problems that have been left in defense by the obama administration.”  woolsey’s endorsement and advice may go a long way to helping trump close the foreign policy gap that he’s thus far encountered with hillary clinton. also, now that woolsey has joined the team, one wonders if other foreign policy experts will begin lining up with trump as well. with the debates around the corner, the trump team certainly seems to be getting their political affairs in order, which can’t be welcome news for the clinton campaign. reposted with permission from constitution.com  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      you won’t believe what bill clinton’s cia director said about trump [video]

help, here on earth, god’s work, must truly be our own.” despite his obvious moral failings in his private life, president kennedy’s personal ambitions were transcended by his belief that his primary duty in public life was to love his country and to serve her people. that said, we also know he was a democrat, and the last democrat to serve as president, whose efforts as chief executive were meant to build up america, rather than to tear america apart. following the tragic assassination of president kennedy on november 22, 1963, up to and including the present, there have been four more presidents from the democratic party: lyndon johnson, (1963-69); jimmie carter (1977-81); bill clinton (1993-2001); and barack obama, (2009-?). under their individual and collective brand of so-called leadership, the united states of america and her people have been steadily and systematically dismantled, fragmented, weakened, and mercilessly abused. during these past 50 years, thanks to the national democrats and the left-wing allies in congress, the white house and our federal court system, the national democratic party has become america’s largest and most powerful “hate group.” lyndon johnson, also known as “lbj” took america into the malicious morass of the vietnam war, and into the abyss of the equally malicious lie known as the “great society,” spending hundreds of billions of dollars on a vast system of socialist welfare spending that perpetuated poverty, especially in our cities and our minority communities, in a deliberate move to weaken the poor and less advantaged into federal dependency. at the same time, we fought an undeclared war in vietnam and southeast asia for a decade, resulting in more than 58,000 needless deaths in the u.s. military, only to lose the war and witness the humiliation of reunification of north and south vietnam into one communist nation. lbj partnered with another, degenerate member of the kennedy clan, ted kennedy, to engineer passage in 1965 of new immigration laws that started the stampede of mass legal and illegal immigration that eventually evolved into the “open borders” mess that brings in terrorists, america-haters and uneducated millions who promptly entered the social welfare system immediately upon arrival. james earl “jimmie” carter, sat fecklessly in a cardigan sweater by the fireplace one january evening and told americans that we were in a “malaise,” or more directly expressed, americans were in a foul mood, anxious and frustrated by both an economy in shambles with high unemployment and high inflation, as well as a foreign policy that created the conditions to begin the awakening of long simmering but dormant radical islam, with the takeover of the american embassy and the “triumphant” return from french exile of the ayatollah khomeini to iran and leadership in 1979. carter sat in a cardigan sweater and blamed americans for a mood of “malaise” that carter created. jimmie carter’s primary accomplishment in four years as president was the humiliation of america before the rest of the world, as well as his own place in history as having been humiliated personally in the eyes of the majority of americans. william jefferson “bill” clinton began his presidency on january 20, 1993 with his “gratuitous” attendance at the “gay and lesbian inaugural ball” in washington, beginning on day one of his presidency to repay the support in his election campaign of the lbgt lobby. soon after, clinton announced the rueful break with two centuries of military tradition and law by instituting the infamous “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy permitting gays to serve without fear of discharge. he put “hillary the horrible” clinton in charge of an ill-fated attempt to ram socialized medicine down the throats of the american people, and bill clinton, with the successful enactment of the north american free trade agreement or “nafta”, accelerated to “warp speed” the exodus of american businesses, jobs, and wealth to foreign nations such as mexico, that had begun in the 1970s. later in his presidency his womanizing caught up with him and, after having one or more sexual affairs in the white house, was impeached by congress, not for womanizing but for proceeding to lie to congress and lie to the entire nation by denying the sexual immoralities. three previous democratic presidents had succeeded in seriously damaging and weakening america, by the time the notorious barack hussein obama was elected and sworn in as the 44th president on january 20, 2009. his eight years in office have included the most reckless borrowing and spending of any administration in history. half our entire national debt ($10 billion of the $20 billion) was created in just the past eight years of obama’s tenure. yet mr. obama has absolutely nothing to show for all that reckless spending. the economy is in shambles, the infrastructure of highways, bridges, and public lands is crumbling, while the military forces and weaponry that must defend our nation is being systematically dismantled. meanwhile tens of millions of americans have been added to the already overwhelming financial burden in government through swollen welfare rolls, food stamps, forced early retirements, long term unemployment, and social security disability fraud. mr. obama, whose sworn duty along with congress under the constitution is to “promote the general welfare, has instead promote the welfare of every small minority and special interest groups imaginable, in response to their collective loud potty mouths, collective asinine demands, and their collective calls for elevation to privileged and special legal status of their immoral and degenerate agendas. mr. obama has used the “bully pulpit” leadership tradition begun by teddy roosevelt, not to uplift, inspire and unify, but instead to berate, lecture and divide americans. to barack obama, “(radical) black lives matter”; “gay and lesbian lives matter”; “radical muslim lives matter”; “illegal alien lives matter”; convicted criminals lives matter”; meanwhile, the lives of ordinary, law-abiding, responsible working americans, do not matter; the lives of christians, foreign and domestic, do not matter; the lives of american military servicemen and women do not matter; the lives of our veterans do not matter; the lives of the “thin blue line” of peace officers in our police and sheriff departments do not matter; and, with all certainty, the protections due to americans under our constitution and the bill of rights, in the mind of mr. obama, do not matter at all. in the half century since the assassination of john f. kennedy, under the presidency of the four democratic presidents that followed, as well as the years of democratic control of congress, and federal courts, the national democratic party has deliberately and with malice aforethought trampled on the general welfare of the decent, hardworking and law abiding majority in america, while trampling on our rights and wastefully expending our tax dollars, to pay false homage to dozens of undeserving but vocal and demanding minority special interest groups, to the severe detriment of the much earned and deserving general welfare of the vast majority of our nation’s citizens. the national democratic party has become nothing short of america’s most powerful “hate group.” the american left wing, socialists and democrats are the party that despises, attacks and works diligently and unceasingly to destroy all that is good within america. this “hate group” called the national democratic party demonizes: (1) law abiding morally upright american citizens; (2) unborn children; christians; (3) constitutional conservatives; (4) legal gun owners; (5) job-producing energy businesses in oil, gas and coal production; (6) rural and small town america; (7) the ranching and farming west, including the “horse culture “ of wild mustangs and ranchers; (8) small business owners; (9) our police and our military, including veterans; and (10) above all, the democratic party despises god, the bible, christianity and the ethical moral codes and common law inherent to judeo-christian foundations cited by the founding fathers 240 years ago. although the judeo-christian, moral and ethical, constitutional conservative american majority is clearly despised by the “hate group” called the democratic party, we the american majority do not hate, because jesus christ taught us that the greatest commandment of all is to love one another, and not to hate the sinner, but to instead only hate the sin. the vast majority of americans should, and indeed do, hate sin. however, the democratic party clearly despises us. to paraphrase john f. kennedy’s words from 1961; americans who are constitutional conservatives, christians and law abiding, ethical citizens must “help every friend, and oppose any foe.” we must love and support each other, but at the same time, we must band together and fight the left wing. we must fight the evil of barack obama and hillary clinton. we must fight the immorality of communism, fascism, radical lbgt groups, radical islam, collectivist socialism, radical atheism, and every foe of our constitution, bill of rights, and ronald reagan’s “shining city on the hill.” a famous aphorism states, “all that is required for evil to prevail is for good men and women to do nothing.” above all, therefore, righteous, conservative and patriotic americans must fight evil, so that the good may once again prevail in america in the historically prevailing form of “liberty, justice and virtue.”  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by

__label__1 from the daily caller news foundation: the man arrested monday in connection with the new york city bombing sued his local police force over anti-muslim discrimination claims. ahmad khan rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in elizabeth, n.j., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the chelsea neighborhood of manhattan, at a train station in elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k marine charity run on the jersey shore. he claimed police were persecuting him for being a muslim and subjecting him and his family to “selective enforcement” based on islam, reports the daily mail. rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called first american, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with “baseless” tickets, and that locals said: “muslims don’t belong here.” rahami brought the suit along with his father mohammad sr. and his brother mohammad. he was arrested following a shootout with police monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a new jersey bar.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      bombing suspect filed anti-muslim discrimination lawsuit against police

__label__1 a former mayor in the state of ohio has admitted to raping and molesting a little girl over a three year period, beginning when she was just 4 years old. however, what is more disturbing is the fact that he claims the child was a “willing participant” and initiated the acts. richard keenan, a former hubbard mayor, admitted to the crimes, according to the trumbull county prosecutor’s office. vindy.com reports: keenan, who served as hubbard mayor in 2010 and 2011, was indicted last month on eight counts of rape and 12 counts of attempted rape and gross sexual imposition. a rape conviction carries a sentence of life in prison. according to the filing by assistant prosecutor gabriel wildman, keenan, 65, made the admissions to his wife, a pastor, a social worker and his brother and sister-in-law. wildman’s filing states that when keenan’s wife, diana, heard about the assaults from the child, “upon confronting [her husband] about the allegations, [keenan] responded, ‘i did it.'” the filing states keenan also admitted sexual abuse during “group discussions” while he was in the valleycare trumbull memorial hospital psychiatric ward. keenan also had “in depth” conversations with his pastor in which he spoke of the molestation and rape. mr. keenan was also feeling suicidal because he had been abusing the child, according to a social worker from the warren psychiatric facility, which he voluntarily admitted himself. he also said that the child initiated the act and even referred to her as a “willing participant.” now, questions are being raised as to whether or not his wife and pastor are able to testify against him. the ohio rules of evidence state that a spouse is considered “competent to be a witness if the testifying spouse elects to testify.” additionally, the ohio revised coder says that the pastor cannot be compelled to testify if “the confession or confidential communication was made directly to the cleric.” keenan was indicted in august on eight counts of rape and twelve counts of attempted rape and gross sexual imposition. he is free on $75,000 bond. if convicted, he faces life in prison. his trial is scheduled to be held prior to april 24, 2017. i have to ask, what need is there for a trial? has the man not confessed to the crime? it is a waste of time and money. furthermore, what is with sentencing a man to life in prison? will his young victim not grow up to pay taxes to support food, clothing and housing for her rapist? what is just about that? we need a return to the biblical model of law and justice, a model our forefathers followed. reposted with permission from freedom outpost  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      democrat mayor rapes 4-year-old, blames her as “willing participant”

__label__1 the government’s answer to every failed program or ineffective federal department is to dump more taxpayer money in it. ever since government education has become the norm, kids are dumb and dumber. but big government advocates claim that the problem is that they just don’t have enough money. so, they throw more money at it, and the problems only get bigger. ever since the war on drugs was declared, we’ve spent over $1.5 trillion, and drug use remains unchanged or even worse. but instead of questioning the policy or considering the constitutionality of the issue, their answer is to throw more money at it, in hopes that they’ll finally stamp out illegal drug usage once and for all. but it only gets worse. the same is true with the “war on terror.” the u.s. government dumped $5 trillion into it, terrorism has increased by leaps and bounds. but instead of reevaluating our foreign policy – especially pertaining to the middle east – the politicians’ answer is to expand our foreign policy, and of course, throw more money at it. and terrorism continues to grow. from zero hedge: according to a report released by dr. neta crawford, professor of political science at brown university, spending by the united states departments of defense, state, homeland security, and veteran affairs since 9/11 is now close to $5 trillion usd. before we have the chance to ask how a country that has racked up over $19.3 trillion usd in debt can spend $5 trillion usd on war, the focus of this article is to ask: what has all of this spending achieved? as reader supported news reported at the end of last year, terrorism has increased 6,500 percent since 2002 (they probably should rename it “the war of terror”). in 2014, the outlet noted, it was reported that 74 percent of all terror-related casualties occurred in iraq, nigeria, afghanistan, pakistan, or syria. as stated by paul gottinger, a staff reporter for reader supported news, out of the aforementioned countries, “only nigeria did not experience either u.s. air strikes or a military occupation in that year.” omitted from that assessment is the fact that the u.s. has been meddling in nigeria for some time now. why wouldn’t they? until recently, nigeria was africa’s largest oil producer, as well as the continent’s largest economy until last month. and look at this shocker from ben swann: “before the 2003 u.s. invasion, do you know how many suicide attacks there were in iraq? none. in the country’s history there had never been one. but since the 2003 invasion, there have been 1,892. “in iraq, prior to the start of the iraq war, there were reportedly just over 1.5 million christians living in that country. and yet shortly after the war started, more than one million of them fled to syria. that didn’t work out well. today fewer than half a million christians remain and yet are being exterminated by groups like isis.” the more terrorism grows and is a threat to our national security, the more laws the u.s. government passes that not only continually erode away at our freedoms, but do nothing to protect us.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      u.s. spends $5 trillion on war on terror…terrorism increases by 6,500%      
__label__1 david brock is the founder of the left-wing media “watchdog” media matters for america. it has a stated goal of “comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the u.s. media.” brock is also the head of super pac in support of hillary clinton called correct the record. like media matters, correct the record seeks to monitor all conservative news and coverage of hillary clinton and attempt to “debunk” any criticism of her. since they’re also in the business of opposition research, they’re wanting to pay anyone to come forward with some embarrassing dirt on donald trump. as long as the dirt was “legally” obtained. they’re dubbing this project “trumpleaks.” the washington free beacon reported: brock asked for video or audio of trump that has yet to be released. “one of the most important things for voters to evaluate in any election is the full measure of a candidate’s views, ideas, and temperament over time,” the website states. “in making a choice for president, voters must also consider how various candidates present themselves to the public and to the world. there are few things more important in that regard than access to video or audio in the form of prior television or radio interviews or more candid video from events a candidate may have attended.” brock’s super pac goes on to say they can offer compensation to anyone who has new video or audio that has been obtained legally. “trumpleaks is an effort to uncover unreported video or audio of donald trump so voters can have access to the donald trump who existed before running for president and before his recent affinity for teleprompters,” the website says of the project. “trumpleaks can provide some compensation to those who have usable, undoctored video or audio that has been legally obtained or is legally accessible.” nbc news noted that the project is “highly unusual” and seems to “cross a new line” in modern day politics. i think the only way in which this is “crossing a new line” is that they’re so out in the open about it. this is how they get dirt on opponents. it’s just that a candidate’s super pac doesn’t usually make a public announcement about it. there’s got to be something out there that someone knows that will be damaging to donald trump. everyone’s got skeletons in their closet. i imagine that “trumpleaks” will get a hold of it and wait until the most opportune time to release it. if for nothing else, it does show how desperate hillary clinton and her surrogates are in trying to make a comeback. it shows that they’re concerned that they’re not going to win.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      trumpleaks: head of hillary super pac offers money for dirt on trump      
__label__1 back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-secretary of state hillary clinton and the clinton foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish white house state dinners – the clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years. i don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the clinton foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the clinton family and their well-connected friends. the foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. that way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good. the daily caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity: just 5.7 percent of the clinton foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s irs filings. the rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” the clinton foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s irs filings show. but less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. that number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851k was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the clinton foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. the foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014. sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. this was nothing more than a way for the clintons to make massive amounts of money. and hillary used her position as secretary of state to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.    the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      clinton foundation spent 5.7% on charity; rest went to “salaries” and “other expenses”      
__label__1 this is hot off the presses folks – something dangerous is going on in the new york city metro area. at around 12:40 am monday morning police were alerted to a suspicious backpack near a trashcan in an elizabeth, new jersey trashcan. the men who reported it said they could see a pipe and wires sticking out of the bag. when police arrived they discovered five different devices but when a bomb squad robot approached the bag one of the devices exploded, fortunately no one was injured. update: elizabeth, nj mayor says five devices found in bag near train station. one exploded while bomb squad robot tried to disarm it — fox news (@foxnews) september 19, 2016  the latest bomb scare comes just one day after two other bombs exploded (one in seaside park, new jersey and one in manhattan) and three more were found by authorities before they could be detonated. late sunday evening authorities announced that they believed all five bombs from saturday were the work of the same people, then later in the night they announced that they had made five arrests in connection with the bombs. federal authorities conducted a traffic stop of a “vehicle of interest” in the chelsea bombing sunday night in brooklyn. a law enforcement source told fox news that a “number of individuals” who are possibly connected to the explosion were taken into custody. law enforcement officials told the associated press that at least 5 men were being questioned. the two officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about an ongoing investigation. the fbi said in a statement that no one had been charged with any crime and the investigation was ongoing. there is no word yet if the latest group of bombs found in elizabeth, are connected to the just detained persons of interest. elizabeth, new jersey mayor, christian bollwage speaking to the media about the bomb (you can see more video from the scene here):  update: the man sought in connection with the bombings in manhattan and seaside park, new jersey has been captured after a shootout with police. new photo: ahmad rahami captured in linden, nj, senior law enforcement official says https://t.co/kuir1q6luf pic.twitter.com/fyyurizieu — nbc new york (@nbcnewyork) september 19, 2016  ahmad khan rahami is a muslim man of afghani origin who was living in elizabeth, new jersey (the city where the bombs were found late last night/early this morning). authorities had launched a dragnet earlier monday in search of the 28-year-old afghan-born man, whom they described as being “armed and dangerous” a naturalized u.s. citizen, rahami was wanted for questioning regarding the saturday night blast in new york’s chelsea neighborhood, an explosion in new jersey’s seaside park on saturday morning and a foiled bomb attack sunday night near a train station in elizabeth, nj. an eyewitness to rahami’s capture in linden, nj told fox news that he saw a man walking down a street with a gun in his hand. a police car pulled up next to him and the man fired at cops 4-6 times. the shooter then began running down the street with several police cars trailing him, the witness, peter bilinskas, said. after days of pretending that the bombings were not the work of islamic terrorists it seems that new york’s liberals are finally beginning to understand the truth. if a bomb goes off on american soil, it is more likely than not the work of muslim terrorists. “today i believe we’re going to find out that [the bombing] was influenced by foreign sources,” gov. andrew cuomo said monday on “fox & friends.” reposted with permission from constitution.com  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      breaking: another bomb explodes in new jersey…update: suspect arrested

__label__1 an article by former assistant u.s. attorney andrew c. mccarthy in national review on monday that is critical of democrat barack obama and hillary clinton’s counterterrorism efforts has been censored by twitter as being “unsafe” in their view. the article, titled “the mulish stupidity of clinton-obama counterterrorism” when clicked on from twitter, results in the following ominous-sounding warning:  andrew mccarthy, who led the 1995 terrorism against  sheikh omar abdel rahman and eleven other radical islamic terrorists, announced the censorship in a separate post on national review on monday evening. in the article, mccarthy makes the point that the today’s defenders of radical islamic terrorism — progressive leftist democrats — sound precisely like the attorney’s representing the islamists in the cases he prosecuted in the 90’s. “as i have previously recounted, when i prosecuted the blind sheikh’s terrorist cell in the mid-nineties, the defense lawyers for the jihadists – who sounded just like today’s anti-anti-terrorist progressives – claimed that their clients had been lured into terrorist activity by u.s. government policy and by the enticements of a government informant who spouted islam-against-the-world rhetoric. in response to this fatuous contention, we put a very simple question to the jury: “what would it take to turn you into a mass-murderer?” what policy could be so bad, what rhetorical us-against-them flourishes so inspiring, that a person would join the terrorist cause and commit acts of barbarism?” read more of the article that twitter doesn’t want you to read here.  email subscribe      the hardest-hitting political news.

__label__1 if you are one of the gop candidates who is still saying #nevertrump, you have been warned. republican national committee chairman reince priebus on sunday suggested he could say “never mind” to the “never trump” candidates should they try to make another run for the presidency. that is one way to get your troops to fall in line. will the big heads get the message?  as written, reported and seen first on fox news: republican national committee chairman reince priebus on sunday suggested he could say “never mind” to the “never trump” candidates should they try to make another run for the presidency. priebus said the former primary challengers who’ve refused to support republican presidential nominee donald trump could face consequences if they fail to back trump in the stretch-run to election day. “those people need to get on board,” priebus told “face the nation.” “and if they’re thinking they’re going to run again some day, i think that we’re going to evaluate the process – of the nomination process and i don’t think it’s going to be that easy for them.” priebus didn’t specifically name the group, but ohio gov. john kasich, texas sen. ted cruz and former florida gov. jeb bush are the most prominent ex-gop primary candidates to refuse to support trump. cruz and bush were locked in particularly nasty verbal spats during the campaign with trump, who termed his opponents “lyin’ ted” and “low-energy jeb.” though kasich and trump rarely went toe-to-toe, kasich was the last trump challenger to drop out of the race, and despite the republican national convention being held in cleveland, the ohio governor didn’t set foot in quicken loans arena. cruz spoke at the convention, but he was booed off the stage when he told the assembled, largely pro-trump crowd to “vote your conscience.” despite the intra-party squabbles, however, priebus made his case by pointing to a pledge that each primary candidate signed vowing to support the eventual republican nominee….. full story here: candidates who don’t back trump may not be allowed to run again, rnc chairman says | fox news      gop ‘never trump’ candidates get a warning      
__label__1 it seems as if our suspicions were correct from the onset. hillary clinton and her ‘physician’ are not telling the american people the truth about her health. this is the woman who claims transparency and as has never lied. in a recent report from the liberal leaning new york times, dr. lawrence k. altman m.d. brings it all out into the open. the doctor also makes sure to point out that what was released by trump was not extensive enough too. read the story below.  as written by lawrence k. altman, m.d. for the new york times: the disclosure last week that hillary clinton was beingtreated for pneumonia thrust the health of both of the major parties’ presidential candidates and their running mates to the center of the campaign, and led to the release of more detailed medical histories from the two candidates seeking what is widely regarded as the world’s most demanding job. mrs. clinton, 68, the democratic presidential nominee, who has had serious medical problems in recent years, released on wednesday an update of a july 2015 letter from her doctor attesting to her overall good health and ability to serve a full four-year term as president. however, the doctor, dr. lisa bardack of mt. kisco, n.y., noted that mrs. clinton had developed two new medical conditions in 2016: a sinus and ear infection in the winter and pneumonia this month. dr. bardack wrote that she had regularly examined mrs. clinton this year for routine care and that she had been closely monitoring her pneumonia, which is improving. but doctors not connected with the candidate’s care say that the letters omit basic information like height and weight, and that a more detailed history of her blood clots and a 2012 concussion should be disclosed. still, the information mrs. clinton has made public is more extensive than the details … full story here: how healthy is hillary clinton? doctors weigh in – the new york times      nyt: crucial details omitted, discordant accounts on hillary health      
__label__1 a donald trump supporter in bellingham, washington delivered a shocking rebuke to an obvious hillary clinton fan that may have jolted some sense into her – literally. when local police failed to respond to ray gilbride’s complaints that someone was removing “trump” signs from his front yard, he decided to take matters into his own hands – and not merely because the culprit was interfering with his constitutional right to express his political opinion. “the fact is, stealing is stealing. i’m getting a lot of that criticism, too, people saying it’s just a sign. why do we prosecute kids for stealing just a candy bar? situational ethics is wrong. stealing is stealing. you’ve got to go back to the basics. if it’s not yours don’t touch it.” and it wasn’t just theft – whoever was removing the “trump” signs was trespassing on gilbride’s property. so, after talking to police about his legal options to protect his property – the front yard and the signs – gilbride rigged up a trip-wire and hooked it up to a non-lethal electric charge that would deliver a surprise to the clinton-supporting thief the next time she made a late night raid. “it would have been different if somebody hooked it to a 110 (volt) outlet and watched somebody get hurt,” said gilbride, adding that a pulsating charge similar to that used in invisible pet fences doesn’t do any lasting damage.  sure enough, the surveillance camera caught the image of the unsuspecting woman running onto gilbride’s yard in the middle of the night, making her way to the now-electrified “trump” sign. “she just stopped, just a dead stop,” gilbride told local news reporters. the woman, who remains unidentified, eventually regained her senses, according to the laughing homeowner, and was able to make off with the signs, anyway. presumably she wouldn’t be quite as in favor of this form of supporting a candidate if it was gilbride sneaking onto her yard in the middle of the night to steal “i’m with her” signs. funny how that works for some liberals.       trump supporter electrifies his yard sign to zap pesky vandals      
__label__1 scroll down for video there’s little doubt that this campaign season has been anything but civil, the issues of immigration, national security, terrorism and the economy have all taken a toll on america’s psyche, and whether we like it or not, we’ve all collectively witnessed our institutions slowly fall into disrepair by corruption, greed and malfeasance, by those individuals who have sworn under oath to defend and preserve those same institutions. and while the political elites attempt to bring down trump, they forget or attempt to distract the public, that they are the political class, and are directly responsible for america’s decline, and aside from the phony who currently resides at 1600 pennsylvania avenue, there’s another phony, in one hillary clinton, who has been a career politician for decades, and who now claims to be an outsider, regardless of the fact that she and bill clinton have amassed a huge fortune. perhaps this 3-minute video clip best illustrates how these two career politicians have used the system to enrich themselves by creating perhaps the largest criminal enterprise within american politics, known as the “clinton foundation” which promotes itself as a worldwide outreach charitable organization, while at the same time a financial slush fund for these two. hillary clinton as secretary of state, sold access to anyone and everyone with an open checkbook, while bill used her influence to enrich himself with blotted speaking fees to those same countries donating vast sums of money to the foundation, by selling america down the drain to the highest bidder.  do you think hillary being involved in so many instances of lying and scandals should disqualify her as president? share this with family and friends and comment with your thoughts below if you think so.       video of hillary that’s fast gaining traction on web might blow her chances in election

__label__1 what is behind the news media’s lack of coverage of recent terror attacks in our country? i learned of the recent bombings and stabbings from the post i read on the internet. you would think that this would be covered extensively by all of the major news networks, wouldn’t you? perhaps these attacks have been caused by a video. i am sure hillary clinton would like you to believe that donald trump is personally responsible for the current bout of jihad in the usa. she has come awfully close to implying it. these attacks couldn’t be caused by obama’s failed immigration policies oh no no no; the same policies that hillary promises to administer full speed ahead. perhaps the media is downplaying these tragedies in order to prevent a shadow of blame being cast on crooked hillary. cnn, msn, cbs, abc, nbc, and even fox would never ever be used as a propaganda machine to prop up crooked hillary, would they? what kind of deplorable person could doubt the credibility of today’s american media? what happened to america? the news i watch today is twisted into propaganda resembling the propaganda that was dished out to citizens of the soviet union; they tell us twisted versions of the news containing enough grain of truth to fool the sheep. bold faced lies. anyone with half a brain should see right through it.       our propaganda media      
__label__1 there are severe penalties for lying in the courts and lying to congress.  with this premium on truth you would think any government operation would necessarily be truth driven.  after witnessing the idiotic promises from candidates for public office you may begin to suspect that the honoring of truth is only for those who are not in government or who get caught.  the problem is the issue is far more grave than most people suspect even in their most dubious moods.  the issue i am talking about is in the field of government accounting. now we all know about the $600 hammers and the waste in superfluous studies that find the obvious and spend billions to do it.  but this accounting is small potatoes beside the larger issue of how the government manipulates the core index when trying to downplay the real rate of inflation.  now just a word about the insidiousness of inflation and the consequences of allowing it to creep into full blown hyper-inflation.  countries have turned from peace to war, democracies to dictatorships, semi-free to fascist and completely collapsed because they were unable or unwilling to control inflation.  check out the demise of major powers past and present and you will find an unsound currency is the one common factor that contributed to the collapse/demise.  and the soundness of the currency was always based on the government creating currency in volumes that had no backing except the promise to pay from further borrowing, taxation and currency expansion ( i.e the printing of paper money ). with so much at stake you would think the government would want to know exactly what is the rate of inflation and how can it be kept under control.  after all how could anyone be so suicidal to hide the figures that would need to be reviewed and acted upon to perpetuate a country’s government?  as i spoke of in an earlier article, politicians are sacrificial both in what they seek and what they ask of their constituents.  this sacrificial banner becomes a shroud for themselves when the seek to deceive and ignore what they think they are getting away with because no one is naming the issue.  this is why they have earned so much distrust and disapproval. fro a complete understanding of the hideousness of the government’s attempt to distort and hide true inflation rates i refer you to an article written by jim puplava at http://www.financialsense.com/stormwatch/2005/0624.html .  what motivates the people on a committee to deliberately distort the way the government determines inflation rates so that the government can continue its deficit spending and ultimately bankrupting  the country?  it is the same motivation of the unrepentant cookie stealer.  they think they can get away with it.  and they can and they will if no one calls them to task and points out the dishonesty they are promoting.  in today’s world of politics it would require a ground swell of voters making enough noise and demanding accurate honest figures but most voters are ignorant of the practices and gullible regarding the truly evil motives at work in the bowels of the very organization that is charged with protecting the country. the irony is the stupidity of those who think they are pulling the wool over the eyes of the populace. what they are hiding are the very facts and figures that will protect not only the country but their livelihood and their ultimate survival.  this is beyond stupid and certainly falls well within the category of criminality.  this in an organization that is charged with protecting the citizenry from criminals.  but what security is there in the fox guarding the hen house? this issue is not covered on the financial channels on tv to any extent.  it is ignored by the press and all the talk radio pundits rarely question what is obvious to everyday americans watching prices go through the roof.  when the issue is brought up, americans are prone to trust the government to give accurate figures and believe the inflation rate, no matter how it is computed , is real and there is no need for concern.  as ronald reagan said, “ trust but verify”.  there is no verification to be found that the figures being spouted are true.  the real figures are much higher and this means the government has less financial problems to worry about as long as they can push this scam down the populace’s throat.  the adjustments to social security are lower because of these bogus figures, the government debt is viewed as lower because of these figures, the weak dollar is the result of the real figures the government doesn’t want to face up to  and the cheap appearance of the coinage reflects the same phenomena. now that the american public is getting excited about a presidential race it is time to ask these pretentious candidates what they know about the “core index” that reflects the rate of inflation and what are they going to do to get the government to recognize it is deceiving the american public with its bogus rate of inflation to the detriment of the entire country.  there is not one candidate that has brought the issue up and there is not one who will have a satisfactory answer to why they haven’t.  if you believe the press has commentators that can ask hard questions you need to take a hard look at this very pressing issue and ask yourself why this has not even been raised.  the emperor of inflation is parading around naked as a jay bird and no one in the reporting business has even spotted him. not only is the government deceiving and manipulating the american public but the free press charged with finding the truth and reporting on it ,is ignoring the very essence of our survival as a nation.  there has been a concern with human cloning expressed by the u.n. and others, but the cloning from our universities has already occurred.  the clones are the genetic/intellectual equivalent of their instructors who dream of a fantasy modeled by plato’s utopia and care not one whit about the truth nor the means of attainment. as with the soviet experiment, what they seek is oblivion. faking reality doesn’t change reality , it only destroys the dishonest.  facing reality requires a hard cold look not a placating syrupy soothing assurance that all is well and will turn out for the best if we’ll just be faithful , trusting and above all quiet.  the terrorists on 9/11 offered such assurances to the trusting passengers as they flew into oblivion.  we are passengers in the same predicament and like the passengers in pennsylvania we need to “roll” or perish for the ideals of the misguided, misinformed, dishonest pretending to work for the public good.       the criminality in government accounting

__label__1 one question on the mind of many is why would the clinton it staff plead the 5th? based on this report from the ny post, we may have part of our answer: the fbi report noted there were many hacking attempts into the system, both while clinton was secretary of state and afterward when platte river networks took over the administration of the home server. the agency said none had been successful, and it never named the hackers or their points of origin. but multiple internal platte river e-mails reviewed by the post show that computers in china tried on three occasions in 2014 to log into clinton’s server and a computer in russia tried once in 2013. the internal communications also revealed how the execs belatedly tightened security on clinton’s now-controversial home server and frantically sought to “cover our asses” when news broke that the former secretary of state’s communications were deleted. “any chance you found an old e-mail with their directives to cut the backups back in oct‐-feb? . . . if we had that e-mail, we are golden,” platte river it consultant bill thornton wrote to colleagues on aug. 19, 2015. “wondering how we can sneak an e-mail in now after the fact asking them when they told us to cut the backups and have them confirm it for our records. starting to think this whole thing really is covering up some shaddy s- -t.” thornton and fellow platte river specialist paul combetta refused to answer questions last week before a congressional committee probing the server scandal. each cited his fifth amendment rights. recently judicial watch submitted questions to hillary clinton that a federal judge required her to answer. that may be why crooked hillary almost passed out on 9-11, since the date looms. perhaps we will finally get real answers to the racketeering of the clinton mafia.       why clinton it staff took the 5th

__label__0 washington (cnn)former "miss universe" alicia machado struck back tuesday against insults hurled at her by donald trump, saying that he was "aggressive" and "really rude." machado, who represented venezuela in trump's 1996 "miss universe" competition said that trump called her "miss housekeeping" and "miss piggy" when she gained weight after winning the beauty pageant. "i know what i left with him and he knows, too. and he was really aggressive. he was really rude. he was a bad person with me," she told cnn's anderson cooper on "ac360." "that is the story that i need to share with my community. we cannot accept no more insults for my latin community. no more insults for the women. i know very well mr. trump and i can see the same person that i met 20 years ago." at the presidential debate on monday, clinton referenced machado to make a bigger point to trump about his public treatment of women -- which has become a key campaign issue that hits on his vulnerabilities with both hispanics and women. "and one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest -- he loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them -- and he called this woman 'miss piggy,' then he called her 'miss housekeeping' because she was latina," clinton had said. she continued: "donald, she has a name. her name is alicia machado. and she has become a us citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this november." read: 'miss universe' tearfully thanks clinton for defense against trump's 'miss piggy' remarks cooper also asked machado about reports that she was accused of driving a getaway car from a murder scene soon after the "miss universe" pageant. "there are reports that trump surrogates tonight have been referencing and been pointing to ... about an incident in 1998 in venezuela where you were accused of driving a getaway car from a murder scene. you were never charged with this. the judge in the case also said you threatened to kill him after he indicted your boyfriend for the attempted murder. i just want to give you a chance to respond these reports," cooper said. machado responded: "he can say whatever he wants to say. i don't care. you know, i have my past, of course everybody has a past. and i'm no saint girl. but that is not the point now ... (trump) was really rude with me, he tried to destroy my self esteem. and now i'm a voice in the latin community. i'm in a great moment in my life and i have a very clear life. and i can show my taxes." earlier tuesday, trump refused to back down from his criticism of machado, telling "fox and friends" in an interview that she had "gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem." "she was the winner and you know, she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem. we had a real problem," trump said. "not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so hillary went back into the years and she found this girl -- this was many years ago. and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother theresa. and it wasn't quite that way but that's ok. hillary has to do what she has to do."       miss universe strikes back      
__label__0 washington (cnn)russia might be behind the hack of the democratic national committee, according to us officials and lawmakers -- but not donald trump. the republican presidential nominee came up with many alternative possibilities at the first general election debate on monday night. "it could be russia, but it could also be china. it could also be lots of other people," he said during the first presidential debate. "it also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds." he also devoted a portion of his answer about cyberattacks to the precociousness of his 10-year-old son. "so we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. it is a huge problem. i have a son. he's 10 years old. he has computers. he is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. the security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. and maybe it's hardly doable," he said. cnn's reality check vets the claims of the debate rep. adam schiff, the top democrat on the house intelligence committee, said maybe trump is confused about where the hacker's "bed" lies. "my guess is if this guy weighs 400 pounds he's sitting somewhere in russia right now," schiff told cnn's wolf blitzer on "the situation room" tuesday. "i just find this, like his statements about isis that played into russian propaganda, really deplorable." and cyber experts say the remarks seem unaware of the seriousness of the threat. "i was pretty surprised during the debate -- there is no ambiguity here," former obama administration cybersecurity official chris finan said. "everybody knows who did it. so to suggest it was an individual -- and the other thing is -- these intrusion sets are fairly sophisticated," said finan, now ceo at manifold technology. "to say it was an individual or lone actor or small group, that to me shows a lack of appreciation about the threat and how sophisticated and pernicious it is." so how on-target was trump with his cybersecurity comments? here are some expert perspectives. could a 400-pound hacker have pulled the dnc breach off? the short answer is no, said dmitri alperovitch, co-founder of crowdstrike, the cybersecurity firm that investigated and responded to the hack of the dnc. it's nearly impossible to know any hacker's weight. but one thing that is clear to experts like alperovitch is that government-backed hackers are well-staffed and well-resourced, using very particular software, break-in tactics and cover-up techniques that act as a signature of each group. dnc hack: what you need to know in the case of the dnc, crowdstrike discovered two groups inside the system, working unbeknownst to the other, which are well-known as russian-linked hacking operations and have breached dozens or even hundreds of high-value targets like government agencies, high-level officials' offices and think tanks. alperovitch said it was "pretty unlikely" an individual could have mimicked all the various ways that these groups are distinct, from the software to the "tradecraft." let alone the other targets bearing the same signatures. there has been some official talk of russian involvement, hasn't there? us officials have only pointed at russia anonymously, not wanting to ruffle the delicate moscow-washington relationship at this point.o but us officials from president barack obama on down have warned about russia efforts to interfere in the election through hacking. two arrested for hacking us officials director of national intelligence james clapper has been one of the more forward-leaning. "they see a us conspiracy behind every bush," clapper said a few weeks ago when asked if the russians wanted to disrupt the presidential vote. "they believe that we are trying to influence political developments in russia, and so their natural response is to retaliate." could an individual hacker still do damage? most definitely. beyond russia and other nation-state attackers and financially motivated criminal operators, often organized in mafia-like gangs, there are also lone-wolf hackers. experts divide them into categories like "hacktivists" and "script kiddies," opportunistic hackers motivated by notoriety or fame. examples include guccifer, a now-convicted romanian hacker who recently pleaded guilty to hacking the accounts of the family of president george w. bush and former secretary of state colin powell. lawmakers say russia behind hacks (a character claiming credit for the dnc hack surfaced online going by "guccifer 2.0," but alperovitch said that was just an attempt to divert suspicion from the russians as the guccifer redux" has been proven to not natively speak romanian.") in another case, two north carolina men were arrested for allegedly breaking into the email accounts of cia director john brennan and national intelligence director james clapper. how do individuals go about their hacking? while carrying out an attack the level of the dnc hack requires skill and manpower that individuals don't possess, attacks like breaking a few email accounts is within the realm of a single hacker. often the perpetrators use what's known as social engineering -- gathering clues about a person from their public life online and then using it to guess passwords or security questions to get into accounts and release the contents online. but that's still probably beyond the abilities of most 10-year-olds.       is trump right? could a 400-pound couch potato have hacked the dnc?      
__label__0 washington (cnn)the arizona republic, the state's largest newspaper, has never endorsed a democrat for president -- until now. in an op-ed published to its website tuesday, the editorial board backed hillary clinton over donald trump for president. "the 2016 republican candidate is not conservative and he is not qualified," the editorial board wrote. in the op-ed, the newspaper's editorial board breaks down why they believe that clinton is more qualified than trump -- specifically that the democratic nominee has better temperament and experience, has a record of public service, and has withstood "decades of scrutiny." the arizona republic joins other major papers with conservative editorial boards in endorsing clinton or declining to endorse trump. the cincinnati enquirer and dallas morning news are two other notable examples, with the enquirer endorsing a democrat for the first time in 100 years. the new hampshire union leader, for the first time in 100 years, did not back republican nominee trump, opting instead to endorse libertarian nominee gary johnson. the arizona republic endorsement said that clinton, unlike trump, for all of her mistakes and flaws, and has more experience with foreign policy than trump does. and specifically for arizona -- a state with a significant latino population -- the newspaper said trump wouldn't be able to "broker solutions" like clinton. the paper cites a recent poll that shows arizonians oppose both a border wall and deportations as solutions for illegal immigration. the newspaper editorial board also cited what it called trump's frequent disrespect toward other people as reasons to oppose him. including his mocking of a reporter's physical disability, his public feud with a gold star family, and his proposal to ban muslim immigrants from entering the united states. the newspaper said that trump is a candidate who can't control his words, unlike clinton. and it writes that clinton "can reach out to those who feel left behind. she can make it clear that america sees them and will address their concerns."       arizona republic endorses clinton for president, first time ever backing a democrat      
__label__1 hillary clinton has taken her illegal actions to a new level with a new move that involves enlisting the help of illegal immigrants to help her beat donald trump in november. once again, hillary is in violation of 8 u.s. code § 1324, which makes it a felony to ‘conceal’ or ‘harbor’ any ‘alien’ ‘including any means of transportation.’ the penalty is five years in prison (ten years if it was done for “commercial advantage or private financial gain,” could be made for that). hillary and the dnc also violated this law a few weeks back at the democratic national convention when they paraded two illegal immigrants across the stage to give an anti-trump speech. from fox news: hillary clinton is enlisting undocumented “dreamers” into a new voter registration drive aimed at signing up sympathetic voters with warnings that donald trump’s immigration plans could result in their deportation – though the dreamers themselves cannot legally vote.   clinton’s national voter registration program, called “mi sueño, tu voto/my dream, your vote,” was announced sunday, on the four-year anniversary of the 2012 order that temporarily shielded from deportation some young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. the 730,000 young people known as dreamers are prohibited from voting. however, they remain a powerful political organizing force, and the clinton campaign hopes to use them to convince latino and other households to go to the polls for the democratic nominee.        fox news just exposed hillary’s illegal voting scheme that rigs election against trump

__label__1 terrorism seems to be producing more stupidity than fear, i keep hearing the word suspect or suspected every time a bomb goes off in america or when the words allahu akbar is screamed out when a mass shooting takes place. i get to listen to a new york mayor tell the nation that the bomb blast had no relation to the bomb blast in new jersey on the same day. i guess the fbi could learn a lot from this mayor. a reporter on fox news says the bomb  could have been a pressure cooker that someone put in the garbage can by mistake. the media will put on experts and have many opinions to tell all about something that needs no explanation except just one. these muslims are going to kill us unless we kill them first. when law enforcement catches or kills one i could care less about his personal history that the media always uses to make a good story to tell. the only thing i care about is punishing him without the pleasure of giving him a life sentence in a prison where he gets to choose his food from a muslim menu, free medical service, recreation facilities,  a tv to watch his friends terrorist activities all over the world and a quran with a prayer rug. terrorists should be tried by law within thirty days after their capture and sentenced  in the same time frame. i am just a simple man and i would rather form my own opinion than letting the media doing it for me. after all, who wants to be stupid?       no mercy for the terrorists      
__label__1 donald trump is most criticized for his temperament to the point of many saying it disqualifies him from the office of president. lets look at trumps objectionable temperament and then see what it has to do with being president. mark mellman made these observations “…a crucial contrast on character is frankly much more powerful than when you make a contrast on policy.” this is why we are looking at character in the first place, so we do not look at failed policies. dr. frank said, “most of my colleagues feel that he’s not crazy, and if he is crazy, he’s crazy like a fox,”. dan p. adams,who analyzes character traits concluded not surprisingly, that donald trump has “sky-high extroversion combined with off-the-chart low agreeableness (the extent to which a person appears to be caring, loving, affectionate, polite, and kind). anger may be the operative emotion behind trump’s high extroversion as well as his low agreeableness. anger can fuel malice, but it can also motivate social dominance, stoking a desire to win the adoration of others. trump may be a more flexible and pragmatic decision maker, more like bill clinton than bush. decision makers who, like nixon, who are dispositionally low on agreeableness might hold certain advantages when it comes to balancing competing interests or bargaining with adversaries.” many other presidents ranked high in these traits. among them was lyndon johnson who scored the highest, followed closely by teddy roosevelt, andrew jackson, franklin d. roosevelt, john f. kennedy, richard nixon, and bill clinton. trump’s personality type is classified as a promoter. other non-presidents who fit this category are ernest hemingway, eva peron, winston churchill, grace slick, madonna, george s. patton, and steve jobs. “they are bold and daring at heart, and ever-optimistic that things will go their way. promoters will take tremendous risks to get what they want, and seem exhilarated by walking close to the edge of disaster. because of this, they make the very best trouble-spot administrators and negotiators, and they can be outstanding entrepreneurs, able to swing deals and kick-start enterprises in a way no other type can.” says dan adams, take andrew jackson for example. his campaign centered on jackson’s image as a man of the people battling aristocracy and corruption. strong-willed and sharp-tempered, a fierce patriot and rabid partisan, jackson was always controversial. he personalized disputes and demonized opponents. yet behind jackson’s towering rages often lay shrewd calculation of their political effects. jackson’s quick temper was notorious. his audacity on behalf of the people earned him enemies who slandered him. jackson was often in control of his rage, and used it (and his fearsome reputation) as a tool to get what he wanted in his public and private affairs. his opponents were terrified of his temper: observers likened him to a volcano, and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt. he believed that the president is not just an executive but also a representative of all the people. he entered office determined to end government corruption and the nation’s financial difficulties caused, he thought, by the upper-class elite in government, business, and finance.(taken from a variety of historical sources). rather than disqualifying donald trump, his temperament may make him the most qualified. like andrew jackson, we may not like him, but if we are looking for a more flexible and pragmatic decision maker,who may hold certain advantages when it comes to balancing competing interests or bargaining with adversaries, someone who is bold and daring at heart, and ever-optimistic that things will go the right way for the american people, able to take tremendous risks to get what he wants, the very best trouble-spot administrator and negotiator, able to swing deals and kick-start the economy in a way no other can, then we might have to overlook the baggage that comes with donald trump.       presidential temperament      
__label__1 donald trump has just received what has to be his most positive poll of the general election season, showing the republican nominee opening up a large lead over hillary clinton, while support among black voters is soaring to levels democrats had not thought possible. the new usc dornsife/los angeles times “daybreak” poll released on sunday shows trump with a commanding 6.7 percent lead over clinton, 47.7 percent to 41.0 percent, an indication that hillary’s collapsing after being forced to leave a 9/11 memorial early is taking its toll, along with the every changing explanations for the health scare from her campaign, which ranged from “overheated” to the flu, to pneumonia. more impressive and yet worrisome for democrats, and the reason the party, all democrat media complex, and hillary clinton herself has been going full-force with the “birther equals racist” narrative, is trump’s massive gains among black voters in the past week. trump now has over 20 percent support among black voters, up from only 3 percent just a week ago. hillary clinton has 70 percent, significantly lower than the number typically enjoyed by democrat nominees. notable is that voters under the age of 35 previously were favored by sizable margins by clinton, but now the bloviating billionaire and reality tv actor has an 8-point advantage. and among those with a high school education or less, trump’s support has surged to a 21-point advantage, up from single digits only weeks ago. the la times poll has before been favorable to trump previously, showing the race tighter than most when clinton was leading significantly. however, this poll, with trump’s sizable lead and improving performance among black voters, has got to cause panic among democrats and the clinton campaign. i thought several times last week that democrats must be really worried about trump going after black voters with the focus suddenly being on birtherism — an issue that hadn’t been talked about for several months that the media just recently brought back into the conversation. it’s likely that clinton’s internal polling was also showing trump’s surge among black voters even before the la times poll. look for the race card to be ramped up even further in the coming days.  email subscribe      the hardest-hitting political news.

__label__1 scroll down for video it’s often been said with some humor,that behind every conservative lies a liberal who was once mugged, and perhaps black activist jerry ford jr. will become the latest robbery victim to join the ever-growing ranks. this latest incident took place on the campus at the university of houston when grad student ford a ‘black lives matter” member and group leader was robbed at gun point, as he was about to enter his apartment. he describes walking by a young man apparently loitering next to his apartment complex, and thought nothing of it until he unlocked his door, and then the young thug sprung into action, pulling out a hand gun and demanding ford’s wallet and cell phone, which of course ford surrendered. ironically ford is running for texas state representative, while also a vocal activist and head of houston chapter of “black lives matter”, which of course promotes the de-funding of many police programs around the country. and which of course made his comments after being robbed all the more ludicrous stating: “i hope they (the police), would take a bigger stance and put more security over here because you have a lot of people walking back and forth to class.” ford also added that because the housing is off campus, it isn’t patrolled by university police security, which he would like to see it changed for the protection of the students…it would seem that a conservative by any other name, is a liberal once mugged. then after this blm "activist" actually had the nerve to actually ask for more protection from the police he comically had this to say about the thief, "i would've gave him money," he said. "i would've talked to him because the real crime is why is he in that position that he feels the need to come and hang out at a college campus and rob people of stuff they worked for." right. good idea jerry. that will solve the problem. check out ford's call for more police presence here: source: abc 13       watch: black lives matter supporter makes insulting demand from cops after he’s robbed at gunpoint…

__label__1 “rather than end dangerous politically-driven policies that have put a total of 85,000 deportable criminal aliens back onto the streets in the last three years, ice tried to hide them by providing grossly inaccurate information to congress and the american people.” —dan stein, president of fair in a report released by the federation of american immigration reform (fair), they have charged that the obama administration “grossly misrepresented – by almost tenfold” the number of crimes that were committed by illegal, criminal aliens who were released from custody in fiscal year 2014. now, if the term “illegal, criminal aliens” sounds like overkill, understand that the term illegal does refer to aliens who are in the united states illegally, which makes them criminals. however, applying the term criminal relates to the fact that they committed a crime while here illegals and were incarcerated, but not deported. “in response to an inquiry from the house judiciary committee in july 2015, ice reported that the 30,558 criminal aliens it released, instead of deported, in fy 2014 were convicted of an additional 1,423 offenses,” read fair’s press release. “however, the ice records that were requested by the immigration reform law institute (irli) on fair’s behalf show that the actual number of subsequent convictions racked up by the criminal aliens ice released in fy 2014 was actually 13,288. it is important to note that not all criminal charges result in convictions. thus, the number of offenses committed by criminal aliens ice turned loose is likely significantly greater.” “the criminal aliens responsible for these 13,288 convictions were not considered sufficiently dangerous to be deported under ice’s self-declared ‘priorities’ for removal,” the press release added. “the list of convictions for offenses committed by criminals ice did not deem worthy of deportation in fy 2014 includes: homicide, kidnapping, assault, sexual assault, drunk driving, and other offenses. yet despite the clear knowledge that its policies resulted in thousands of avoidable crimes, ice doubled down in fy 2015—releasing nearly 20,000 additional deportable criminals.” “in recent years, the number of criminal aliens deported has plummeted, despite ample funds to remove many more. as a result of obama administration policies that place protection of illegal aliens—including criminals—over the safety of the american public, thousands of people have been needlessly victimized,” charged dan stein, president of fair. “rather than end dangerous politically-driven policies that have put a total of 85,000 deportable criminal aliens back onto the streets in the last three years, ice tried to hide them by providing grossly inaccurate information to congress and the american people,” added stein. “moreover, despite knowing the true extent of the criminal activities committed by the aliens they were releasing, dhs scrapped the secure communities program designed to allow ice to take custody of criminal aliens who are being held by local police.” “congress has to act. it is being lied to by an administration that is misrepresenting the facts and a president that refuses to enforce immigration laws in favor of manipulating policy for political gain,” stein concluded. in march of 2015 freedom of information act documents exposed the fact that 165,900 convicted criminal illegals were released on the streets of the us by homeland security. they were not deported. in fact, so-called “sanctuary cities” released 9,000 criminal illegals in 9 months during 2015 who were supposed to be deported, but never were. in 2014, it was also reported the administration released 75% of illegals rather than deport them. it appears to me that dhs needs to be renamed the department of homeland in-security. what do you think? reposted with permission from freedom outpost  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      obama administration “grossly misrepresenting” crimes committed by illegal aliens!

__label__1 last week i wrote an article titled “donald trump’s amazing week” which must have been incredibly annoying to liberals and “never trumpers” everywhere. guess what? this past week has been even better for the 2016 republican nominee for president, the man whose candidacy was considered a vanity exercise a year and a half ago. well no one is laughing anymore. the latest round of polls shows that the support for the trump presidency is growing rapidly. the latest fox news poll, which was taken from september 11-14, shows donald trump polling at 46%, a one-point lead over democratic nominee hillary clinton at 45%.  the la times/usc poll taken from september 9-15 shows trump at 47% with a six-point lead over clinton at 41%. the gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states. the suffolk university poll which was taken from september 12-14 shows trump at 42%, leading by 3 points with clinton at 39%. the cnn/orc poll, which was taken september 7-12 shows trump with a 4-point lead over clinton in florida. clinton still has about a 3-5 point lead over trump in other key battleground states, including pennsylvania and michigan, but those gaps are getting narrower every day. other states such as nevada and new hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for clinton have moved to the “toss up state” category. donald trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform, his childcare plan at a speech in aston pa, just outside of philadelphia.  spearheaded by his daughter ivanka trump, trump’s childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum.  the plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers. this benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program.  lower income families will also benefit from the plan’s offering of childcare rebates through the earned income tax credit (eitc) program up to $1,200 per year.  middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns.  families will also have the ability to establish dependent care savings accounts (dcsas) to put money aside tax free for childcare. low income families will receive a 50% match of the first $1000 deposited per year, generating up to an additional $500 per eligible family per year. dcsas can be applied to pay for childcare, after school enrichment programs and school choice. families can also use the funds in a dcsa to care for an elderly parent’s expenses including in home nursing and long-term care.  finally, trump’s childcare plan provides a tax deduction for stay-at-home parents, effectively eliminating the tax punishment for a parent’s decision to leave the workforce to be a full time caregiver for child or an elderly parent. donald trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the economic club of new york which includes some of new york’s most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance. trump’s excellent week continued with his visit to the dr. oz show where he released a letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history. other than carrying an extra 15-20 pounds, trump appears to be in excellent health. of course, trump’s unveiling his medical records on a television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about hillary clinton’s health following her fainting at last week’s september 11 memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia. again, only donald trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event. well, it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on the dr. oz show, a program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with a large percentage of female viewers. during the one hour program, the discussion of trump’s health was followed by the appearance of ivanka trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women.  so yes, somehow all this concern about hillary clinton’s health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for donald trump. trump followed up the dr. oz interview with a visit to the tonight show with jimmy fallon. during the visit, trump permitted the late night comedian to do something “unpresidential”. that is to say, he told fallon that he could “mess up his hair”.  while most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely pre-planned,  the fact that trump said “yes” to the display speaks volumes.  he demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have a bad picture taken. furthermore, the tonight show is popular with democrats and millennials of all political persuasions. once again, trump had an opportunity to make a connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the “trump train”.  oh and one more thing, by letting jimmy fallon touch his hair on national television, trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his.  however small, it’s another check mark in the honesty and transparency box. now if all of this was not enough, donald trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in the former post office site in washington dc where he received endorsements from military flag officers and fourteen medal of honor recipients.  trump used the event to not only promote his hotel project as being completed “two years early and under budget”, a metaphor for how he would manage the us economy, he also seized the moment to put an end to the “birther issue”.  trump took the microphone and said “not to mention her in the same breath,” (as the medal of honor recipients who had just endorsed him) “hillary clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. i finished it. i finished it,” he said. “president barack obama was born in the united states, period. now we all want to get back to making america strong and great again.” trump said. once again, political correctness be damned, donald trump has had another

__label__1 i was watching a local news show about a business called “out of the closet.” they are a series of thrift stores to benefit aids healthcare foundation. not only can you purchase second-hand and consignment merchandise, but you can get free hiv and std tests.  i found this rather curious. why would a pro-homosexual advocacy business like “out of the closet” be offering hiv and std tests? what is it about the sexual practices of homosexuals that they would need to be tested for sexual diseases?  i don’t need to be tested for hiv and stds. the only people who would need to be tested are those who engaged in behaviors that lead to hiv and stds. if two people are married and only engage in sex with one another, neither of them would ever get hiv or an std. the following is reported by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc): “sexually transmitted diseases (stds) have been increasing among gay and bisexual men, with recent increases in syphilis being documented across the country. in 2012, men who have sex with men (msm) accounted for 75% of primary and secondary syphilis cases in the united states. msm often are diagnosed with other stds, including chlamydia and gonorrhea infections.” one would think the aids scare of the 1980s would have been an empirical indicator that same-sex relationships, as well as shared drug needles, are destructive behaviors. we were told that anyone could get aids. there’s a commercial running today that makes this claim. if this is true, then all stores should be offering tests. but they don’t because it would be a massive insult to the vast majority of people who do not engage in same-sex sexual activity. another empirical indicator that same-sex relationships are abnormal is that there is no chance of procreation. homosexuals have to be artificially inseminated or adopt. when morality, science, and common sense conflict with liberal ideology, you can always count on governments to use force in order to make people comply.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      why do homosexuals need to be tested for hiv and aids, since their behavior is normal and healthy?      
__label__1 from the daily caller news foundation: democratic rep. corrine brown, who is currently facing felony charges for fraud, is trying to solicit donations online to fund her legal defense. brown, who currently represents florida’s 5th congressional district, was indicted in july on more than 20 counts of fraud. according to federal prosecutors, brown and a collaborator presented the non-profit one door for education as a scholarship fund, but instead used its finances as a personal slush fund. brown supposedly used the money to pay off back taxes and fund public events honoring herself. despite raising $800,000, one door awarded only a single $1,000 scholarship. brown’s political fortunes have collapsed since the indictment, but she has refused to give in. she has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and has refused to resign her seat even after losing the democratic primary in august. now, brown launched another fundraising campaign, trying to convince supporters they should fund her criminal defense. on the page for the corrine brown legal expense trust, brown argues that she is being prosecuted by sinister forces who want to bring down a powerful black woman. (indicted dem congresswoman compares her ordeal to dallas shooting) “during my entire political career, i have fought racism, injustice and advocated for individuals who normally get left behind,” the page says. “it should come as no surprise that some took offense to my efforts to stand up for you.” the page touts brown’s various political deeds during her congressional career, such as increasing the amount of gas tax money returned to florida, getting congressional gold medals for the first black members of the marine corps, and fighting against “stand your ground” gun laws. a lack of money isn’t the only problem with brown’s defense. three of her legal teams have dropped the case, with the most recent one citing “an atmosphere of hostility and distrust” for its decision to drop brown.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      dem. rep. facing 20 counts of fraud charges seeks donations for legal defense      
__label__1 secretary of state john kerry said at the global fishing watch reception in d.c. that there is a small group of americans who block every government action on global warming, because they think that once the ice caps melt – still waiting for that to happen – all that extra water will just “spill over the sides of a flat earth.”  manmade global warming proponents are always comparing those who disagree with them to “flat-earthers.” the idea that there was a time when christians and other “uneducated” people believed that the earth was flat is a complete myth. that myth was promulgated largely by darwinists in the latter part of the 19th century as a way to discredit creationists. there wasn’t ever a time when the consensus among christians was that the earth was flat. this lie was perpetuated to show that christians held to their “religious dogma” in spite of evidence discovered by “brave” and “objective” scientists who were persecuted by christians for their discovery. so in reality, opponents of columbus’s voyage didn’t actually say that they were concerned he might fall off the edge of the earth. their concern was mostly about how far he would be going in unknown territory and how much it would cost to finance such an expedition. what we do see throughout history is that the establishment of any particular field of study – whether it be science or medicine – is usually the group that holds fast to its theories in spite of new evidence and findings that might show the establishment to be in error. they hold on to their theories for political and financial reasons. they use their own clout to silence and/or ridicule those who threaten the status quo that they’ve created for themselves. and that’s just what the whole anthropogenic global warming myth is all about. they want to maintain their theories so they can benefit politically and financially from them. they can twist the scientific data to make it say whatever they want. and any scientist who tries to expose them for trying to cram inflated data inside a pre-formulated theory is ignored or discredited. we all know how an establishment treats whistleblowers.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      john kerry: global warming deniers block action on climate change, because they’re flat-earthers      
__label__1 they don’t call cnn the clinton news network for nothing. they’re there to defend the presidential candidate at all costs and not let any inconvenient facts get in the way. cnn host chris cuomo – the new york governor’s little brother – got into a tense exchange with one of donald trump’s advisers boris epshteyn. cuomo argued that trump should come clean with the birther issue, just as hillary clinton owned up to her private server issue. “with hillary clinton, she had to own the server thing,” cuomo said. “it was wrong. we heard from all the people around her that it was wrong, she shouldn’t have done it, it was poorly thought out. it wasn’t enough. why?” epshteyn responded that they’re not the same thing. “and hillary clinton — there’s no equivalency. hillary clinton did something illegal. she broke the law.” they continued: chris cuomo: she did not do anything illegal. boris epshteyn: yes, she did. cuomo: james comey’s a liar, too? epshteyn: he said she shouldn’t be prosecuted. he did say she acted carelessly, and as a lawyer, if you look at all the particulars of bringing that case, there was a case to bring. and he said so, too. cuomo: no, he didn’t. he said there’s no case that could be brought, there’s nothing prosecutable about it. he just said it in his report. he said it wasn’t a close call. never mind the fact that even the fbi director himself stated that it is a “felony to mishandle classified information either intentionally or in a grossly negligent way, or a second statute making it a misdemeanor to knowingly remove classified information from appropriate systems or storage facilities.” isn’t that exactly what hillary clinton did? comey even said that she was “extremely careless” – in other words, grossly negligent – in her handling of classified information. and everyone knows that she had some 13 different mobile devices in addition to her private home server, which had on it classified information.   the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      cnn on hillary’s email crimes: “she did not do anything illegal” [video]      
__label__1 while hillary clinton’s “deplorables” comment was “inartful,” the former meet the press host david gregory said that it “may have been accurate” based on surveys and anecdotal evidence. in an interview, cnn host chris cuomo and david gregory were discussing how even though trump is a racist – based on his comments of muslims and illegal immigrants, and his “accepting” support from the kkk and david duke – and a sexist – based on his comments in the past about women – the polls are showing a shocking level of support for him. cuomo asked gregory, “does that tell you that people who know still don’t care?” here’s how he responded: “well, i think there’s an element of that. i mean, i don’t know that we can back that up by the data, but i do think just, look, anybody looks at a politician and says, ‘look, i don’t agree with everything, but i still support them.’ i think there’s people who willfully ignore certain things that trump says and focus on what they like about him. i think that’s true. “i think hillary clinton is in a posture — and you saw it in that answer which i thought was revealing — first of all, she wants to sidestep the fact that she did impugn a lot of trump voters in a way that was inartful, but it may have been based — it may have been accurate in certain — based on some of the surveys that we’ve seen about attitudes of trump supporters and other anecdotal information that we have. but, you know, her whole slogan rhetorically is we’re ‘stronger together,’ and that was not an example of that when she was in that fundraiser. “there she’s saying, ‘no, i’m going to speak out against hateful speech, about the fact that he’s a birther, that david duke is behind him.’ i mean, i think this is her getting a little bit more aggressive. i think this is a preview of the kind of hillary clinton that we’ll see during aspects of these presidential debates.” i don’t doubt that some of trump’s supporters choose not to focus on certain things that he says, but i don’t they’re “willfully ignoring” those things. besides, even if they were “willfully ignoring” the controversial stuff that trump has said, what about hillary clinton’s supporters? are they really any different? they willfully ignore all the scandalous and criminal behavior that’s inextricably tied to their presidential choice. i agree that trump has come across as brash, especially in the earlier part of his campaign, but actions speak louder than words. has trump committed the same level of crimes and been involved in the same level of corruption as the clinton family?   the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      former meet the press host david gregory says hillary’s “deplorables” comment is actually accurate [video]      
__label__1 trump supporters not only come in all shapes, colors, and sizes, they come from all around, even outside the united states. at mount royal university in calgary, alberta – that’s in canada for those of our readers who are gary johnson supporters…(just kidding!) – student matt linder was wearing a red trump hat with the campaign’s slogan “make america great again” on the front. even though they’re canadian, he and his friend both happen to be very interested in american politics, and are both supporters of donald trump. but other students felt their safe space severely violated by this red hat, with one zoe slusar demanding that he remove it, because “it’s hate language on campus.” heat street reported on the incident: “you’re not allowed to share hate language at a university,” slusar shouted at linder. “make america great again means make america all for white people, no immigrants, no people of different sexual orientations. “you’ve got to take the hat off or i am going to write the president of the university,” she continues. “it’s not allowed. it’s hate language on campus.” the video ends when another man (presumably a student) snatches the hat from linder’s head and absconds with it. slusar left this description on her facebook page, but it has since been deleted: today i got into an altercation with a guy wearing a “make america great again” hat. i went up and asked him if he would take the hat off, explaining a university should be a safe space. it was impossible to communicate to him why wearing a hat in support of a movement grown on the seeds of racism, bigotry and exclusion of diversity (sexual and cultural) could make some people afraid. people came out of the woodwork around us to support the hat, and after insulting me, they began filming my “crazy” behaviour at asking him to not wear the hat on campus. the video was posted and i made the mistake of reading the comments. i am so deeply saddened… i don’t want to draw anymore attention to the dysfunctional pawns that are being used by a system of power to oppress others. i do want to state that i stand by my belief that every space, but especially university spaces, should be made to make everyone feel safe. we need to seriously change our culture. we need to equally support and express movements and gestures of inclusive acceptance. i walked outside after the altercation, which ended up involving security and more concern for someone’s “private property” then about anti-oppression and overt racism, feeling totally hopeless. only to find the anti-abortion group posing with their graphic images and slogans of “sin”. but… beside them was a group of courageous and beautiful humans, holding signs of “we support your choice” and kindly warning oncoming students about the graphic images so they could be avoided. (thank you aalayna spence, nathan lawley and crew.) it makes me cry that there will always be battles of “right” and “wrong”… there will always be opposing parties… unfortunately for many people life does not exist without fear of oppression, violence or attack. but there are some warriors, who are not too tired. some humans who want anyone being attacked (be it blatant or subtle) to know they are equally being a supported. i’m ready to make some noise yyc. i’m ready for some loud af language of love. that is the only thing that might have a chance of helping the world. so be a warrior and express your support for those who are attacked everyday because of who they are. #peace she seems to be a walking contradiction. she wants everyone to “be a warrior and express your support for those who are attacked everyday because of who they are.” but that’s exactly what she did to the trump supporter student. she attacked him, because of who he was. and not only that, she attacked him based on stereotypes created by the media of trump and his supporters. the incident was caught on camera:     the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      student blasted for wearing trump hat: “it’s hate language on campus!” [video]      
__label__1 from the daily caller news foundation: a total of 205 clinton foundation donors whose corporations and foundations collectively contributed $216 million since 2009, were awarded the most coveted invitations in the nation’s capital: prestigious seats at one or more white house state dinners, according to a daily caller news foundation investigation. at least 15 of the clinton foundation’s corporate donors — representing $47 million in contributions — were able to win invitations to two or more official state dinners. significantly, the decision makers who authorized the special invitations were not at the white house at all, but were ensconced in the department state’s office of protocol. the protocol office, chosen by former secretary of state hillary clinton, are filled solely with long-time clinton loyalists. despite the democratic presidential nominee’s departure from the department of state in 2013, all of the top officeholders in the protocol office throughout obama’s two terms have been senior staffers who served in either former president bill clinton’s white house or in hillary’s senate and 2008 presidential campaigns. critics of the foundation worry dennis cheng — who served as clinton’s protocol deputy chief and later went directly to the clinton foundation as its chief fundraiser — could have “walked away” with valuable donor lists compiled by the office. after cheng left the department of state, he raised a record quarter billion dollars while at the foundation. he is now hillary’s national fundraiser, leading her presidential bid to raise $2 billion. as a result, the daily beast once called him, “hillary clinton’s $2 billion money man.” if cheng shared confidential information with the foundation, he may have violated a special “memorandum of understanding” (mou) signed by the foundation and the obama transition team in november 2008. the mou warned of avoiding “potential or actual conflict of interest.” cheng also could run afoul of a 18 usc 208, a federal statute that “prohibits an executive branch employee from participating personally and substantially in a particular government matter that will affect his own financial interests,” including those of a prospective employer or a family member. “how much of the mailing list and contact information cheng got at protocol, migrated over to the clinton foundation,” asked charles ortel a wall street investor and an outspoken critic of the clinton foundation. “we don’t yet how much of this extraordinarily valuable contact information as it walked out the front door either in dennis cheng’s personal cell phone, or on a contact list that might have been emailed.” he said in an interview with thedcnf. neither the foundation nor hillary’s presidential campaign responded to inquiries about potential conflicts of interest surrounding cheng. bill boasted in a tuesday cnn interview that foundation donors never benefited from any department of state action, asserting, “to the best of my knowledge, nobody ever got anything from the state department because they supported the clinton foundation.” yet, official white house dinners are among the most glamorous and exclusive venues in washington, d.c., and the competition to secure an invitation is fierce. guests not only can mingle with a head of state and their closest advisors, but they also offer privileged access to the president, top white house staff and many cabinet members. former u.s. attorney joseph digenova, who prosecuted corruption cases in washington, d.c., told thedcnf the white house dinners weren’t only benefits, but amounted to the “selling of access.” “the obvious connection between donations and access to big, white house state dinners is very important,” he said in an interview with thedcnf.  “it was clearly a reward to donors, something they got as a result of giving money to the clinton foundation,” he stated. digenova was u.s. attorney for the district of columbia and was appointed an independent counsel concerning the clinton passport disclosure case. “we are looking into cheng’s relationship between the state department and the foundation and the political donor class,” former u.s. attorney matthew whitaker told thedcnf. whitaker is the executive director of the ethics watchdog group, the foundation for accountability & civic trust (fact). “cheng is the person in the middle of this situation. he had substantial input as to who was invited, who got seated where,” he said. “i would say cheng’s a key figure — really a shadowy figure — in this whole thing,” whitaker added. “it’s very obvious to me that people were giving to the foundation, not only because they perceived they could get access to the state department, but it now appears they were giving in order to get access to state dinners at the white house,” he told thedcnf. fact has been trying to obtain the email traffic between cheng and the clinton foundation under the freedom of information act. the group initially filed an foia request in february 2015, but department of state officials are refusing to release any of the emails before the presidential election. “they have been stonewalling us and not responsive and now they’re telling us that we probably won’t get it until mid-to-late november,” whitaker said. he served as the us attorney for the southern district of iowa from 2004-2009. the protocol office has been stacked from the very beginning with clinton veterans. when cheng served as deputy chief of the protocol office, his boss was chief capricia marshall who, at age 32, served as the white house social secretary for hillary when bill was president. after cheng left in 2011, his replacement was natalie jones, who was hillary’s mid-atlantic finance director for her 2008 presidential bid. jones was joined by mark walsh, hillary’s lgbt “outreach director” from her 2008 campaign. peter selfridge succeeded marshall in june 2014 as the chief of protocol and is the current head of the office. he served in the scheduling and advance office at former president bill clinton’s white house. one of the most revealing illustration of cheng’s continuing contact with the the protocol office after he joined the clinton foundation is in email exchanges. in a march 8, 2012 email from marshall to jones, cheng and hillary’s deputy chief of staff, huma abedin, the chief happily identifies foundation donors who were to attend the march 14, 2012 state dinner for british prime minister david cameron. “invited to state dinner,” marshall informed the group. two of those invited included clinton democratic fundraiser gov. terry mcauliffe, who gave between $100,000 to $250,000, and fred eychaner, who committed $25 million to the foundation. “nice,” replies abedin. although the 2008 mou explicitly sought to build a wall between the foundation and clinton’s official business, cheng felt it was appropriate to later invite abedin to a clinton foundation dinner that included foreign nationals. in a june 11, 2012 email, he urges abedin to come to little rock for the dinner. “attached is list of attendees for tomorrow night’s clinton foundation dinner,” he wrote abedin. among those attending was recep ozkan, a turkish national who donated between $500,000 to $1 million to the clinton foundation. ozkan was the liaison for fethullah gulen, a secretive turkish cleric who allegedly was behind the failed july 15 coup attempt against the turkish government of president recep erdogan. erdogan filed papers with the u.s. government seeking the extradition of gulen, according to tuesday reports. also attending the dinner was victor pinchuk, the ukrainian tycoon who married the daughter of ukrainian strongman leonid kuchma, who was considered a corrupt leader during his years in office. the email was obtained by citizens united, a conservative group, under the freedom of information act. one of the most notorious clinton foundation donors to attend a white house dinner was rajat gupta, a long-time personal friend of bill’s who was convicted of insider trading. he served two years in a federal penitentiary. gupta was the first foreign-born managing director at mckinsey & company and reportedly hired chelsea clinton for her first job. without any experience, he paid her a six figure salary. gupta attended the dinner for the indian prime minister in 2009. ortel claims the pattern of awarding government perks to donors began in the 1990s during bill’s first term at the white house.  at the time, clinton and his aides rented out the lincoln bedroom to 66 campaign contributors and offered seats on air force one to 56 contributors. “to see the pattern, you really have to go back to when they were in control of the white house, the first time and they clearly demonstrated the propensity to rent out the lincoln bedroom, to sell seats on air force one,” ortel told thedcnf. “so this was an old game.” rep. marsha blackburn, the tennessee republican congresswoman who is vice-chair of the house energy and commerce committee and leading a congressional investigation into the clinton foundation, told thedcnf, “this is further evidence of the clinton’s ‘pay to play’ mentality. the state dinners provide incredible opportunities to meet our government’s highest ranking officials and clinton foundation donors were able to get special access simply because they stroked a check.” “the quid pro quo is astonishing and it begs the question of whether the clintons are beneath selling anything,” blackburn charged. lloyd blankfein, goldman sachs’ chairman and ceo, attended one of the hottest state dinners — a january 19, 2011 white house state dinner for former chinese president hu jintao. his company donated $1 to $5 million to the foundation, and its goldman philanthropy fund gave an additional $250,000 to $500,000, according to the clinton foundation website. but that wasn’t the only contributions to bill and hillary. the company also gave the couple $2.25 million for 12 speeches before goldman sachs venues. brian moynihan, bank of america’s ceo and chairman, attended the may 19, 2010 state dinner toasting felipe calderon, mexico’s former president. the bank of america foundation donated between $500,000 to $1 million to the clinton foundation, and the bank of america corporation contributed between $100,000 to $250,000. but bank of america also paid more than $1 million for four speeches to both bill and hillary. the clinton foundation donors invited to more than one state dinner were: honeywell, ge, dreamworks, pepsico, morgan stanley, coca cola, dow, boeing, intel, ups, comcast, ibm and the blackstone group. microsoft and the ford foundation were invited to three state dinners. j.t. mastranadi, political director of the citizens united, said his organization’s conclusion was, “regardless of where you happened to be employed at any given time – the clinton state department or the clinton foundation – the top priority was always donor maintenance.” thedcnf contacted the clinton foundation and hillary’s presidential campaign about a wide range of questions regarding the state dinners and the foundation. neither responded. to see the full list of clinton foundation donor attendees to all 12 white house state dinners, click here.  the views

__label__0 well over 80 million people tuned in to see hillary clinton and donald trump face off, setting a new record in the sixty year history of televised presidential debates. according to nielsen, the debate averaged a total of 84 million viewers across 13 of the tv channels that carried it live. many millions also watched the debate via live streams on the web. nielsen's 84 million total counts people who watched via traditional tv channels at home. people who watched the debate at parties, bars, restaurants, and offices were not counted. neither were c-span viewers. this means the actual total audience is even higher. on the tv side, cnn and other cable news channels saw big increases over past election years. so did the broadcast networks. nbc had the biggest audience overall, partly because "nbc nightly news" anchor lester holt was the moderator of the debate. upwards of 18 million people watched the debate on nbc. abc drew 13.5 million viewers, cbs drew 12.1 million, fox news drew 11.4 million, cnn drew 9.9 million, the fox broadcast network drew 5.5 million, and msnbc drew 4.9 million. the debate was also a hit on spanish language television, attracting 2.5 million viewers on univision and 1.8 million on telemundo. trump may have been the ratings magnet, but clinton may have been the beneficiary of the ratings bump. by tuesday there was a media consensus that clinton had prevailed in the debate. the debate viewership number to beat was 80.6 million, set back in 1980, when jimmy carter and ronald reagan debated just once before the election. more recently, the first obama-romney debate in 2012 averaged 67 million viewers. detailed nielsen data confirms that viewership stayed high the entire time. contrary to some speculation, there was not a big drop-off after the first 30 minutes of the 98-minute debate. the vast majority of viewers kept watching until the very end, a fact that the clinton campaign celebrated on tuesday. earlier story: ratings expectations for first trump-clinton debate are sky high anticipation for the clinton-trump meeting had been mounting for months. television industry executives were anticipating a total audience somewhere between 80 and 100 million. there will be two more debates between the candidates in october. on monday night twitter said the first face-off was the "most tweeted debate ever." given the rapid growth of streaming options, it was almost certainly the most streamed debate ever, as well. various live streams on youtube together registered more than 2.5 million simultaneous viewers. live streams on other sites also reached millions of people. on both twitter and facebook, trump was a livelier subject than clinton. twitter said the "final share of conversation around the candidates on stage" was 62% for trump and 38% for clinton. on facebook, the results were even more lopsided, with trump earning 79% share of conversation and clinton having the remaining 21%. being talked about isn't necessarily a good thing for a candidate. most commentators gave clinton the edge over trump after the debate. still, the post-debate coverage on tv focused on trump, partly because of surprising and confounding comments he made on stage. cnn's reality check team investigated 26 claims made by clinton and trump and found that trump made a greater number of misleading statements.      debate breaks record as most-watched in u.s. history      
__label__0 (cnn)newt gingrich thinks the current clinton running for president is nothing like the last one. "i worked with bill clinton," gingrich tweeted tuesday. "bill clinton and i got a lot done -- welfare reform, balancing the budget. hillary clinton is no bill clinton." gingrich also took issue with how hillary clinton pointed to the economic success of 1990s during monday's first presidential debate as an indicator for how her presidency would be. "if hillary clinton is going to cite 1990s she needs to drop tax increasing, red tape increasing left wing policies. she is opposite of 90s," he tweeted. for gingrich, a supporter of donald trump, it was praise for an old adversary -- done at the expense of clinton's wife and the current democratic presidential nominee. during his tenure as house speaker in the 1990s, gingrich was frequently at odds with bill clinton during an acrimonious period of a divided washington that included a government shut down. the tweet came the day after the first debate between hillary clinton and trump, and it called to mind a famous quip from a previous debate. at the 1988 vice presidential debate, democratic nominee lloyd bentsen fired off an indelible retort to the republican dan quayle, who had invoked john f. kennedy to defend his qualifications for the office. "senator, i served with jack kennedy. i knew jack kennedy. jack kennedy was a friend of mine," bentsen said, while staring down quayle.

(cnn)cook political report national editor amy walter said undecided voters are different this election cycle because they're "absolutely clued in" with who the candidates of both major parties are -- and they still don't like what they see. "normally what you see in those groups, people who are undecided, they're undecided because they really haven't been paid much attention," walter told cnn's party people podcast hosts kevin madden and mary katherine ham in a recent conversation. walter, who also worked for former democratic rep. marjorie margolies mezvinsky, said undecided voters sounded like children trying to avoid hopping into a cold pool. gop policy guru: trump can't 'fake his way through 90 minutes' "here, these undecided voters are absolutely clued-in and they're like that feeling we all had in school when you had to jump into the cold pool in first hour p.e., and you're like, 'i don't want to get in there, i don't want to jump in there! i know i'm going to have to get in.' so, they are undecided because they don't want to make a choice, not because they don't know about their choices," she said. walter said for the first time that she can remember, she's having trouble trusting the data that's coming from the campaign trail, and that undecided voters are struggling to choose between the lesser of two evils. voters say this is the ultimate 'lesser of two evils' election "what i hear from these groups, is just this idea of like 'you know, i don't know if i trust hillary clinton,'" she said. "one woman said, 'i don't trust hillary clinton on terrorism' -- to sort of get to your point of instability in the world -- 'but donald trump is going to get us into world war iii.' so, that's why people are like 'i'd rather cut my arm off than have this election, because that's what you're making me choose from.'" walter, who also previously worked for cnn, described how the political polarization between different demographic groups, in particular white voters and whether they have a college degree, can't be blamed entirely on donald trump. "it has been a dramatic shift," walter said. "you can't blame that all on one candidate who had a great rally. this has been a steady movement that way." to hear how walter got her start in politics and more, listen to cnn's "party people," a new podcast where a pair of conservative cnn contributors talk to influential voices about the future of conservative politics and the republican party. get cnn's "party people" podcast at cnn, stitcher, tuneinradio or itunes.       walter: 2016's undecided voters would rather cut off their arms 'than have this election'      
__label__0 white plains, new york (cnn)in hillary clinton's eyes, donald trump knows he lost monday night. clinton, speaking with reporters on her plane, threw serious shade at trump hours after the two met for the first presidential debate at hofstra univeristy. the former secretary of state gloated that she had a great night and said trump, who complained about his microphone after the debate, knew he lost. as she walked away from reporters, clinton was asked about trump's complaints. unable to resist, she turned around and said glibly, "anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night." after monday's debate, trump said that his microphone on the stage was "defective." "my mic was defective within the room," he told reporters. "i wonder, was that on purpose?" in the eyes of most political experts and post-debate polls, clinton got the best of trump at monday night's debate, using the 90-minute contest to drop considerable opposition research on the republican nominee. clinton looked at times gleeful on the debate stage as trump repeatedly interrupted her and often took the bait on her attack lines. afterward, her top aides were using words like "unhinged" and "deranged" to describe trump's performance. "we had a great, great time last night," clinton said. "so i am looking forward to the next debate and the one after that." clinton, though, left the door open about whether trump would show up. "well, i'm going to show up," clinton said. "he gets to decide what he wants to do. ... if i'm the only person on stage, well, you know, i'm the only person on stage."       hillary clinton swipes at donald trump over microphone complaint      
__label__0 (cnn)texas sen. ted cruz is willing to lend a hand to donald trump, he said tuesday. asked by conservative radio host hugh hewitt whether he'd be willing to campaign for trump or help with his debate prep, the former trump nemesis was on board. he formally endorsed the republican nominee in a facebook post last friday. "i am happy to help. i have conveyed that to them. i will do whatever i can to defeat hillary clinton," cruz said, adding that he is equally focused on preserving a republican majority in the senate. "i'm going to do everything i can to urge conservatives to come out and vote, even if they may not be thrilled at the candidates on the ballot. i'm urging them to come out and vote anyway, because the consequences of staying home, i think, are really quite significant." trump's former rival praised his "strong" debate performance, calling clinton "tired" and "formulaic." "i thought it was a very strong debate. i thought hillary did not have a good performance. i think throughout the night, she was tired, she was formulaic. the entire debate from hillary was more washington as usual. and every proposal she advanced was another big government solution that isn't working, that is failing. and i thought donald had the strongest debate performance he's had in this election cycle," the texas senator said.       ted cruz 'happy to help' donald trump campaign

__label__0 washington (cnn)the american-led military coalition against isis said tuesday that a final laboratory test of the weapon isis fired at a us-iraqi base in northern iraq last week did not contain a mustard agent as earlier believed. col. john dorrian, a spokesperson for the anti-isis coalition, tweeted that "definitive" lab results show the munitions that hit qayyara air base on september 20 was not a chemical weapon. initial field tests of what has been described as either a rocket or artillery shell did indeed test positive for the chemical weapon and us personnel were required to undergo decontamination. last week, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, gen. joseph dunford, told the senate armed services committee that "we assess it to be a sulfur mustard blister agent" when asked about the attack. military officials had told cnn that a second test of the weapon had produced negative results while a third lab test was inconclusive. the most recent test announced by dorrian represents the final test of the weapon. a us defense official told cnn that isis has carried out dozens of chemical weapons attacks against civilians and us allies in northern iraq and syria, and that the us military considers itself to be operating in a chemical environment. the official added that while the latest test of a chemical weapon proved negative, he said he expected such attacks to happen in the future. dunford said the military has targeted over 30 isis installations involved in the production of chemical weapons. us navy capt. jeff davis, a pentagon spokesman, told reporters monday that the us has issued 50,000 gas masks to the iraqi forces in order to counter isis chemical weapons attacks. barbara starr contributed to this report      us: isis did not use mustard agent in base attack      
__label__0 washington (cnn)house speaker paul ryan dodged tuesday when asked about donald trump's criticism of a former miss universe, trying instead to put the focus on hillary clinton following the first presidential debate. trump on fox news tuesday defended making critical remarks about former miss universe alicia machado's weight gain back in the 1990s. the republican nominee said she had "gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem." ryan, who has been critical of trump's comments in the past, did not bite on this one, however. "i'm not going to get into the who said what this morning on a talk show because i didn't see it," ryan said. "i think this debate, i think people, met their expectations, and i think hillary gave a very polished, well-rehearsed status quo defense and i think donald trump gave a unique donald trump response to the status quo," ryan added. but gleeful democrats, clearly happy with monday night's outcome, latched on to trump's machado comments. "he's just repulsive. i mean, he really has no filter, he has no comprehension. he engages in rhetoric that is insulting to women. he doubled down this morning," said rep. debbie wasserman schultz, the former democratic national committee chairwoman. "someone needs to remind him that it's the 21st century and we've evolved long past it's what women's looks and women's substance that matters. and we're about to elect the first woman president, so we'll show it to him that way." house republicans, whose own fortunes could depend on how well trump does on election day, gave him mixed reviews. rep. mark sanford of south carolina said there was a "sophomoric element" to trump's repeated interruptions of clinton onstage. rep. charlie dent, one of a handful of remaining moderate republicans, was critical of trump's bragging about not paying taxes. but rep. tom cole, a close ally of ryan's, said trump merely needed to clear the bar for looking presidential. "i think actually trump had a pretty good night," cole said. "neither one of them landed a knockout punch, but i think he needed to pass the bar to be presidential. and i think he did."       paul ryan defends trump, dodges on machado comment      
__label__0 (cnn)new jersey gov. chris christie was informed about the traffic problems at the george washington bridge in 2013 as they were happening, according to the testimony tuesday from a former port authority executive. while at ground zero during a 9/11 memorial event on september 11, 2013, bill baroni, the former port authority deputy executive director, and david wildstein, the port authority director of interstate capital projects, had a discussion with christie about the traffic issues, wildstein testified tuesday in federal court. the testimony is part of the trial for christie's former deputy chief of staff, bridget anne kelly, and baroni, who have both pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges in connection to the lane closures that caused the traffic problems, an incident that has come to be known by some as "bridgegate." christie has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing or involvement with the lane closures, and he has never been charged with any crime related to the handling of the incident. at an unrelated event tuesday, christie publicly said his version of events has not changed and denied any wrong "i had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments," he said. "i had no role in authorizing it. i had no knowledge of it and there has been no evidence ever put forward that i did." at a lengthy news conference on january 9, 2014, a day after the revelation that an aide and adviser had a role in the lane closures, christie said he "had no contact with david wildstein in a long time, a long time, well before the election." related: bridgegate trial: what to know "you know, i could probably count on one hand the number of conversations i've had with david since he worked at the port authority," christie said then. "i did not interact with david." wildstein said in court that baroni told christie, "governor, i have to tell you there's a tremendous amount of traffic in fort lee this morning, major traffic jams." wilstein said baroni had a sarcastic tone during the conversation. the lane closures began two days prior on september 9. "you'll be pleased to know that mayor (mark) sokolich is having trouble getting his telephone calls returned," baroni continued, according to wildstein. wildstein testified that christie replied, "i imagine he wouldn't be getting his calls returned." sokolich had not endorsed chris christie in his re-election bid. previous testimony during this case illustrated an administration policy of "radio silence" the governor's office and the port authority implemented. baroni then informed christie that wildstein was monitoring the traffic in fort lee. later in the conversation, christie reiterated that the port authority was to have no contact with sokolich. the lane closures lasted four days. editor's note: the headline and text in this story have been updated to reflect language from the actual testimony about what the witness said christie was told at the time of the lane closures. cnn's tom kludt and tal kopan contributed to this report.      former official testifies: christie told about bridge traffic problems as they happened      
__label__0 new york (cnn)after 30 years in the spotlight, hillary clinton finally found the balance on gender that has bedeviled her throughout her career during the debate at hofstra monday night. demonstrate power, command of the issues and the ability to shred your opponent -- all while seeming (just) likeable enough. monday night's faceoff with donald trump could have been heralded as another historic first for women. but clinton made no mention of a glass ceiling. there was no self-congratulatory nod to the fact that she was the first female nominee of a major party to take that stage before as many as 100 million people. she wore red, a power color, but with a feminine cut that looked anything but severe. she was smooth and measured; flicking subtly to her gender with a quick mention of granddaughter charlotte right off the top, but then didn't dwell on it. she didn't lecture. she smiled (a lot) — even as he slid into his role of interrupter-in-chief. before monday night's debate, all the attention was on which donald trump would appear -- the restrained candidate or the flame-thrower of primary days. but it was the former secretary of state who pulled off the more fascinating performance -- taking command of the stage, dominating trump on a wide array of issues, luring him into ill-advised digressions about the source of his wealth and whether he pays federal taxes. trump complains about debate mic in an interesting strategic move, she waited until the very end of the debate to throw her sharpest dart by raising his past descriptions of women "as pigs, slobs and dogs" and his criticism of weight gain by 1996 miss universe alicia machado. trump shook his head, demanding where she had gotten her information (it's on tape); but then didn't seem to have an effective response. instead he wandered off into a digression about rosie o'donnell, the meanness of clinton's ads, and the notion that he had planned to mention bill clinton's infidelities -- but was holding back the instinct to say "something extremely rough to hillary, to her family." "i said to myself, 'i can't do it. i just can't do it,' trump said. and then the debate was over. one critical task for clinton in the coming weeks is activating and energizing female voters, particularly moderate republican and undecided women turned off by trump. her team clearly felt her light touch gender strategy -- provoking trump but not complaining about her treatment -- worked monday night. her campaign chairman john podesta told reporters before leaving new york that trump's "constant interruption of her probably was reminiscent of the way a lot of women feel about bullies in their lives. he added, "i thought it was kind of unbecoming and he couldn't stop himself." the campaign followed up with a gut-punching web video showing trump's comments on machado's weight and the nickname she said he adopted for the latina contest winner: "miss housekeeping." who is alicia machado? in a gaggle with reporters en route to north carolina, clinton brushed off trump's interruptions, taking a page from carly fiorina's playbook when trump made comments during the gop primary about her face. "i think his demeanor, his temperament, his behavior on the stage could be seen by everybody," clinton told reporters who had asked about his frequent interruptions. the strategy? let women judge for themselves. was she fearful of future mentions of bill clinton's infidelity? "he can run his campaign however he chooses, and, you know, i will continue to talk about what i want to do for the american people," she replied. as the race has tightened in recent weeks, trump's aides believe it is in part because they are making gains among suburban women, particularly in states like colorado and pennsylvania, who like trump's childcare plan and his recent policy speeches. how trump's performance affects that calculus remains to be seen. but he seemed to have walked into clinton's trap on fox & friends tuesday morning when he defended his comments about machado's weight. "i know that person, that person was a miss universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. the worst, the absolute worst," trump said, later adding, "she was the winner and you know, she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem." clearly trump isn't afraid to double down on his past comments about women, even when his advisers have tried to steer him toward more substantive policy issues. and clinton is going to let that play out. cnn's dan merica contributed to this report.      how hillary clinton found her stride on gender      
__label__0 washington (cnn)the donald trump-rosie o'donnell feud is back in the 2016 spotlight. o'donnell slammed trump on twitter monday night after he resurrected their longtime feud during the first presidential debate, saying that comments he made about the comedian and tv host in the past — including calling her a "pig" — were justified. declaring her support for clinton, o'donnell tweeted, "he will never be president" and then later called on people to "shame the donald." trump's comments on o'donnell came after clinton accused trump of sexism during the debate, saying, "this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs." "hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. some of it i said in entertainment, some of it said to somebody who has been very vicious to me, rosie o'donnell," trump responded. "i said very tough things to her and i think everybody would agree she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her." the clinton campaign launched an ad called "mirrors" last week that features young girls looking in the mirror as trump insults various women. the spot includes comments trump made about o'donnell in 2006, calling the former host of "the view," a "slob" with a "fat ugly face," and comments trump made in a 2007 interview with larry king where called o'donnell a "pig." trump slammed the ad as "inappropriate" and accused clinton of misrepresenting his views. "it's inappropriate. it's not nice, but she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me — many of which are absolutely untrue," trump continued. "they're untrue and they're misrepresentations and i will tell you this, lester, it's not nice and i don't deserve that." trump told larry king in 2007 that his relationship with o'donnell prior to their 2006 feud "was ok," but o'donnell "was never a friend" and added that she "ate like a pig" while attending his 1993 wedding to now ex-wife, marla maples. "she came to my wedding. she ate like a pig. and — i mean, seriously, the wedding cake was — was — it was like missing in action. i couldn't stand there," trump said. "i didn't like it, but a particular woman wanted her at the wedding — marla. i think they were friendly or something. and so i said, 'what's rosie o'donnell doing here?'" some celebrities came to o'donnell's defense monday night. "mess with my girl rosie and you're messing with me!" madonna tweeted. other celebrities, including lena dunham, seth macfarlane, leslie jones and andy cohen also chimed in. trump's feud with o'donnell first came into the spotlight of the 2016 campaign during the first republican primary debate in august 2015 when fox news host megyn kelly asked trump about past comments he made about women, calling them "fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals." "only rosie o'donnell," trump quipped before unleashing attacks against kelly and sparking a months-long feud between the two.       rosie o'donnell responds to donald trump debate attack      
__label__0 washington (cnn)ten judges on a powerful federal appeals court in washington heard more than six hours of arguments tuesday concerning a cornerstone of president barack obama's legacy on the environment: the clean power plan. the environmental protection agency's plan is meant to reduce climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions by targeting existing coal-fired and natural gas power plants with a goal of reduce greenhouse emissions up to 32% by 2030. it would require states to meet specific carbon emission reduction standards based on their individual energy consumption, and it includes an incentive program for states to get a head start on meeting standards on early deployment of renewable energy. dozens of lawyers from the government, industry and public interest groups packed the us court of appeals for the dc circuit, to hear the divisive case that comes just weeks before a heated presidential election and illustrates how a president's picks for the lower court might impact his own agenda. the plan is currently frozen because last february, the supreme court voted to delay implementation until the appeals process could play out. opponents to the plan claim that the epa went too far under the law to push the rule. judge brett m. kavanaugh at one point questioned epa's authority. "this is a huge case," he said and noted that it could "fundamentally" transform the industry. kavanaugh said the administration's policy is "laudable" but questioned under the separation of powers whether congress, and not the epa, had to speak clearly on the issue. judge thomas b. griffith chimed in asking, "why isn't this debate going on in the floor of the senate?" rather than before a panel of judges. but judge patricia a. millet reiterated at one point that the supreme court "has already said" that the epa has the authority to regulate in the area. other judges questioned whether by 2030, the rule would be any more transformative to the coal industry, for example, than market forces would be. judge david s. tatel asked whether the agency was simply "invoking existing authority." while the morning session in court was dedicated to statutory arguments, in the afternoon the court heard arguments concerning whether it was unconstitutional. the challengers' constitutional arguments did not appear to to get much traction with the judges. on one side is the epa, 18 states, some power companies and environmental and public health groups who argue in briefs that the rule will "secure critically important reductions" in carbon dioxide emissions from what are by far "the largest emitters in the united states -- fossil-fuel-fired power plants." they argue that the emissions "pose a monumental threat to american's health and welfare by driving long-lasting changes in our climate leading to an array of severe negative effects." the plan is considered important for the us to meet goals set out in a climate treaty signed in paris last december. on the other side are nearly two dozen states, electric utilities, coal mining companies and the chamber of commerce. they say the rule exceeds the agency's statutory authority and goes beyond the bounds set by the constitution. "epa's audacious assertion of authority in this rule is more far-reaching than any previous effort by the agency," lawyers for the opposing states argued in court papers. they say that the reduction requirements "can be met only by shutting down hundreds of coal-fired plants, limiting the use of others, and requiring construction and operation of other types of facilities preferred by epa." in a statement back in february, white house press secretary josh earnest said,. "the clean power plan is based on a strong legal and technical foundation, gives states the time and flexibility they need to develop tailored, cost-effective plans to reduce their emissions, and will deliver better air quality, improved public health, clean energy investment and jobs across the country." by the end of the day, after more than a dozen lawyers had approached the podium, and judge karen henderson acknowledged everyone's long day. "we've all been through a marathon," she said. court filled with obama appointees during complex arguments before a multi-member court is dangerous to try to determine -- based on questions posed at oral arguments -- how a judge will ultimately rule. it's worth noting however, that tuesday's case comes before an appellate court that has been transformed during the obama administration. before obama took office the appeals court tilted toward conservative appointees with six judges nominated by a republican president and three nominated by a democratic president. there were also two vacancies. currently, the active judges on the court consist of four gop appointees and seven democratic appointees. in 2013, obama placed four judges on the court, three of them immediately after the senate changed its filibuster rules. tuesday's case was heard by all the active members of the court except for chief judge merrick garland who has recused himself from hearing cases because he has been nominated to the supreme court. "the party of an appointing president surely makes a difference in some types of cases -- environmental for example -- more than others," said russell wheeler, a visiting fellow at the brookings institute. "when the full court meets is when the party of appointing president is likely to matter most because the great majority of decisions are made by three-judge panels, randomly drawn and not necessarily reflective of the overall composition of the court." because the supreme court is currently at a reduced strength of eight the appeals court opinion could be the last word on the subject. a 4-4 tie at the supreme court would mean the justices automatically uphold the lower court's opinion. elizabeth wydra of the progressive constitutional accountability center says that the appeals court is "exhibit a" of why judicial nominations are crucial to a president's legacy. "president obama was able to put several brilliant legal minds on the bench, who are much more likely to follow the law where it leads rather than accept the extreme conservative deregulatory agenda pushed by this case," she said.       appeals court hears high-stakes challenge to obama's clean power plan

__label__0 raleigh, north carolina (cnn)as soon as the first debate of the 2016 presidential election was over, both donald trump and hillary clinton were quick to claim victory. but by the next morning, one of them had become far less cheerful. just hours after clinton and trump clashed on stage at hofstra university in one of the most highly anticipated political events in modern history, the two presidential nominees took markedly different tones as they reflected on the previous night's debate. clinton and her aides showed all of the outward signs of a team riding high. the democratic nominee boarded her plane at westchester county airport to applause and cheers from her staff. before taking off to raleigh, north carolina, for a campaign rally, a smiling candidate walked to the back of the plane to gloat to reporters about a "great, great" evening. "one of my favorite baseball players growing up, ernie banks, used to get so excited about going to play that he would say, 'lets play two,'" clinton said. "so i am looking forward to the next debate and the one after that." how clinton found her stride on gender and taking a dig at trump's complaint after the debate that he was given a "defective" microphone, clinton quipped: "anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night." and in fact, the republican nominee did not appear to be having a good morning. calling into fox news' "fox & friends" early tuesday, trump rattled off more than one complaint about the debate. his first target was nbc news' lester holt, the moderator of monday night's debate. just hours before, trump had praised holt in the spin room to cnn, saying the newscaster had done a "great job" and was "very fair." those compliments were long gone. "i had some hostile questions," trump said on fox news. "he didn't ask her about the emails at all. he didn't ask her about her scandals. he didn't ask her about the benghazi deal that she destroyed. he didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. there's no question about it." trump was still irritated -- and even conspiratorial -- about his microphone. "my microphone was terrible," trump complained. "i wonder: was it set up that way on purpose?" to top things off, trump unloaded on former miss universe alicia machado, who has alleged that the businessman's disparaging treatment of her had led to eating disorders and depression. with no apparent consideration for the political recklessness of his crude comments, trump once again went after machado's physical appearance, bringing her up on his own. "that person was a miss universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. the worst. the absolute worst," trump said. "she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem. we had a real problem." those remarks could prove to be detrimental for a candidate already struggling with women voters and with the perception that he lacks the temperament to be president. late monday, the clinton campaign released a new video featuring machado. "he'd tell me, 'you look ugly,' or, 'you look fat,'" machado says in the video. "sometimes he'd 'play' with me and say: 'hello, miss piggy,' 'hello, miss housekeeping.'" machado also held a press call tuesday afternoon to respond to trump's comments and express her support for clinton. she told reporters that watching the 2016 election was like a "really bad dream." "i never imagined in 20 years later i will be in this position," she said. "watching this guy again doing stupid things and stupid comments." speaking in raleigh tuesday afternoon, clinton continued to make digs at trump's debate performance, saying it was "very clear that he didn't prepare." "what we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent," she said. "it's unclear exactly what he is saying, but words matter." marguerite scott, a retired 68-year-old woman from cary, north carolina, who attended the raleigh campaign event, said she was struck by trump appearing to lose his composure during the debate. scott lso chastised the gop nominee for his comments tuesday about machado. "men in general should stop objectifying women. if she is fat, that is her business," scott said. "and to put her on blast like that shows what a misogynist person he is." asked what she thought of trump's complaints about a defective microphone, scott responded: "we heard him loudly and clearly, and bigly!" cnn's david wright and dylan byers contributed to this report.      day after debate, clinton gloats and trump fumes      
__label__0 washington (cnn)house majority leader kevin mccarthy told reporters the house will vote this week on a resolution holding bryan pagliano, the former hillary clinton aide who helped set up her private email server, in contempt of congress. house oversight committee chairman jason chaffetz tweeted that he filed a resolution tuesday. the oversight committee approved the gop-led contempt resolution last week along a straight party line. the floor vote is expected to come thursday or friday, according to a senior house gop leadership aide. chaffetz, a utah republican, has argued that previous testimony from another one of clinton's it workers, justin cooper, made it imperative for pagliano to testify. "i explained mr. pagliano was uniquely qualified to provide testimony to help the committee better understand secretary clinton's use of a private email server. this is indisputable," chaffetz said. "i also made clear the committee would consider all options regarding mr. pagliano's failure to appear, including consideration of recommending he be held in contempt." pagliano was first called before the oversight committee last week but did not appear. pagliano pleaded the fifth amendment in a closed-door hearing last year of the house panel investigating the benghazi attacks. pagliano's lawyers last week accused chaffetz of launching a witch hunt. "a subpoena issued by a congressional committee is required by law to serve a valid legislative purpose -- and there is none here. your demand under the present circumstances, that mr. pagliano again assert his constitutional rights in front of video cameras six weeks before the presidential election, betrays a naked political agenda and furthers no valid legislative aim," pagliano's lawyers wrote in a letter to the committee. the clinton campaign said thursday it had not told pagliano whether or not to testify, and blasted the oversight hearings into her private email server. "he made his own decision, but we certainly have not prevailed upon anyone to cooperate with this sham of an inquiry," clinton spokesman brian fallon said. "the career officials at the fbi and the justice department already thoroughly investigated this matter, and closed the case with no further action, and jason chaffetz is abusing his office with this blatantly partisan attempt to hurt hillary clinton's presidential campaign."       house to vote on contempt resolution for former clinton aide this week      
__label__0 washington (cnn)eager to motivate his own base of supporters to vote in this year's contest, president barack obama will begin appearing in more advertising for hillary clinton, the white house said tuesday. speaking a day after the first presidential debate, press secretary josh earnest said obama would ramp up his role in the 2016 race as election day nears. "i think through october, the president will be increasing his involvement in this race, and that doesn't just mean through travel," earnest said. "that also means that the president will feature more prominently in the advertising efforts of secretary clinton and democrats across the country." earnest said the ads would appear on television, radio and online. a message left with the clinton campaign about the spots, including how much money would be spent on them, was not immediately returned. obama has appeared at two campaign stops for clinton, and further stops are expected to be announced in the coming days. both vice president joe biden and first lady michelle obama are making campaign stops for clinton in pennsylvania this week. democrats hope obama can convince the bloc of supporters who backed him in 2008 and 2012 -- comprised of african-americans, young people and women -- to get behind clinton this cycle. while earnest didn't specify tuesday when or where the ads featuring obama would run, aides have identified north carolina, pennsylvania, ohio and florida as states where the president is likely to hold sway. "i think you're going to continue to hear the president warn against complacency," earnest said tuesday. "he'll be looking to maximize the time he is able to make available to support secretary clinton." he said obama would spend "one to two" days per week on the trail for clinton in early october, with a ramp-up possible at the end of the month. but he cautioned against using travel alone as a gauge of obama's engagement. "there are a variety of other ways for the president to get engaged," he said, citing radio interviews and ads. "i think the president will be visible, but that doesn't always include headlining a rally." cnn's dan merica contributed to this report.      obama to appear in clinton ads      
__label__0 washington (cnn)the fbi has asked to examine the cell phones of a small number democratic party staffers as it investigates a possible hack, law enforcement and democratic sources told cnn tuesday. the development comes on the same day homeland security secretary jeh johnson told lawmakers that 18 states have asked for help in warding off cyberattacks on their electronic voting systems. law enforcement officials have reached out to the staffers individually about "imaging" their phones to search for evidence of hacking, such as malware. investigators are still probing whether this attempted hack is part of the original breach of democratic national committee emails -- which is widely thought to be the work of the russian government -- or a new hacking attempt. "our struggle with the russian hackers that we announced in june is ongoing -- as we knew it would be -- and we are choosing not to provide general updates unless personal data or other sensitive information has been accessed or stolen," interim dnc chairwoman donna brazile told cnn. meanwhile, johnson outlined to the senate homeland security committee the concerns states had about defending their voting systems from hackers. "we are seeing a limited number of instances where there have been efforts through cyberintrusions to get into the online presence of various state election agencies," johnson said. law enforcement and election officials said in august that hackers had breached databases for election systems in arizona and illinois. "what we are seeing are efforts to get into voter registration rolls, the identity of registered voters," johnson added. while johnson would not say who was behind the latest hacks, their reveal comes less than a week after the top democrats on congress' intelligence committees blamed russian intelligence agencies for a series of hacks designed to influence the us presidential election. california sen. dianne feinstein and california rep. adam schiff, the ranking members on the senate and house intelligence committees, respectively, released a joint statement thursday blaming russian president vladimir putin and the russian government for the cyberintrusions. "based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the us election," they wrote. russia's suspected role in efforts to hack systems relating to us elections was a major theme in monday's debate between republican nominee donald trump and his democratic opponent, hillary clinton. clinton also faulted the russians for the election-related cyberintrusions while trump said "it could be russia, but it could also be china. it could also be lots of other people. it also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds." asked about the latest hacking reports, schiff told cnn's wolf blitzer on "the situation room" tuesday that it was "very serious business," adding that, "unfortunately, i think we are going to see more of it." schiff called trump's refusal to blame the russians for the cyberintrusions "troubling," saying trump "has essentially become an apologist for the kremlin." "my guess, wolf, is if this guy weighs 400 pounds, he is sitting somewhere in russia right now," schiff added. asked in july whether russia was trying to use cyberattacks to influence us elections, director of national intelligence james clapper said russia believes it is reacting to what it sees as us attempts to destabilize russia. "try to look at things from their vantage, i think. they are paranoid," he told an audience at the aspen forum. "they believe that we are trying to influence political developments in russia and trying to effect change and so their natural response is to retaliate and do unto us as they think we have done unto them," clapper added.       fbi investigating possible hack of democratic party staffer cell phones      
__label__0 washington (cnn)the first presidential debate broke viewing records monday, but a number of key senate republicans getting grilled over donald trump's miss universe comments say they either weren't watching or don't have an opinion on one of the night's signature moments. "i didn't get to see it. i was traveling back from utah. stupid plane wouldn't let us tie into cnn. so i felt bad about that. i'm going to talk to them," utah sen. orrin hatch said. "i didn't see it guys, i was on an airplane," sen. marco rubio of florida, one of trump's former gop primary rivals, told reporters. sen. ted cruz, who only fully embraced trump last friday, didn't want to talk to reporters. "we put out a statement last night," he told cnn, as he ran into the senate chamber. those who claimed to missed the debate had it the easiest. as they have all year long, gop lawmakers have been in a bind as they were forced to confront the latest controversial statement from trump. tuesday, the questions were about the debate and his comments about former miss universe alicia machado. hillary clinton placed his comments blasting former machado for putting on too much weight front and center monday night, and trump fueled the fire tuesday morning on fox news. "and one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest -- he loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them -- and he called this woman 'miss piggy,' then he called her 'miss housekeeping' because she was latina," clinton said monday night. "donald, she has a name. her name is alicia machado. and she has become a us citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this november." but gop lawmakers who praised trump's debate performance ducked questions about machado. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell was asked about the machado and trump's debate performance, he limited his answer to just: "on the debate, i thought he did just fine." house speaker paul ryan, who has openly criticized trump's remarks he viewed as racist, refused to engage on machado: "i'm not going to get into the who said what this morning on a talk show because i didn't see it." dodging questions about trump has become old hat inside the capitol, since trump first broke through the field of republican candidates, and then fought his way to the nomination. trump's accusation that the judge overseeing the trump university lawsuit was impartial because he was "mexican" (the judge, gonzalo curiel, is from indiana) -- left lawmakers in a similar lurch this past june. the trump answers have become almost perfunctory, based on tuesday's informal survey. indiana sen. dan coats: "no comment." tennessee sen. lamar alexander: "no comment." illinois sen. mark kirk, who is in a tough battle to hold his seat, repeatedly said, "not going to talk about it." sen. susan collins of maine, was one of the only republicans to weigh in on trump's miss universe comment: "well, those are comments i don't agree with." other lawmakers had effusive praise for trump when asked broadly about the debate, but little to say on the specifics. west virginia sen. shelley moore capito explained that she had been listening to the debate in the car and thought trump did an excellent job. but when asked about trump's miss universe comments, she said she must have missed that part. sen. joni ernst, who stood on stage with trump at her "roast and ride" event last month, said, "i thought it was good." but when a reporter tried to ask about specifics, she said, "that's about all the comments i have. but thank you." sen. tim scott of south carolina got a question about trump's answers on criminal justice reform, and said, "i shouldn't have stopped." then scott got a question about trump taking donations from the private prison industry and he stood there, mouth shut and smiling. but when asked broadly about trump's performance, he started talking again. "about his performance? i think he had high points and low points, and at the end of the day i'm looking forward to the next debate with more high points," scott said, as he searched for an elevator. but when he was asked what trump's low points were, scott stood silent for a few seconds, appearing to stall for an elevator. cnn's ted barrett, manu raju and deirdre walsh contributed to this report.      gop lawmakers run from trump on alicia machado comments      
__label__0 washington (cnn)homeland security secretary jeh johnson told a senate hearing tuesday that 18 states have taken up his agency's offer to help improve cyber security for their election systems, in the wake of suspected breaches blamed on russian hackers. "we are seeing a limited number of instances where there have been efforts through cyber intrusions to get into the online presence of various state election agencies. and, one or two of them have been successful, others have not," johnson said at a senate homeland security committee hearing. the issue of the integrity of us elections has been a prominent one on the presidential campaign trail, with republican presidential nominee donald trump and democratic sen. harry reid each raising concerns about possible rigging of the results. both trump and his democratic rival, hillary clinton, said at monday's debate that they would respect the election results. asked by sen. jon tester, d-montana, whether hackers are seeking to change votes, johnson said: "what we are seeing are efforts to get into voter registration rolls, the identity of registered voters, things of that nature, not to change a ballot count." johnson said the matter was still an active investigation and that the source of the intrusions hadn't been concluded. us officials briefed on the investigation have told cnn that an intrusion in an illinois voter registration database and an attempted breach in arizona are believed to be the work of hackers working for russian spy agencies. us officials say there's strong evidence that russian government hackers are behind a series other cyber-attacks against the democratic national committee and other affiliated political organizations. johnson, fbi director james comey and nick rasmussen, director of the national counterterrorism center, on a variety issues during the hearing, ranging from the perceived missteps that failed to prevent recent domestic terrorist attacks to the hillary clinton email investigation. lawmakers used the hearing to press comey on the fbi's handling of suspects in recent domestic attacks, including those behind the orlando mass shooting and the bombings in new york and new jersey. the fbi had done preliminary investigations prior to the attacks on both suspects but closed the files on both men after not finding enough evidence to continue. "i'm not here to say the fbi is terrible because it missed these things, but i'm also troubled that the fbi is unwilling to even admit they've made some mistakes," sen. rand paul, r-kentucky, said. comey said the fbi will review the case of the alleged new york bomber ahmad rahami to see if anything was mishandled. "we will go back and scrub our prior contact with that matter very, very carefully -- and maybe the inspector general will as well, which would be great as well -- and if there is learning, we will learn from it," he said. republicans on the committee renewed their criticism of the fbi for recommending no charges be brought in the clinton probe. comey said the fbi didn't find evidence to bring charges for possible obstruction of justice. comey spoke of the increased threat of domestic attacks as the us bombing campaign against isis prompts foreign fighters to return home. "the so called (isis) caliphate will be crushed -- the challenge will be through the fingers of that crush are going to come hundreds of very, very dangerous people," comey said. "they will not all die on the battlefield in syria and iraq. there will be a terrorist diaspora sometime in the next two to five years like we have never seen before."       dhs: 18 states seeking help securing elections      
__label__0 "we won every poll. virtually every poll," he told supporters tuesday afternoon, challenging the media consensus that hillary clinton prevailed. trump also promoted eleven of these so-called polls in a tweet, calling his wins in them "such a great honor."  but the things trump called "debate polls" -- implying rigorous, scientific polling -- were informal web site surveys that invited anyone to respond. republican pollster kristen soltis anderson told cnnmoney that the surveys are like "junk food." meaningful national polls seek a diverse sample of respondents. the goal is to accurately represent the views of the country by accounting for differences in age, gender, party affiliations and other factors. that's not possible when anonymous web users fill out online surveys. people choose whether to participate, and they can vote multiple times, further warping the results. the only thing these surveys can measure, to a limited degree, is enthusiasm -- and some trump supporters are definitely enthusiastic. but political scientists and researchers say it is a mistake to read much more than that into unscientific survey results. early tuesday morning, former obama strategist david plouffe tweeted that the online surveys cited by trump are simply "bogus." trump's proclivity for unscientific surveys was on display throughout the primary season. he frequently claimed that he "won" debates based on self-selecting polls conducted by web sites like the drudge report. several respected news outlets -- time, cnbc and fortune to name three -- posted the surveys after monday's debate, lending the unreliable practice an air of credibility. while sites like time may value giving visitors a way to opine about the debate, trump's embrace of the results ends up embarrassing both himself and the news outlet involved. "these snap polls are just a way to feed the beast until the next batch of appropriately-conducted polls can come out to tell us if voters actually moved. it's like eating a junk food snack between meals," anderson said. trump's tweet also cited surveys from obscure web sites like "politopinion." in one case on tuesday, trump even cited a poll that did not exist. "i won cbs," he said on "fox & friends." cbs correspondent major garrett took to twitter to clarify: "we did not conduct a post-debate poll." cbs did conduct a focus group of undecided voters, and clinton came out ahead. trump said on fox that the survey results "mean a lot" to him, noting that hundreds of thousands of votes were cast on some of the web sites. that's true, but since people can vote multiple times -- and, with the right software, perhaps even more than that -- it isn't necessarily meaningful. nevertheless, the surveys allow trump and his aides to rail against media elite reactions to the debate and argue that voters are outsmarting pundits. and that's exactly what the campaign did on tuesday. "trump won" was the campaign's dominant social media message, citing the surveys as proof. some political reporters called out the tactic. ‏"trump's aggressive promotion of online (easily manipulated, non-scientific) polls saying he 'won' is a calculated effort to create a reality," emily flitter, who covers the trump campaign for reuters, tweeted. but the co-hosts of "fox & friends," who are reliable cheerleaders for trump, went along with trump's talking point. other fox hosts also picked up on it, even though the network has its own well-regarded polling unit. fox morning news anchor martha maccallum said debate watchers are "leaning toward donald trump, and by pretty large margins in most of these viewer polls." she called cnn's poll the "outlier," showing clinton as the clear winner among debate watchers. in fact, cnn/orc's poll was one of the few polls conducted by professional researchers immediately following the debate. "clinton was deemed the winner of monday night's debate by 62% of voters who tuned in to watch, while just 27% said they thought trump had the better night," cnn polling director jennifer agiesta wrote, based on the findings of interviews with 521 registered voters. "although the survey suggested debate watchers were more apt to describe themselves as democrats than the overall pool of voters, even independents who watched deemed clinton the winner." related: post-debate poll: hillary clinton takes round one conflating cnn's scientific poll with unscientific surveys, as both trump and maccallum did, is highly misleading. some web sites, hungry for traffic, glommed on to the trump-invented controversy. "majority of snap polls show trump won debate by a landslide despite cnn's overwhelming victory for hillary in biggest official survey," the daily mail web site said. unhappy with the results of cnn's scientific poll, trump criticized the network on twitter, on fox and at a campaign event. "we won virtually every poll. except for cnn. and nobody watches cnn," he said. about 10 million people watched the debate on cnn on monday night. overall, more than 80 million people tuned in on television, and millions more live-streamed the debate on the internet.      the problem with donald trump's 'we won every poll' claim      
__label__0 washington (cnn)president barack obama on tuesday tapped the highest-ranking us diplomat in cuba as the first ambassador to the island in more than 50 years. but deep opposition among some senators means it's nearly impossible he'll be confirmed before the president leaves office. jeffrey delaurentis has served as the united states' charge d'affairs in havana since 2014, overseeing the reopening of the us embassy there and helping shepherd in a new era of us-cuba ties. obama wrote in a statement that elevating delaurentis' title to "ambassador" was a "common sense step forward toward a more normal and productive relationship between our two countries." "there is no public servant better suited to improve our ability to engage the cuban people and advance us interests in cuba than jeff," obama wrote. delaurentis was long expected to be named to the ambassador post, but critics of obama's cuba policy have remained steadfast in their opposition to any nomination. cuban-american republican sens. ted cruz and marco rubio have been among the most vocal critics, saying the castro regime is still violating basic human rights. in a statement tuesday, rubio wrote that "rewarding the castro government with a us ambassador is another last-ditch legacy project for the president that needs to be stopped." "this nomination should go nowhere until the castro regime makes significant and irreversible progress in the areas of human rights and political freedom for the cuban people, and until longstanding concerns about the cuban regime's theft of property and crimes against american citizens are addressed," rubio wrote. confirming delaurentis is yet another entry on a white house to-do list for congress that seems destined to go unfulfilled, at least before november's elections. among the other items: confirming obama's supreme court nominee merrick garland and ratifying the trans-pacific partnership trade deal. obama became the first sitting us president to visit cuba in a half-century earlier this year. the last us ambassador to serve in havana left the post in 1960 at the beginning of fidel castro's rule. the president has insisted that 50 years of enmity with cuba hadn't yielded results for either americans or cubans, and maintains that a new approach will better serve both populations. "we only hurt ourselves by not being represented by an ambassador," he wrote in his statement tuesday. "if confirmed by the senate, i know jeff will build on the changes he helped bring about to better support the cuban people and advance america's interests."       obama nominates cuba ambassador, first in over half-century      
__label__0 washington (cnn)senate democrats on tuesday blocked a republican bill to fund the government and battle zika because it did not include money for flint, michigan, to address the city's drinking water crisis. the action comes three days before friday's midnight deadline when agencies are set to run out of money and left congressional leaders searching for a compromise bill that could get enough votes to pass and head off an election season government shutdown. needing 60 votes to pass, the measure failed 45-55. while 12 gop senators also voted against the measure -- for reasons ranging from concerns over spending to the bill's lack of language making changes to the export-import bank -- it was the solid block of "nay" votes from democrats that halted the bill. one possible solution was suggested by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, who said he might drop flood money for louisiana and other states to satisfy democrats who insisted they would not support emergency disaster aid for some states while leaving flint behind. "we keep hearing that their position is no flint, no floods. and that's certainly an option worth discussing," mcconnell told reporters. democrats didn't immediately say if they would accept the gop proposal. "there's no excuse for leaving the people of flint, michigan, behind. if they're helping louisiana, they have to help flint," senate minority leader harry reid said. senate republicans, who earlier this month overwhelmingly backed a major water projects bill that included $220 million for flint, said they would push the republicans who control the house to do the same. but democrats said without an iron-clad agreement, the flint funds would pass the house they would continue to block the short-term government funding bill. "why do you feel as if you have to punish people in louisiana who are digging out from a flood," asked sen. bill cassidy, r-louisiana, who said he didn't object to flint money going into the government funding bill. sen. marco rubio, r-florida, who is anxious to clear the zika funding that will directly aid his state, argued democrats are "looking for any excuse to shut down the government because they think it will help them in the upcoming election." but sen. chuck schumer of new york, a democratic leader, said the government funding bill would pass "in an instant" if republicans agreed to add money for flint. "democrats are going to oppose this bill because it pits victims of one crisis against victims of another and unfairly offers a cold shoulder to those in flint while providing aid to other americans," schumer said.       senate democrats block government funding bill over flint aid      
__label__0 white plains, new york (cnn)when donald trump tried to score points by saying that hillary clinton had spent days off the campaign trail to prepare for monday night's debate, clinton -- having spent days off the trail to prepare -- had a ready reply. "i think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate," clinton said wryly after trump hit clinton for taking time off the trail. "and, yes, i did. you know what else i prepared for? i prepared to be president. and i think that's a good thing." the line was not spontaneous. according to sources inside clinton's debate prep, trump and his surrogates telegraphed his line of attack as they were hitting clinton for the time off before the debate. so they looked for a way to flip the line on the republican nominee and urged clinton to use it. but it wasn't the only pre-planned moment in a debate that became a prolonged opposition research dump on the republican nominee. the most damaging may be when clinton used the story of alicia machado, the former miss universe who says donald trump called her "miss housekeeping" as a way to counter sexism on trump's part. near the end of the debate, when trump didn't back away from saying clinton didn't look like a president, the former secretary of state pounced. "he called this woman 'miss piggy,' then he called her 'miss housekeeping' because she was latina," clinton said. "donald, she has a name. her name is alicia machado. and she has become a us citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this november." trump didn't back away from the line, interrupting clinton as she spoke with "where did you find her?" quickly, the clinton campaign blasted out a video about machado's story. on tuesday, they held a press call with the former miss universe, who said that cried when she heard her name mentioned on monday. when asked how the back-and-forth has played with spanish speaking media, a clinton aide had a one-word response: "h-u-g-e." afterward, clinton's aides were giddy about how the debate played out, using words like "unhinged" to describe trump. that glee was compounded when they heard trump went to the spin room and complained about the microphone, claiming that his was defective. "anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night," clinton said. aides acknowledged that they felt trump effectively hit clinton on trade, especially in attacking her support of the north american free trade agreement, a deal her husband -- who was sitting in the audience -- approved as president. clinton tried to distance herself from the trans pacific partnership on the debate stage, and trump correctly said that she called it the "gold standard" as secretary of state. and one aide also said that while clinton's email answer was shorter and more succinct than past answers, no one inside the campaign likes it when clinton spends any time explaining her decision to use a private email server as secretary of state. but for the most part, there was no hiding the enthusiasm on clinton's side. she received a loud ovation from staff and crew boarding her campaign plane tuesday morning. clinton poured herself into debate prep for days before the monday contest. the former first lady conducted two-a-day debate sessions on friday, saturday and sunday, not leaving the doral arrowwood hotel and spa until past 11 p.m. et to return to her nearby home. ron klain, who advised president barack obama and ran part of hillary clinton's debate prep, played moderator lester holt during he session, according to a clinton aide. klain played only one version of holt, aides said, believing that the nbc anchor would fact check trump when confronted with a blatant falsehood but also leave it to clinton to do some fact checking, too. aides who were in on the debate preparations said philippe reines, a longtime adviser who played trump in the sessions, poured himself into the role, sporting a red tie and large cufflinks to look like the businessman. reines, who spent hours studying trump's policies and debate performances, acted out some of the republican nominee's mannerism during the prep, including a hand gesture that the campaign called "the cobra" -- where trump brings his fingers together like a snake ready to pounce. while reines didn't try to mimic trump's voice, aides said the longtime adviser's rendition of the republican nominee was so on point that even clinton was surprised. as she came off the stage monday, clinton had the highest of praise, an aide said. "wow, that sounded exactly like philippe," clinton said.       inside debate camp: how hillary clinton prepared to turn trump's attacks back on him

"she didn't just stand by him -- she attacked monica lewinsky, and after being married to bill clinton for 20 years, if you didn't know the moment monica lewinsky said bill clinton violated her and was telling the truth -- then you're too stupid to be president," the former new york city mayor and prominent donald trump surrogate told elite daily shortly after monday night's debate. trump told cnn's dana bash shortly after the debate concluded that he was "very happy that i was able to hold back on the -- you know, on the indiscretions with respect to bill clinton, because i have a lot of respect for chelsea clinton and i just didn't want to say what i was going to say." giuliani said the gop nominee's biggest mistake during the debate was being "too reserved and too gentlemanly." had he been debating, giuliani said, he would have "talked about what she did to monica lewinsky, what that woman standing there did to monica lewinsky." the lewinsky scandal resulted in bill clinton being impeached on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, though he was ultimately acquitted in the senate. when news of the scandal first broke in 1998, clinton led the white house's behind-the-scenes damage-control efforts and appeared on several news programs to defend her husband, blaming the allegations on a "vast right-wing conspiracy" that she said was part of a political effort to bring down the president. giuliani, however, accused clinton of "trying to paint her as an insane young woman." he did not offer any proof in his interview and a message left with the clinton campaign seeking response was not immediately returned. giuliani and trump have both been married three times and engaged in extramarital relationships that have led to past divorces. but asked about trump's hint that he could bring up bill clinton's infidelity at an upcoming debate, clinton campaign manager robby mook told cnn's alisyn camerota on "new day" tuesday that the former first lady was "ready for anything." "this is -- it's such an obvious dodge. he spiraled out at the end of the debate and so, of course, he wants to bully. he wants to talk about the supposed indiscretions," mook said. cnn's dan merica contributed to this report.      giuliani: clinton 'too stupid to be president'      
__label__0 washington (cnn)spending by super pacs tied to donald trump friends such as ben carson and banker andy beal will help make this week the general election's most expensive yet. republicans and democrats will spend almost $28 million on radio and television this week, according to advertising records, as trump substantially increases his advertising buy for the final stretch. he's spending $6.4 million in nine states, part of what aides have said will be a $100 million television campaign through election day. trump on tuesday began reserving time on broadcast and cable through november 8. and he's getting help on other mediums, too. beal, a dallas billionaire who doubles as a semi-professional poker player, has started his own super pac that has spent $1 million on pro-trump newspaper and digital advertisements. with a net worth estimated to be $9 billion, beal is effectively spurning the other trump super pacs who had courted him relentlessly. it is unlikely that beal's group, save america from its government, will do television. but jacob cherner, a beal aide, said he could not put a limit on how much beal would spend. "i know his interest is intense," cherner said. another new group helping trump in the homestretch. a formerly pro-carson super pac, the 2016 committee, is spending more than $1 million on ads for trump on african-american radio in florida, north carolina, ohio and pennsylvania, per records. "if ben carson trusts donald trump, so can we," the narrator says in one new spot. republicans all together are spending about $8.5 million on radio and television. democrats are spending about $19.5 million -- thanks to $11.4 million from hillary clinton's campaign, and $7.5 million from priorities usa, her super pac.       carson, beal groups make this week the general election's costliest      
__label__0 washington (cnn)when bernie sanders stood before the democratic national convention in philadelphia, he promised "to do everything i can" to elect hillary clinton president. but for much of the summer, sanders was consumed with authoring a book he plans to release in november, while raising money for progressive candidates down the ticket. he has done just a handful of campaign events for clinton, and hasn't yet activated his grassroots army that powered him to win more than 12 million votes during the democratic primary. that's about to change. in recent days, sanders has privately informed his old rival that he plans a surge of campaign events in key battleground states, including ones the vermont independent won during the democratic primary campaign and others with pockets of younger voters turned off by clinton, according to two sources familiar with the conversations between the two camps. that means more stops in states like michigan and new hampshire, and possible trips to nevada, pennsylvania, colorado and wisconsin. the clinton camp even plans to deploy sanders to minnesota, a state likely to go democratic in the fall but one the clinton camp is quietly trying to shore up as donald trump gains ground across the country, sources said. on wednesday, sanders will appear with clinton in durham, new hampshire, an effort aimed directly at millennials by promoting college affordability. and it comes at a crucial time: clinton is seeing her support stall among millennial voters, who are turning to libertarian nominee gary johnson instead. in a tuesday interview with cnn, sanders promised that he would make the case directly to millennials about clinton's proposal to ease tuition payments to families earning less than $125,000 annually, calling it a "big deal." and he said that he would draw a direct contrast between trump and clinton on the issue of humans causing global warming, which the gop nominee has questioned in the past. "to the degree that we get those points out, i think she will do a whole lot better among younger people," sanders said. asked if he should do more for clinton after keeping a relatively low profile after the convention, sanders said: "we will be working very aggressively." but he would not answer directly when asked if he would activate his small donor network to pour money into clinton's coffers. "i'm going to be campaigning as hard as i can," sanders said. a source close to sanders said it's unlikely he would use his vast email list to help clinton raise money, instead reserving that for down-ticket candidates. instead, the source said, sanders will become a visible presence along the campaign trail in an attempt to turn his core supporters to the clinton camp -- namely younger voters. indeed, millennial voters are becoming a significant problem for clinton, dogged by her email controversy, questions about her honesty and being a long-time fixture of the democratic establishment. in a bloomberg poll released this week, clinton leads trump 50%-40% among voters under 35 in a two-way race, down from her 29-point lead in august. but when the poll added the green party and libertarian candidates on the ballot, clinton's lead shrinks to 40%-36% -- with johnson getting 11% of the millennial vote. to reverse the slide, the clinton campaign plans to lean on sanders and other progressive firebrands, like sen. elizabeth warren, to fire up the base. but top democrats say that surrogates can only do so much. "bernie is going to be out there some more; he's just finishing his book," house minority leader nancy pelosi said tuesday. "he has been out there for hillary. he'll be out there more, but she is going to have to make her own case as well because you can only transfer so much." after a tense primary where sanders surprised clinton and the political world by racking up big victories, the two sides developed trust during the july convention when the vermont independent's team helped squash an uprising by sanders' backers eager to disrupt the proceedings. on labor day, he barnstormed new hampshire for clinton -- with two events in the state -- and later did a three-city swing through ohio. a source close to sanders said the senator plans to hit the road for house and senate candidates starting next week, including in states like washington not considered a presidential battleground. but with sanders' ability to connect with younger progressives at a time when clinton is struggling with those voters, many are eager to see the self-described democratic socialist follow through on his vow to do more to help their presidential nominee. "we all know the last 30 days is really when you motivate people, and say, 'hey. you can't sit home, you can't stay out.' and i think (sanders) knows that's the crucial point," said sen. claire mccaskill, d-missouri, a top clinton surrogate. asked if she were worried about millennial voters flocking to johnson, mccaskill added: "it doesn't seem thoughtful to me. it does feel like he could be a spoiler in some regard. but i still feel pretty positive and optimistic about millennials coming around -- especially with bernie and elizabeth warren, and everybody's help." cnn's elizabeth landers and deirdre walsh contributed to this report.      sanders, clinton plot new push amid slipping support with millennials      
__label__0 melbourne, florida (cnn)donald trump declared himself the unquestionable winner of his first debate against hillary clinton during a rally tuesday night, then relived the entire debate before a florida crowd of supporters, this time with the help of a teleprompter -- and without clinton baiting him. the republican presidential nominee ticked down a list of issues he failed to sufficiently hammer clinton on during their 90-minute bout -- from her foreign policy failures to her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. he also insisted on defending two factually incorrect statements he made the previous night. trump touted unscientific, online post-debate polls as "things of beauty." he also again claimed to be "holding back" during the faceoff because he "didn't want to do anything to embarrass" clinton. that comment came after blaming debate moderator lester holt of nbc news for being tough on him earlier in the day, "for 90 minutes i watched her very carefully and i was also holding back. i didn't want to do anything that embarrassed her," trump said tuesday. "for 90 minutes, she argued against change, while i called for dramatic change. we have to have dramatic change." but while he spent much of the debate on the defense, trump was free to unleash on clinton without abandon as he rallied thousands of supporters tuesday night in an airplane hangar. he slammed clinton for having "defended every major failure she helped create," placing particular emphasis on clinton's track record as secretary of state. "iraq and libya are in chaos," trump said. "here in america we've seen one islamic terror strike after another." trump pointed to clinton's decades-old career in the political spotlight -- arguing she has not accomplished enough, and failed too often, in that time period. "i kept saying for 26 years you've been doing nothing," trump said. "she's the candidate of yesterday. and ours is the campaign and we're the people of the future." clinton was the first lady of arkansas and then the united states before she was elected for the first time to public office in 2000 as a us senator from new york. and while clinton made it through the debate on monday with relatively few attacks from trump on the subject, on tuesday, trump attacked her over her email practices, including her false assertion she neither sent nor received information marked classified. "another crooked hillary lie," trump said. "have you ever seen a greater embarrassment to our country?" clinton is "an insider fighting only for her donors and insiders," trump said, touting his outsider status. but trump also entrenched himself on two issues the debate's moderator, holt, called out on for being factually inaccurate. he insisted the stop-and-frisk practice used in new york city that a federal judge ruled unconstitutional in 2013 was constitutional. and he argued that he was "against going into iraq," even though he did not publicly oppose the war before it started, expressed support for it a month before congress voted to approve military force and even praised the invasion as a "tremendous success." and earlier in the day, as the clinton campaign sought to highlight disparaging comments trump made about former miss universe alicia machado, trump reiterated his criticism. "she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem," he said on "fox and friends." trump on tuesday also returned to his characterization of the press as "the most dishonest people i've ever dealt with" and, as he continued to review the previous night's debate, suggested clinton's success was tied to the "mainstream media." "without the mainstream media, folks, she wouldn't even be here. she wouldn't even have a chance," trump said. but trump also signaled that he and his campaign took note of his strongest moments in the debate. trump hammered home his commitment to addressing trade imbalances tuesday night and pointed to his back-and-forth with clinton over trade, particularly when he called her out for calling the trans-pacific partnership deal the "gold standard" of trade agreements. clinton now opposes the tpp trade deal. "the american people rendered their verdict. the post-debate polls as i said to you were so great, but we exposed hillary clinton's real position on nafta which was by the way the single worst deal as you'll ever see and trans-pacific partnership -- another great disaster that she lied about," trump said.       trump touts debate performance in florida rally      
__label__0 new york (cnn)former sen. john warner will endorse hillary clinton for president wednesday morning, handing the democratic nominee another high-profile republican endorsement just 42 days before the election, cnn has learned. warner will join his fellow virginian and democratic vice presidential nominee tim kaine at a campaign event in alexandria, virginia -- a state clinton is favored to win but that republican presidential nominee donald trump has been eyeing. a clinton campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about the forthcoming gop endorsement, said that warner's public show of support will help underscore that the former secretary of state has the temperament and experience to serve as president and head of the u.s. armed forces. warner is a former us navy secretary, who served 30 years in the senate, most of those in a senior position on the armed services committee. several other former high-ranking republicans have already endorsed clinton over trump including diplomat john negroponte, who served under president ronald reagan and president george w. bush, and brent scowcroft, national security advisor under presidents gerald ford and george h.w. bush.       clinton nabs another high-profile gop endorsement      
__label__0 melbourne, florida (cnn)donald trump argued tuesday that the controversial stop-and-frisk policing tactic once employed in new york city is constitutional, adding that it would "overwhelmingly" save african-american and hispanic lives. the practice, however, has been criticized as racial profiling that unfairly targeted those very minority groups. trump quibbled with debate moderator lester holt on monday night after holt pointed out that the stop-and-frisk practice as implemented in new york city was ruled unconstitutional. "i explained last night that stop-and-frisk is constitutional," trump said at a florida rally, speaking of a back-and-forth he had with debate moderator lester holt of nbc news during monday night's presidential debate. while stop-and-frisk policies are used in various us cities, the aggressive implementation of stop-and-frisk in new york was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge in 2013, who said the policy violated the rights of minorities who were disproportionately targeted. "stop, question and frisk" remains a policing practice in new york, but has been dramatically reined in. but trump pressed the issue even as he continued to make entreaties to african-american voters. "a policy like stop-and-frisk could save thousands of lives in a city like chicago, just like it saved thousands of lives in new york. overwhelmingly, this will save african-american and hispanic lives -- citizens who are entitled to the same protections as every american," trump said. "i say this to african-american communities. what do you have to lose? donald trump is going to fix it. we'll fix it. we're going to make it safe," he added. trump then ticked down a list of crime statistics, pointing in particular to the more than 3,000 shootings that have taken place in chicago just this year. "i will never back down -- and that's true, obama's hometown -- i will never back down from trying to save american lives," trump said, pointing out that chicago is the hometown of president barack obama.       trump: stop-and-frisk would 'overwhelmingly' save black and hispanic lives      
__label__0 washington (cnn)the senate will vote wednesday to override president barack obama's veto of a bill to give victims and families of the 9/11 terrorist attacks the legal right to sue saudi arabia for any purported role in the plot, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said monday. the measure will need a two-thirds vote of the chamber to succeed -- which is expected -- before going to the house for a similar override vote later this week. it would be the first time in obama's nearly eight years in office that one of his vetoes will be overturned. the president opposes the bill because he says it could open the door to lawsuits against the us for actions taken by military service members, diplomats and others. obama expressed sympathy for the 9/11 families in his veto message friday, but said he vetoed the bill because the law would hurt the effectiveness of the administration's action against terrorism by taking questions of foreign states' involvement in terrorism "out of the hands of national security and foreign policy professionals and placing them in the hands of private litigants and courts." in recent days, several senators who allowed the bill to pass without objection expressed misgivings for their decisions and said they wanted to find a way to address the white house's concerns about sovereign immunity. "i have tremendous empathy for the victims," said sen. bob corker, r-tennessee, the chairman of the foreign relations committee said two weeks ago. "at the same time i have concerns about the precedent this bill will set and what it may mean to american service men and women and others. let's face it -- our alleged drone attacks have killed civilians in pakistan. our alleged drone attacks have killed civilians in afghanistan. and i think once you start opening the door for these types of activities it can be very problematic." despite those second thoughts, there was never much traction among lawmakers to prevent the override. heavy lobbying by the saudi government, which opposed the bill, was met by a more powerful force -- the emotional appeal of the 9/11 families who fanned out on capitol hill in recent weeks to prevent the bill from stalling. once both chambers override the veto, the bill becomes law regardless of obama's opposition. cnn's kevin liptak contributed to this report.      senate to vote wednesday to override 9/11 lawsuit bill veto      
__label__0 washington (cnn)senate democratic leader harry reid called donald trump a racist on the senate floor monday, an escalation in the nevada lawmaker's war of words against the gop presidential nominee in recent weeks. "donald trump is a racist," he said. reid's direct comment goes further than the retiring five-term senator was willing to ten days ago during an interview with cnn's manu raju. when asked then if he thought trump is a racist, reid responded: "all you guys have a job to do. you make that decision. i'm not going to." previously, reid excoriated trump from the senate floor, calling him a "spoiled brat," "a con artist" and a "human leech who will bleed the country." and at a september 13 news conference reid ripped trump for being overweight and over his eating habits, charging that the media "magnified" hillary clinton's recent bout with pneumonia. "take a look at this character that's running for president. he complains about her health. what does he do? he's 70 years old. he's not slim and trim. he brags about eating fast food every day. look at his health a little bit," reid said. sean spicer, communications director and adviser for the republican national committee, told cnn's wolf blitzer on monday that he was "almost speechless" over reid's remarks. "there is a good thing harry reid is retiring because i think the people of nevada and the people of this country have had it with harry reid," he said. "nevada is continuing to trend for donald trump. so if he thinks donald trump is a racist, then he thinks the majority of nevada thinks so, too ,and i think that's pretty sad." trump responded to the "slim and trim" comment in an interview with the washington post: "harry reid? i think he should go back and start working out again with his rubber work-out pieces," trump said, referring to an exercise band that snapped, causing reid a serious facial injury that impaired his sight. the trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on reid's latest jab. cnn's daniella diaz contributed to this report.      harry reid calls donald trump 'a racist'      
__label__0 (cnn)glenn beck, a staunch ted cruz supporter in the 2016 gop presidential race, interviewed the texas senator monday in a series of often-tense exchanges, after cruz finally endorsed gop standard-bearer donald trump. it ended with beck apologizing to listeners for backing cruz. "do you have any new information that has made you say 'oh my gosh, he's now not a sociopathic liar and now there's suddenly a reason to believe him?'" beck had asked cruz on "the glenn beck radio program." cruz, who in july dramatically declined to endorse trump during his republican national convention, responded that the election is "is a binary choice" between democrat hillary clinton and trump. cruz said he was never "never trump," but always "never hillary." but beck repeatedly asked cruz why he changed his mind and decided to back trump. "this is all the information you had in cleveland," beck said, unsatisfied by cruz's answers. "what i was trying to do in cleveland was lay out a path to uniting republicans," cruz said. "this is about principle, about ideas. that's the test i'm applying. what i do know is that hillary clinton fails that test profoundly." after the interview concluded, beck said for the first time, he "heard ted cruz calculate." beck ended his conservative radio program with an apology to his listeners for supporting cruz, adding that he should have backed marco rubio instead. "that was so calculated that it was stunning to me," beck said. "i think i have to apologize and say, maybe, perhaps, those of you who said ted cruz is calculating and a smarmy politician, i think i may have to slightly agree with you and apologize for saying, 'no, he wasn't.'"       glenn beck apologizes to listeners for backing ted cruz      
__label__0 washington (cnn)president barack obama ignored his own "no hats" edict monday when he partook in a traditional american indian ceremony in washington. appearing at the white house's tribal nations conference, obama was wrapped in a wool blanket and crowned with a straw hat as a show of honor. brian cladoosby, president of the national congress of american indians, said the blanket was called "rhythm of the land." he said there was a blanket set aside for first lady michelle obama as well. as members from different tribes played drums and shakers, obama smiled and faced an audience comprised of representatives from the 567 federally recognized tribes that were invited to attend. he removed the hat after 20 seconds or so as the ceremony proceeded. "what an amazing honor and what a kind gesture for the honor song and the blanket and the hat," obama said afterward, calling the event "very moving" and a reflection of the friendships he's developed among tribal communities. an embroidered inscription on the blanket gave obama's crow namesake, "black eagle," and a description: "awe kooda bilaxpak kuxshish," or "one who helps people throughout the land." a label identified the blanket as a product of the pendleton woolen mills line. "i have to say that i am very glad that you also have a blanket for michelle so she doesn't steal mine," he said. "she would, too!" obama used his remarks to highlight his efforts toward improving conditions on reservations, including bolstering schools and advancing medical care. the president has typically been wary of donning any headwear besides a baseball cap -- a political lesson he imparted during an appearance at the white house in 2013. "here's the general rule: you don't put stuff on your head if you're president. that's politics 101," he said when presented with a football helmet from the us naval academy. "you never look good wearing something on your head."       obama dons hat, blanket during tribal nations ceremony      
__label__0 newark (cnn)former port authority executives and new jersey gov. chris christie staffers planned to make the traffic from the september 2013 lane closures at the george washington bridge "as bad as possible," according to testimony heard in federal court monday. david wildstein, former port authority director of interstate capital projects, testified that in june 2013, bridget kelly, christie's former deputy chief of staff, was upset that their office had not secured the endorsement of the democratic mayor of fort lee new jersey, mark sokolich, for christie's reelection campaign. wildstein, who has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation, told kelly that shutting down access lanes to the george washington bridge to put some political pressure on sokolich was an option, according to his testimony. wildstein is testifying as part of his plea deal. sokolich testified last week that being a "democrat in a democratic town" put him in an uncomfortable position vis-a-vis a christie endorsement, and he eventually declined because he did not want to "alienate anyone." on august 13, 2013, and as cnn has previously reported, wildstein received an email from kelly saying: "time for some traffic problems in fort lee." "got it," wildstein responded. a phone call with kelly the same day established the lane closures would go forward, it was revealed in testimony monday. "i did not question senior officials in the office of the governor," wildstein said in court when asked if he questioned the decision. wildstein became the de facto organizer of the eventual lane closures, and communicated every step of the way with kelly and his then-boss, former port authority deputy executive director, bill baroni, according to his testimony. wildstein and kelly discussed and agreed that there would be no advance notice of the closures to fort lee officials or the public. they discussed how the port authority would respond to any inquiries, and agreed that all calls would be directed to baroni's office and baroni would not return the calls, testimony revealed. this "radio silence" policy was discussed with and approved by baroni, wildstein said. wildstein testified that that lack of advance notice was to "maximize the impact on fort lee." wildstein also recalled discussing the timing of the closures with baroni and kelly. baroni asked when the first day of school in fort lee was, and when wildstein told baroni it was september 9, baroni smiled and said, "fantastic," according to wildstein's testimony. kelly agreed on the september 9 date. wildstein testified that his initial plan was to shut down all three fort lee access lanes, but after discussing the matter with port authority engineers who feared this could cause "sideswipe crashes," wildstein recommended to baroni and kelly that they shut down two lanes. on friday, september 6, 2013, wildstein informed several port authority staffers of the closures that were scheduled to begin on monday, september 9. bob durando, port authority general manager of the george washington bridge expressed concern, telling wildstein that the closures would cause a "mess." wildstein told durando the closures would be going forward, and to prepare accordingly. "i told him not to say anything to anybody," wildstein testified. wildstein told durando to direct any inquiries he gets during the closures to baroni's office. wildstein then informed former port authority chief engineer, peter zipf, of the closures, and asked zipf to organize a way to get "some numbers" on the traffic patterns. wildstein also informed cedrick fulton, port authority director of tunnels, bridges and terminals. fulton asked if port authority executive director, patrick foye, was aware. wildstein testified that he told fulton "yes," but that this was a lie. all of these staffers were under the impression that the closures were part of a traffic study. on the day the closures began, wildstein watched the traffic build up on screens inside a port authority administration building on the fort lee side of the george washington bridge. "i knew the plan that i had set into motion was working," wildstein testified. a port authority lieutenant also drove wildstein around fort lee so wildstein could see the traffic on the ground. wildstein testified that he called kelly that morning to tell her that traffic was building up, and "she was pleased." several calls and emails began coming in to baroni and wildstein from fort lee officials, including the mayor, sokolich, but their plan of "radio silence" was put into effect and no messages were returned. last week, wildstein testified that baroni's role at the bi-state agency was essentially to be a representative of christie's administration and that their top priority was to represent christie's office's interests. wildstein said he created a phrase that he and baroni often used, "the one constituent rule." this referred to the fact that governor christie's opinion or good favor was the only one that mattered when it came to port authority affairs. wildstein and baroni used the "one constituent rule" as a barometer by which decisions would be made. kelly and baroni face conspiracy and fraud charges in connection with bridgegate. their attorneys have previously said they will both testify in their own defenses.       bridgegate: port authority officials planned to make fort lee 'traffic jam as bad as possible'      
__label__0 washington (cnn)four days before the government is scheduled to run out of money, lawmakers on capitol hill remain at odds about whether to add millions of dollars for flint, michigan, to a spending bill to keep agencies operating. democrats are insisting help for flint -- hard hit last year by lead poisoning in its drinking water supply -- be attached to the must-pass bill. if it's not, they vow to block the legislation on a key vote in the senate on tuesday, leaving little time to get a funding bill through both chambers. but top democrats signaled monday there may be a way to resolve the impasse: if house republicans were to assure them the flint money would make it into a separate bill that the house is voting on this week. a top house republican leader seemed receptive to the idea. "this funding measure does not quote a single penny for flint, michigan. not a penny. the people of flint, michigan, have been waiting for emergency assistance to clean their poison water for more than a year," senate democratic leader harry reid said in a floor speech. "senate republicans claim they'll address the needs of flint when we return after the election. we've heard that before, haven't we?" republicans counter that reid's demand for flint funding to be added to the government spending bill are new and may be politically motivated, designed to disrupt smooth passage of government funding and make republicans appear ineffective just weeks before the presidential and congressional elections that will determine the balance of power in the capital. "it's true that some in democratic leadership would like to turn this simple 10-week funding bill into some unnecessary partisan food fight," senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said. "they think it's good election-year politics." last thursday, after weeks of unresolved negotiations, frustrated senate republicans stepped away from the negotiating table and put a gop-authored bill on the floor, essentially daring democrats to oppose it. the republican bill would fund the government and the federal response to zika. importantly, republicans said it met democratic demands for leaving out controversial policy riders. the bill also included what republicans described as a "down payment" for disaster aid for flood-stricken louisiana. but democratic leaders balked arguing they couldn't support money for flooding for louisiana unless flint was also addressed. earlier this month, the senate passed the water resources development act, a major water bill that included $220 million in relief aid and loans for flint. the house is set to pass its version of that bill this week, but it doesn't have any money for flint. democrats remain skeptical republicans will actually agree to provide money for flint as the two chambers merge those two competing bills into final legislation. however, a democratic source suggested monday that one possible way to end the stalemate would be for house republicans to give democrats an "ironclad" commitment that the flint money would be added to that pending water bill. reid suggested that was a possible path forward, too, when he said on the floor to republicans: "call and tell me they're going to take care of this. give me some assurance we're going to take care of it." senate republicans believe they've already shown a commitment to flint when they overwhelmingly approved the water bill with flint funding and have vowed to press house republicans to do the same. house majority leader kevin mccarthy, r-california, told reporters monday the flint aid "works perfectly" in the water bill. mccarthy would not say if he would allow the house democrats to add the flint aid as an amendment to the water bill, but argued that it would be an issue for a conference committee to settle since the aid is included in the senate package. senators will vote tuesday afternoon on whether to begin debate on the government funding bill. sixty votes are needed for it to advance and democrats should be able to block it despite a couple of defections from democratic senators whose states are impacted by zika and who want to quickly approve that funding.       reid signals possible solution to funding stalemate      
__label__0 (cnn)a defensive bernie sanders argued monday appearance and style mattered little to voters during the primary when he was debating hillary clinton, at least to those weighing in "online" afterward. "as you know, though, senator, appearance and style matter a lot in a debate, it's not just the ideas, it's the art of it," cnn's erin burnett said to sanders ahead of the pending faceoff between donald trump and clinton. "no, no, i don't know that," sanders, who now supports clinton, responded. "let me just say this, with all due respect, i disagree with you." "when i debated clinton, it was a very interesting phenomenon. most of the time, not all of the time, the media seemed to think clinton looked more presidential. and she 'won the debate.' but you know what? you go online, we did much better because people listened to what i had to say," he said. "so i do not agree that style and looks and how you comb your hair is what the important issue is." sanders offered that clinton doesn't need his debate advice because "she does these things very well," but it would be best not to see the matchup as "an entertainment show." "i think what we have to do is focus on the issues and not see tonight as an entertainment show," he told burnett. sanders said that he wants the debates to be more about the issues than about personalities. "let's talk about which candidate is going to be better for working families," he said. "i believe that as a nation we have struggled as a long time to overcome bigotry and racism. donald trump is making the cornerstone of his campaign in fact bigotry."       defensive sanders says he won primary debates 'online'      
__label__0 (cnn)mike pence on monday night was tight-lipped about running mate donald trump's planned debate tactics, offering an opened-ended "we'll see where it goes" when asked. "i think what you'll see tonight is the same donald trump you've seen throughout this campaign," the indiana governor told cnn's jake tapper before the presidential debate. "he's going to be a bold truth-teller, he's going to speak plainly." he added: "i think donald trump always speaks straight from his heart and straight from his mind." defensive sanders says he won primary debates 'online' pence, on-site for the debate on long island at hofstra university, said his own debate prep is more "traditional" than his running mate's. "my focus the last four years has been and continues to be leading the state of indiana," he said. "so i've been brushing up on all those washington issues ... but i'm looking forward to a good debate this week." "my only advice to him is be yourself," he said. "i've come to know him over the last several months ... this is a good man who i believe will make a great president of the united states." when asked about trump releasing his tax returns, an issue that has been repeatedly brought up during the course of trump's campaign, pence reiterated the campaign's previous stance. "i think donald trump has made it very clear that he will release his tax returns when the routine audit is complete," he said.       pence on trump's debate plan: 'we'll see where it goes'      
__label__0 washington (cnn)two decades later, hillary clinton is still haunted by the ghosts of nafta. labor unions and liberal activists are preparing to highlight free trade — an issue central to bill and hillary clinton's political brand in the early 1990s — if she opts to run for president in 2016. driving their anger: the trans-pacific partnership, a massive new pact that that would usurp the clinton-era north american free trade agreement's place as the biggest-ever free trade agreement. president barack obama's administration has been negotiating the chile-to-japan deal for years, and it's increasingly drawing scrutiny from the democratic base as the talks near completion. the new deal has reminded labor halls across the country of the old one — and that it was their biggest problem with the clintons. compounding the problem is that free trade, particularly nafta, is an issue that clinton has vacillated on since her husband's administration. as first lady, clinton backed nafta and spoke highly of it at stops for the administration. but once she was elected to the senate and later ran for president, her support of free trade -- and her husband's landmark agreement -- began to wane. on the campaign trail, clinton acknowledged that nafta has "hurt a lot of american workers" and advocated for broad reform of trade policy. president barack obama's campaign even used the flip-flop against clinton during the 2008 primary. but after clinton lost the nomination and agreed to serve as the president's secretary of state, she began to warm up to free trade, and particularly the tpp. in her memoir, which clinton's spokesman said was her most updated statement on the tpp, clinton wrote, "it's safe to say that the tpp won't be perfect. no deal negotiated among a dozen countries ever will be - but its higher standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit american businesses and workers." that history worries some labor leaders who are prepared to hold clinton to a standard that includes her support of free trade agreements. hillary clinton: dodging tough questions should be 'disqualifying' in iowa afl-cio president richard trumka told cnn the issue of free trade could hang over hillary clinton in 2016. sen. bernie sanders of vermont says he'll make it a centerpiece of his campaign if he runs for president. and union workers across the country - including some who lined up to see clinton speak at a labor hall in 2014 - are talking about it, too. "i think nafta itself will be remembered for as long as this generation draws a warm breath," richard trumka said in an interview. "when i talk to people about it, they don't remember that it was a republican majority that passed nafta. they remember that it was president clinton." labor leaders see clinton's 1994 signing of nafta, which created a free-trade zone with canada and mexico, as the moment when blue collar wages began to stagnate. trumka said that free trade -- especially the tpp -- is one of the biggest priorities for the afl-cio and something that the group will use to gauge their support of candidates in 2015 and 2016. the issue is part of the group's "raising wages" priority plan which looks to raise the wages of all americans. the longtime labor leader, whose relationship with the clintons goes back decades, said it was up to hillary clinton whether the legacy of nafta will hurt her campaign. "it all depends on what her position is on trade. if her position on trade is that nafta is really a good thing and i want to continue it, it will definitely hurt her," he said. "all politicians, democrats and republicans, take about raising wages. but you can't be for raising wages while being for the same old trade policies." that's where the trans-pacific partnership — which liberal activists have taken to calling "nafta on steroids" — comes in. 7 things hillary clinton says at almost every speech free trade won't go away in 2016 it isn't only trumka, though, that will likely apply pressure on clinton regarding free trade. two outspoken liberal senators -- both of whom have been followed by 2016 speculation -- have come out strong against the tpp. sanders, an independent who caucuses with democrats, came out against the tpp earlier in 2014 and recently wrote a letter that accused the white house of crafting the deal in secret. in an interview, the outspoken senator that while the concept of trade "is a good idea," trade agreements like nafta and tpp have been raw deals for american workers. "it was very clear to me that any agreement that forces american workers to compete against desperate, desperate people who are working for pennies an hour is grotesquely unfair," sanders said, recalling the 1990s when he traveled to mexico to see the working and living conditions of workers producing goods sold in the u.s. unlike some labor and liberal leaders, sanders does not hang nafta on hillary clinton. "hillary clinton was not the president. bill clinton was the president," he said. "hillary will have to speak to her own views on trade." that said, though, sanders has brought free trade up on every trip he has made to iowa -- the first-in-the-nation caucus state -- and when asked whether he would make the issue a key part of his possible presidential run he bluntly said: "i will give you a three letter answer to that - the answer is y-e-s." why many liberals don't trust hillary clinton joining sanders is sen. elizabeth warren, who told an afl-cio audience recently that liberals "believe in trade policies and tax codes that will strengthen our economy, that will raise our standard of living, that will create american jobs because we will never give up on these three words: made in america." warren has also written a letter to u.s. trade representative mike froman questioning the deal. the fact that warren and sanders are involved means this issue is not going away, especially for clinton. both represent the former first lady's left flank and are politicians who don't even need to run for president to dictate some of the issues that become big campaign issues. clinton is a moving target on nafta bill clinton still defends nafta as a good deal for america. just last november, at the 10th anniversary of the clinton library, the former president said, "nafta is still controversial but people will thank me for it in 20 years." hillary clinton has waffled on the issue, though. as first lady, clinton backed nafta. "i think that everybody is in favor of free and fair trade," she said during a meeting with union workers in 1996, "and i think that nafta is proving its worth." in her 2003 memoir, "living history," clinton also writes glowingly about nafta, including it among her husband's "legislative victories" and noting it would "expand u.s. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization." but when she entered the senate in 2000 and ran for president in 2008, clinton's tune on free trade began to change. she conducted a study as senator that found the agreement hurt new york workers' ability to sell goods in canada and spoke out against nafta during her 2008 campaign. "nafta and the way it's been implemented has hurt a lot of american workers," clinton said at a 2007 forum with the afl-cio. "clearly we have to have a broad reform in how we approach trade. nafta's a piece of it, but it's not the only piece of it." clinton lost her race for president, though, and went on to serve as barack obama's secretary of state. in the role, she oversaw the president's much noted pivot to asia. at the center of that move was the tpp. "one of our most important tools for engaging with vietnam was a proposed new trade agreement called the trans-pacific partnership (tpp), which would link markets throughout asia and the americas, lowering trade barriers while raising standards on labor, the environment, and intellectual property," clinton wrote in her 2014 memoir "hard choices." as secretary of state, clinton also talked up the benefits of the tpp and during a trip to korea in 2011, she advocated for "as few barriers to trade and investment as possible." when asked for clinton's current position on free trade and the tpp, a spokesman pointed cnn to what the former secretary of state wrote in her book. iowans 'absolutely sure' hillary clinton is running republicans have picked up on the problem for clinton and have started to point out her changes in opinion. before clinton went to michigan last year to endorse candidates, america rising pac, an anti-clinton communication and research group, questioned clinton's "phony populism on free trade." "a peculiar thing happens every time hillary clinton decides to run for president," the group said in a blog post. "her views on free trade start sliding left and she calls for a 'time out' on free trade agreements." these republican attacks - and more likely to come - show the political problem clinton faces. if she runs for president, she will either have to woo labor and liberal leaders by blasting agreements like tpp and nafta and risk looking like she is backtracking on her state department years. or she can embrace deals that she made at state and risk what has become eager liberal anger. tpp likely to be left for next president for all the comparisons, though, the tpp would actually be a much different -- and more comprehensive -- trade deal than nafta was. older pacts have mostly dealt with moving goods into and out of countries. but in the 12-country pacific rim deal, u.s. negotiators are pushing for rules that would help companies -- especially pharmaceutical drug-makers -- extend their patents and copyrights for much longer periods, keeping generic medicines off poorer foreign countries' markets. they're working to create a tribunal that would give corporations a venue to challenge whether governments' rules and regulations are in line with their obligations under the trade deal. and they're crafting chapters on environmental protections, labor rights and the digital economy. they're trying to prevent countries from restricting where data servers can be located, or what data companies can move across international borders. the trans-pacific partnership, like nafta, includes canada and mexico. but the deal's real pearl is japan -- a potentially huge market for u.s. food, natural gas and more. it's a wealthy economy that american businesses haven't been able to crack. but japan is bogged down by its own political challenges. the country's agricultural interests are especially influential in its legislature, and they've resisted opening their ports to american rice, beef, pork and wheat -- which, in turn, has infuriated u.s. farmers. for more than a year, it's been a huge sticking point that has delayed progress on the deal. that's why the trans-pacific partnership debate isn't going away. trade agreements take years to come together. even after the presidents and prime ministers announce they've struck a deal, the wording must be scrubbed and translated into each country's language -- a process that takes months. then legislatures, where anger about their lack of a role in the negotiations has often simmered for years, might insist on changes. different countries' elections and changing political tides can complicate things even more. for some senators, the minority will be more fun the best-case scenario for obama is that the trans-pacific partnership could be approved by congress at the very end of his presidency. and that's if a deal can be struck soon -- which is unlikely. negotiators already blew their goal of reaching an agreement in 2012. then they missed their own deadline in 2013. and again in 2014. much more likely is that the next president will have decisions to make about whether and how to finalize the negotiations -- or, at least, whether to sign the deal.       can hillary clinton step out of bill's nafta shadow?      
__label__0 washington (cnn)is nra-backed donald trump going anti-gun? only for "bad people." trump said monday that he wants to take guns "away from criminals," and continued to praise the controversial stop-and-frisk policy during the first presidential debate, at hofstra university. "we have gangs roaming the street and in many cases they're illegally here, illegal immigrants, and they have guns and they shoot people," he told moderator lester holt of "nbc news." "and we have to be strong and we have to be vigilant. right now our police are afraid to do anything." he added: "we have to bring back law and order. now whether or not in a place like chicago you do stop-and-frisk, which worked very well, mayor giuliani is here, it worked very well in new york. it brought the crime rate very down. but you take the guns away from criminals who shouldn't be having it." stop-and-frisk is a type of aggressive policing that allows -- some say encourages -- officers to detain a person on virtually any type of vague suspicion, search that individual without a warrant and arrest the person if any kind of illegal substance or weapon is found. critics of the program questioned its constitutionality. they also pointed to the fact, documented in several studies, that the policy falls heaviest on black and latino men. holt said to trump: "stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in new york because it largely singled out black and hispanic men." "no, you're wrong," trump responded. "it went before a judge who was a very against-police judge. it was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. it would have won an appeal." "the argument is that it's a form racial profiling," holt said. "the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and that are bad people that shouldn't have them. these are felons, these are people that are bad people," trump said.       trump: we have to take the guns away from 'bad people'      
__label__0 (cnn)republican presidential nominee donald trump disputed monday that russia may be behind a series of cyberattacks on election systems in the us and on the democratic national committee -- a conclusion that us officials and lawmakers have come to. the new york real estate mogul questioned russian culpability in response to comments by democratic opponent hillary clinton at the first presidential debate pointing the finger at russia for recent breaches. "she says, 'russia, russia, russia,' " trump said. "it could be china. you don't know who broke into the dnc." he continued, "it also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds." but clinton said there was "no doubt" that russia has been responsible, an assessment top us security authorities and members of congressional intelligence committees support. "cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president," clinton warned at the event in hempstead, new york. recent hacks have targeted state election boards and the democratic national committee. the fbi is currently investigating. sen. dianne feinstein, a california democrat on the senate intelligence committee, and rep. adam schiff, a california democrat on the house intelligence committee, recently released a statement saying that "based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the us election." on monday, clinton also issued an implicit threat to russia that the us could hit back hard and would do so if necessary. "the united states has much greater capacity," clinton said, "and we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private sector information or our public sector information." "we don't want to have to use the kinds of tools we have, but we will defend the citizens of this country and the russians need to understand that," clinton said. clinton added that russia's suspected hacking attempts on us voting systems were one reason she was "so shocked when donald asked putin to hack into americans," a reference to trump's comments during a july news conference. "russia, if you're listening, i hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing" from the private server clinton used while secretary of state for official business and was later destroyed, trump said at that event. foreign policy issues were a relatively minor part of the debate, but each candidate tried to use national security issues to score points. trump claimed that clinton has done such a bad job of managing global crises and middle east conflict that she has been fighting isis her "whole life." the group that evolved into isis formed in 2006, while clinton was born in 1947. for her part, clinton targeted trump's claims that the us should consider letting south korea and japan manage their own defense without american support. "words matter," clinton said. "words matter when you run for president and they really matter when you are president, and i want to assure our allies in south korea and japan and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them." in response, trump qualified his position, saying, "as far as japan is concerned, i want to help our allies, but we cannot be the policeman of the world."       trump questions whether russia behind hacks      
__label__0 washington (cnn)when hillary clinton said that her republican rival donald trump had paid no federal income tax in some years, trump didn't deny it. in fact, he said: "that makes me smart." after the debate, he told cnn's jim acosta: "of course i've paid federal taxes." clinton was pressing trump for not releasing his tax returns for public scrutiny. trump has said he won't release his tax returns until a routine audit is complete, though every major party presidential candidate over the past 40 years have released tax returns. "there is something he is hiding," clinton said of trump during the debate. "or maybe he doesn't want the american people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax," she said. "that makes me smart," trump said. trump also said he would release his tax returns when clinton made public 33,000 emails that were deleted from her private email server.       trump: 'i'm smart' for not paying taxes

"maybe he's not as rich as he says he is ... there is something he's hiding ... who does he owe money to?" clinton speculating on why trump hasn't released his tax returns. 'good to be with you' clinton greets trump with a smile: "donald, it's good to be with you." 'trumped up, trickle down' "i call it 'trumped up, trickle down' because that's exactly what it would be," clinton on trump's economic plan. macarthur on isis plans "i don't think gen. douglas macarthur would like that," trump responding to clinton saying she has published her plan to defeat isis online. 'why not?' clinton: "i had a feeling by the end of this evening that i'd be blamed for everything." trump: "why not?" trump on irs audits "i'm not even complaining. i don't mind it. it's almost become a way of life," he said on being audited. clinton on her emails "i made a mistake using private email," clinton said. "that's for sure," trump added. 'own reality' "well, donald, i know you live in your own reality," clinton responding to trump's trade attack. trump on police reform "secretary clinton doesn't want to use a few words: law and order," he said. 'living in hell' "in inner cities, african-americans, hispanics, are living in hell because it's so dangerous. you walk down the street, you get shot," trump on crime. trump on holding back "i was going to say something extremely rough to hillary, to her family, and i said to myself, 'i can't do it. i just can't do it.' it's inappropriate. it's not nice,' " trump told cnn after the debate. quiz: are you more like clinton or trump?       clinton vs. trump: the most memorable one-liners      
__label__0 (cnn)hillary clinton's 2008 campaign manager dismissed as "absurd" donald trump's monday night debate claim that she admitted a campaign ally pushed "birther" conspiracy rumors. "it is absurd what donald trump just said," patti solis doyle said minutes after the debate's end. "i never sent anyone to kenya to look for his birth certificate." asked about his role in boosting and perpetuating birtherism earlier in the evening, trump pointed to a cnn appearance from last week, when -- as he put it -- solis doyle "was on wolf blitzer saying that this happened. (clinton confidant sidney) blumenthal sent mcclatchy, highly respected reporter at mcclatchy, to kenya to find out about it. they were pressing it very hard." no, hillary clinton did not start the 'birther' movement but as solis doyle said during the post-debate panel -- and a transcript from september 16 confirms -- she made no such claim. during her interview with cnn's wolf blitzer, solis doyle flatly denied the campaign had any role in creating the conspiracy theory, instead recalling the firing of a volunteer for forwarding a chain email suggesting obama was muslim. "there was a volunteer coordinator, i believe in late 2007, i think in december, one of our volunteer coordinators in one of the counties in iowa (who sent the email)," she said during the initial interview. "hillary made the decision immediately to let that person go. we let that person go. clinton puts trump on defense at first debate both then and on monday night, solis doyle said the clinton campaign apologized to the obama campaign, which accepted the explanation according to former obama political strategist david axelrod. "our campaign does not tolerate this kind of activity or campaigning," spokesman mo elleithee said at the time, after the email story initially went public in 2007. "as soon as it came to our attention, we asked (the second emailer) to step down."       patti solis doyle: clinton did not start birther movement      
__label__0 washington (cnn)donald trump said monday night he didn't pursue a line of criticism he could have during the debate, out of respect for democratic nominee hillary clinton's daughter, chelsea. "i'm really happy i was able to hold back on the indiscretions in respect to bill clinton. because i have a lot of respect for chelsea clinton," he told cnn's dana bash, who then asked what he would have said. "maybe i'll tell you at the next debate. we'll see. but i'm very happy," trump said. he added: "i think she'd be a poor president. i don't think she'd be do the job. we need somebody who will really be able to do the job. she doesn't have what it takes to make america great again." "i think it went better than i ever thought," he said. trump later said in another interview after the debate that clinton never gets anything "fixed." "she has been saying these things for years. and nothing ever happens. they never get fixed. it's all talk, no action," he said. the real estate mogul said the debate was "very exciting overall" and claimed online polls showed him doing well in the immediate aftermath of the debate. related: clinton puts trump on defense at first debate "i just think it was very exciting overall, dana," he told bash. "based on all of the online polls, we did tremendously." "you haven't had a real poll yet," bash said. "well, i mean, but the online polls were fantastic. hundreds of thousands of people are calling and voting," he said. a cnn/orc post-debate poll suggested debate watchers thought clinton had stronger performance. clinton was deemed the winner by a 62% to 27%, but the debate watchers surveyed were slightly more democratic than the general public.       trump: i held back on bill clinton's 'indiscretions' because of chelsea      
__label__0 what emerged, though, was in format and outward appearance similar to debates past -- two people behind lecterns -- only this time featuring what appeared to be a seasoned politician and a political novice. and it was trump, expected to earn points for style, who at times seemed rattled, one of several distractions related less to the content of what he said than the manner in which he delivered it. the give and take didn't make for a sterling night, necessarily, as political theater. but for those who concluded that hosting "the apprentice" would ready trump for this sort of exercise, well, it turns out those are very different muscles than the ones he had to put to use on monday night. clinton, clearly, came into the debate with a strategy that she prosecuted almost without deviation: the goal was to appear unflappable, relaxed and almost dismissive of trump's statements, while working in a few well-practiced zingers. that included pointing out that she had prepared for the debate, which offered a stark alternative to some of trump's riffing, disjointed answers. there were also some effective ad-libs, such as when she reacted to a rambling trump response by saying, "just listen to what you heard." related: one thing clinton and trump didn't debate: the debate itself trump, by contrast, having faced multiple rivals during the primaries, looked uncomfortable in this one-on-one format. with so many people on stage during the primaries, his attacking style could stand out; here, having to share the spotlight only with clinton, it was harder to employ that hit-and-run tactic. he interrupted clinton repeatedly -- at first to get in points, but as the debate progressed those interruptions increasingly felt like fits of pique, as if all the attack ads she's running against him (which he referenced) had gotten under his skin. trump's sniffling, which persisted throughout, also provided a distraction -- not a big deal, in theory, but the kind of thing teed up to be ridiculed in real time on social media. trump's attempts to steamroll through certain exchanges created some problems for the third person in this mini-drama, lester holt. holt, the "nbc nightly news" anchor, had perhaps the most unenviable task one could imagine, given all the hand-wringing that preceded it and the tuesday-morning quarterbacking that's sure to follow. holt acquitted himself well enough, occasionally fact-checking trump's statements -- usually when he sought to deny direct quotes that had been attributed to him -- and pressing him for specific answers. those few moments when he challenged the candidate likely won't sit well with trump's most ardent supporters, but holt at least avoided the notion that the moderator should be some sort of potted plant who asks questions and completely gets out of the way. to that extent, his performance offered a measure of redemption for nbc news. trump's impulse to look for one-liners also let him down when clinton hammered him for not releasing his tax returns. when clinton suggested that he might be hiding the fact that he hadn't paid any federal taxes, he interjected, "that makes me smart," a quip that was both ill considered and potentially problematic for him in the days ahead. related: nbc looks to lester holt for debate win after 2016 mishaps indeed, if trump is the more practiced performer, it didn't show. clinton maintained an appearance of calm while trump spoke, occasionally smiling but looking intent and engaged. trump adopted a steely-eyed squint in the early portion of the debate -- somewhere between clint eastwood and chuck norris -- but seemed less energetic as the evening wore on. prior to the debate, msnbc's rachel maddow noted that presidential debates are "the most unpredictable, the least scripted" of all major political events. as tv insiders know, reality television really isn't unscripted, and those programs benefit from the input of producers and editors in shaping storylines and the way characters are presented. in this first debate, anyway, clinton stuck to her script, and trump generally looked like he could have used a more detailed one.      donald trump's reality tv background doesn't help him in debate      
__label__0 hempstead, new york (cnn)hillary clinton stepped onto the debate stage monday night determined to show that only one candidate is ready to be president. clinton poked, prodded and quoted trump's own words, goading the famously thin-skinned republican nominee. trump took the bait, repeatedly interrupting angrily or dismissively throughout the night. he couldn't resist attacks, even when it was obvious they would backfire -- such as his criticism of clinton for dropping off the campaign trail ahead of the debate to prepare. cnn's reality check team vets the claims "yes, i did. and you know what else i prepared for?" clinton shot back. "i prepared to be president." here are six takeaways from the first presidential debate: trump takes the bait trump is the self-proclaimed counterpuncher, but it was clinton whose restraint was on display: she waited for trump to create an opening before she pounced. she let moderator lester holt grill trump about his refusal to release tax returns before delivering her own withering assessment of his insistence that a "routine audit" be completed first. "maybe he is not as rich as he says he is," clinton said. "maybe he is not as charitable as he claims to be... maybe he doesn't want the american people to know that he has paid nothing in federal taxes." "there is something he is hiding," she said. quiz: are you more like clinton or trump? trump lost his cool -- at a cost. he came close to admitting that he didn't pay federal taxes, saying that "makes me smart" and that the money "would be squandered" anyway. at another point, he insisted his refusal to pay contractors who'd done work for his businesses was smart. "i'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you," clinton said. trump, meanwhile, paid the price for his decision to wing it. unlike the gop primary debates, where trump would often disappear while other candidates bickered, only to interject with a zinger, he had no other candidates or aggressive moderators to save him -- and it showed. despite opportunities to do so, he never hit clinton on the 2012 benghazi attacks or clinton foundation donors' access to the state department, and he only briefly mentioned her use of a private email server. all three attacks -- elevated by trump himself at his rallies -- are at the core of the gop case that clinton is untrustworthy. trump's pitch to blue-collar voters trump's brightest spots came early in the debate, when he invoked clinton's 2012 praise of the trans-pacific partnership as the "gold standard" of trade deals. (clinton now opposes the deal.) "you were totally in favor of it," trump said. "then you heard what i was saying, how bad it is, and you said, 'i can't win that debate.'" it was part of a theme he worked hard to drive in the debate's early stages: clinton, he said, has been in washington for nearly 30 years, and has done little to improve economic conditions for americans -- a message that could resonate in manufacturing-heavy states like ohio and pennsylvania that are crucial to trump's electoral math. attacking clinton's comments on solar energy powering "new economic activity," trump said: "you've been doing this for 30 years. why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? for 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions." after a barrage of trump attacks, clinton sarcastically said, "i have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, i'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened." trump shot back: "why not?" trump's strained relationship with the truth trump lied repeatedly monday night -- including some real whoppers. when clinton claimed trump "thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese," trump shot back: "i do not say that. i do not say that." of course, trump did say that. on november 6, 2012, trump tweeted, "the concept of global warming was created by and for the chinese in order to make u.s. manufacturing non-competitive." it became the most-retweeted item on twitter during the debate. he called holt's factual citation of a 2002 interview in which trump endorsed the war in iraq "wrong, wrong, wrong," as fact-checkers disagreed. he falsely blamed clinton for birtherism. he said murder rates in new york city are climbing, when they are on the decline. and he said clinton had been fighting isis "her entire adult life." clinton was born in 1947; isis only formed in the mid-2000s. "i hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume," clinton said at one point. trump questions whether russia behind hacks clinton calls trump's behavior racist trump said he knew he'd face questions about his five-year history of birtherism. yet he had no new answers to offer. when holt asked why trump decided to finally acknowledge that president barack obama was born in the us, trump said it was because he wanted to change the topic. "i want to get on to defeating isis, because i want to get on to creating jobs, because i want to get on to having a strong border, because i want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country," he said. while falsely blaming clinton's 2008 presidential campaign for the questions about obama's birth, trump also took credit for bringing up the non-issue in the first place. "i was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate," he said. "and i think i did a good job." clinton responded by turning the spotlight back on her gop foe. "well, just listen to what you heard," clinton said. she pointed to the 1970s justice department lawsuits that trump faced over accusations of racial discrimination in housing properties he owned. "he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior," clinton said. "and the birther lie was a very hurtful one." trump's misplaced aggression trump has long polled better with men than women -- and that gap could grow after monday night's debate. he interrupted clinton dozens of times, and talked over holt when he tried to interject. he blasted clinton's "stamina." and when clinton attacked trump over his remarks about women, trump proved her point by digging in against an old foe. "rosie o'donnell, i said very tough things to her, and i think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her," trump said. he zealously defended himself, but didn't attack clinton with the same gusto. and because of it, clinton was able to easily move past potential problem areas. asked about her use of a private email server during her tenure at the state department, clinton gave a shorter, simpler answer than she has before. "i'm not going to make any excuses, it was a mistake," she said. trump shot back that it was "more than a mistake. that was done purposely." but then he dropped the topic. later, he briefly came back to it, saying he'd release his tax returns "against my lawyers' wishes," under one condition: "i will release them as soon as she releases her 33,000 emails." the crowd cheered, violating holt's admonition to keep silent. and then, again, trump moved on -- never mentioning that james comey, the fbi director, also harshly criticized clinton's email practices, and never again returning to the topic. they really don't like each other... ...and it shows. with two debates to go, this is going to get nastier. a preview of what's in store came at the end, when clinton -- attacking trump's treatment of women -- called him "a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs." she said he'd referred to a latina beauty contestant as "miss piggy. then he called her miss housekeeping." an agitated trump twice asked, "where did you find this?" the woman, 1996 miss universe alicia machado of venezuela, told the new york times and "inside edition" this year that trump repeatedly mocked her weight. who is alicia machado? former miss universe said trump called her miss piggy trump went into the spin room after the debate -- a move unheard of at general election debates - and credited himself with not taking a shot at bill clinton's extramarital affairs. he told fox news conservative host and trump supporter sean hannity afterward that it seemed inappropriate with bill and chelsea clinton in the front row -- but implied he might in the future. for clinton's campaign, the challenge will be turning a debate-night victory into sustained success -- pressing the same themes in the days ahead as she attempts to reverse trump's climb in national and battleground state polls. trump will have to wait until oct. 9 for another shot at clinton.       6 takeaways from the first presidential debate      
__label__0 (cnn)republican presidential nominee donald trump complained after monday night's debate that his microphone wasn't working -- and he questioned whether that was happening on purpose. "and they also had, gave me a defective mic. did you notice that? my mic was defective within the room," he told a group of reporters afterward. "no, but i wonder, was that on purpose? was that on purpose? but i had a mic that wasn't worked properly, with, working properly within the room." trump kept up his complaints about the microphone the morning after the debate, and continued to suggest that it had been tampered with. "i had a problem with a microphone that didn't work. i don't know if you saw that in the room. my microphone was terrible. i wonder was it set up that way on purpose. my microphone in the room, they couldn't hear me, you know, it was going on and off. which isn't exactly great. i wonder if it was set up that way, but it was terrible. when i tested, it was beautiful, like an hour before, i said what a great mic." trump went on, "it was going on and off and it was much lower than hers. i don't want to believe in conspiracy theories, of course, but it was much lower than hers and it was crackling and she didn't have that problem. that to me was a bad problem, you have a bum mic, that's not exactly good." this isn't the first time trump has attacked a faulty microphone. in january at a rally in florida, he complained several times about his microphone. "stupid mic keeps popping," he said at the time.       trump complains about debate mic      
__label__0 (cnn)hillary clinton was deemed the winner of monday night's debate by 62% of voters who tuned in to watch, while just 27% said they thought donald trump had the better night, according to a cnn/orc poll of voters who watched the debate. that drubbing is similar to mitt romney's dominant performance over president barack obama in the first 2012 presidential debate. voters who watched said clinton expressed her views more clearly than trump and had a better understanding of the issues by a margin of more than 2-to-1. clinton also was seen as having done a better job addressing concerns voters might have about her potential presidency by a 57% to 35% margin, and as the stronger leader by a 56% to 39% margin. read: the complete full cnn/orc poll results the gap was smaller on which candidate appeared more sincere and authentic, though still broke in clinton's favor, with 53% saying she was more sincere vs. 40% who felt trump did better on that score. trump topped clinton 56% to 33% as the debater who spent more time attacking their opponent. although the survey suggested debate watchers were more apt to describe themselves as democrats than the overall pool of voters, even independents who watched deemed clinton the winner, 54% vs. 33% who thought trump did the best job in the debate. and the survey suggests clinton outperformed the expectations of those who watched. while pre-debate interviews indicated these watchers expected clinton to win by a 26-point margin, that grew to 35 points in the post-debate survey. quiz: are you more like clinton or trump? about half in the poll say the debate did not have an effect on their voting plans, 47% said it didn't make a difference, but those who say they were moved by it tilted in clinton's direction, 34% said the debate made them more apt to vote for clinton, 18% more likely to back trump. on the issues, voters who watched broadly say clinton would do a better job handling foreign policy, 62% to 35%, and most think she would be the better candidate to handle terrorism, 54% to 43% who prefer trump. but on the economy, the split is much closer, with 51% saying they favor clinton's approach vs. 47% who prefer trump. most debate watchers came away from monday's face-off with doubts about trump's ability to handle the presidency. overall, 55% say they didn't think trump would be able to handle the job of president, 43% said they thought he would. among political independents who watched the debate, it's a near-even split, 50% say he can handle it, 49% that he can't. cnn's reality check team vets the claims in the first presidential debate and voters who watched were more apt to see trump's attacks on clinton as unfair than they were to see her critiques that way. about two-thirds of debate viewers, 67%, said clinton's critiques of trump were fair, while just 51% said the same of trump. assessments of trump's attacks on clinton were sharply split by gender, with 58% of men seeing them as fair compared with 44% of women who watched on monday. there was almost no gender divide in perceptions of whether clinton's attacks were fair. the cnn/orc post-debate poll includes interviews with 521 registered voters who watched the september 26 debate. results among debate-watchers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. respondents were originally interviewed as part of a september 23-25 telephone survey of a random sample of americans, and indicated they planned to watch the debate and would be willing to be re-interviewed when it was over.       post-debate poll: hillary clinton takes round one      
__label__0 washington (cnn)former "miss universe" alicia machado said she cried when she heard democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton talk about her during the first presidential debate at hofstra university monday. "well, last night i was with my family, with my mom and with my daughter, we were watching the debate and you know, i was really surprised," she said in spanish during a phone call with reporters set up by the clinton campaign. "and i started crying. i started crying because i never imagined that such an important person like her would care about my story, know about my story." machado was referencing a moment during the debate when clinton slammed donald trump's for his past comments toward women -- which has become a key campaign issue that hits on his vulnerabilities with both hispanics and women. "and one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest -- he loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them -- and he called this woman 'miss piggy,' then he called her 'miss housekeeping' because she was latina," clinton had said. she continued: "donald, she has a name. her name is alicia machado. and she has become a us citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this november." trump, seemingly caught off-guard, repeatedly interjected: "where did you find this?" clinton, according to aides, had been prepped on machado's story going into the debate and aimed to use it as a way to counter sexism on trump's part. the democratic nominee's campaign quickly turned the exchange into what they hoped would be a lasting moment: they published a video about the former beauty pageant winner shortly after the debate, in addition to holding the press call. "i lament that i could be an uncomfortable person for mr. trump, but that's how things were," machado said in the phone call. "and i know very well what's he's capable of, this man. and that's why i am fighting to make the community understand, now more than ever, that latinos need to support the us, that we need to return all the beautiful and grand things the us has provided for us." when asked how the back-and-forth has played with spanish speaking media, a clinton aide had a one-word response: "h-u-g-e." on tuesday, trump refused to back down from his criticism of machado, telling "fox and friends" in an interview that machado had "gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem." "she was the winner and you know, she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem. we had a real problem," trump said. "not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so hillary went back into the years and she found this girl -- this was many years ago. and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother theresa. and it wasn't quite that way but that's ok. hillary has to do what she has to do." beauty queen encouraged to lose weight machado competed and won the "miss universe" title representing venezuela in 1996 when she was 19 years old -- but then she gained nearly 60 pounds, according to a cnn report at the time. "some people when they have pressure eat too much. like me. like alicia," trump said at the time. he was then executive producer of the miss universe pageant. in 1997, rumors surfaced that machado would be forced to give up her miss universe crown -- but trump said he wouldn't let it happen, according to the cnn report. "we had a choice of: termination or do this," he said at the time. "we wanted to do this." by "this," he meant encourage her to lose weight. machado told inside edition in may that she actually gained closer to 15 pounds and that trump called her "miss housekeeping," because she is latina, and "miss piggy." it made her feel "so fat" that it made her "very depressed," she said. trump told the new york times that he pushed her to lose weight. "to that, i will plead guilty," he said." but machado said that she was affected by the comments. "after that episode, i was sick, had anorexia and bulimia for five years," she said. "over the past 20 years, i've gone to a lot of psychologists to combat this." on monday, after the presidential debate, she tweeted in spanish, "thank you mrs. hillary clinton your respect for women and our differences make you great! i'm with you!" she later tweeted, "i received my passport ! i'm ready to vote for my country for you @hillaryclinton for my daughter for women workers". cnn's dan merica and david wright contributed to this report.

__label__0 "i thought lester did a great job. honestly, i thought lester did a great job," trump told cnnmoney shortly after the debate was over. when asked if the questions had been fair, trump replied: "yeah, i thought it was very fair." trump's positive assessment of the moderator was matched by his own campaign manager, who said holt "did a great job as a moderator under tough circumstances," as well as many media critics and observers on social media. related: monday night ranks as the 'most tweeted debate ever' but even as the candidate said that, an opposite consensus was building among his supporters, surrogates and members of the conservative media. "lester holt clearly heard the cries of his colleagues in the liberal media to be tough on trump and ease up on hillary loud and clear," brent bozell, the president of the right-wing watchdog media research center, said in a statement. "lester holt failed in his role as a moderator. period." drudge report, the influential conservative aggregator, led its site with stories from heat street and washington examiner that claimed holt had been "the third debater," and that his fact-checking was "opinion journalism." to be sure, holt interrupted trump more often than clinton and fact-checked trump more often than clinton -- though it should be noted that trump went over his allotted time more often and said more statements that were factually inaccurate. related: donald trump's reality tv background doesn't help him in debate for most of the debate, however, holt held back, allowing the two candidates to debate -- a move that was in line with the expectations of the commission on presidential debates. "points to lester holt for standing aside and letting trump and clinton go at it," adam nagourney, the new york times' los angeles bureau chief, wrote on twitter. others questioned his absence: "apparently lester holt went to the bathroom, way down the hall, and only one urinal is available and there is a line," national review columnists jim geraghty tweeted. as the debate wore on, however, holt stepped up to fact-check trump on claims about his refusal to release his tax returns, his claim that he opposed the iraq war and his history of questioning president barack obama's citizenship.      donald trump: 'lester holt did a great job'      
__label__0 (cnn)donald trump reiterated his view that hillary clinton "doesn't have the stamina" to be president during monday night's debate. "she doesn't have the look. she doesn't have the stamina, i said she doesn't have the stamina, and i don't believe she does have the stamina," trump said. fact checking the debate the debate moderator, nbc's lester holt, asked trump to clarify what he meant when he said earlier this month that his democratic rival didn't have "a presidential look." trump's women problem "i just don't believe she has a presidential look, and you need a presidential look," trump had told abc news' david muir in an interview. clinton responded: "as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee he can talk to me about stamina." the most memorable one-liners from the debate clinton, the first woman to be nominated as a candidate for a major political party in us history, pointed out trump pivoted from saying she doesn't look like a presidential candidate to saying she doesn't have the stamina. "he tried to switch from looks to stamina, but this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs," clinton said in response to trump. the debate in 140 characters (and more) trump defended the comments, which he said were about rosie o'donnell. "i said very tough things to (o'donnell), and i think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her," trump said. "but you want to know the truth, i was going to say something extremely rough to hillary, to her family, and i said to myself, 'i just can't do it.' "       trump: clinton 'doesn't have the stamina' to be president      
__label__0 (cnn)hillary clinton forced donald trump onto defense over his temperament, refusal to release his taxes and his past comments about race and women during a fiery debut presidential debate monday -- a potentially pivotal moment in a tight election campaign. clinton, who has seen her dominance of the presidential race fade in the weeks since the democratic convention, delivered a strong performance in which she demonstrated a command of policy and a sense of humor, smiling through some of trump's strongest attacks. she delivered the best zinger of the night in response to criticism from trump for staying off the campaign trail recently. "i think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate," she said. "and yes, i did. and you know what else i prepared for? i prepared to be president. and that is a good thing." trump came out swinging at the beginning of the debate, and made some effective points on the economy and jobs -- some of the aspects of his outsider presidential campaign that have struck a chord with many americans. but the debate highlighted trump's tendency to make false claims as he made inaccurate statements on everything from laws regarding policing, his support for the iraq war and his contention that clinton was behind the so-called birther conspiracy. cnn's reality check team vets the claims at the first debate appearing in the "spin room" after the debate to talk to journalists, trump said he was happy with his performance. "it went better than i ever thought," he told cnn's dana bash. a cnn/orc poll of debate watchers released after the event found 62% felt clinton won compared to 27% for trump. the poll suggests the debate audience was a bit more democratic than the public as a whole, about on par with the democratic tilt in the audience that watched the first debate in 2008 between obama and john mccain. one of the most powerful moments of the debate came when the conversation focused on the so-called birther debate following trump's recent acknowledgment that president barack obama was born in the us -- a fact that has been evident for years. with trump standing just a few feet from her, clinton blasted him for perpetuating a "racist lie." "he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior," clinton said as trump shook his head. trump hit back, noting clinton's tough critiques of obama during their bitter 2008 primary battle. 'holier than thou' "you treated him with terrible disrespect and i watch the way you talk now about how lovely everything is ... it doesn't work that way," he said. "when you try to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work." as the debate ended, clinton hammered trump over his treatment of women. "this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs," clinton said. she accused trump of calling a latina contestant in a beauty contest "miss piggy" and a housekeeper because of her ethnicity, seemingly throwing trump off as he twice asked "where did you find this?" who is alicia machado? former miss universe said trump called her miss piggy clinton repeatedly sought to correct trump's statements -- going so far as referring viewers to fact checks on her website -- as she aimed to portray him as out of touch with the complexities of the american economy. "i know you live in your own reality," she told trump. clinton and trump opened the debate on a positive note by shaking hands before stationing themselves behind their podiums at hofstra university on new york's long island. their spouses, former president bill clinton and melania trump, also greeted each other before taking their seats in the debate hall. from there, the drama quickly unfolded. an increasingly angry trump slammed clinton for putting her plans to fight isis on her website -- and thereby tipping off america's enemy. "well, at least i have a plan to fight isis," clinton responded, referring to his previous statements that he has a "secret" plan to destroy the terrorist group. battling over taxes clinton also hit trump over his refusal to release his tax returns. "why won't he release his tax returns?" clinton asked. "maybe he is not as rich as he says he is," she went on. "maybe he is not as charitable as he claims to be," "maybe he doesn't want the american people to know that he has paid nothing in federal taxes." clinton pressed trump on the issue, saying "there is something he is hiding." trump replied that he would release his taxes when clinton made public 33,000 emails that were deleted from her private email server. when clinton said that trump had paid no federal income tax in some years, trump replied "that makes me smart." clinton also set about trump's business record, pointing out that he had called himself "the king of debt" and accusing him of "stiffing" thousand of contractors who did work for his business. when the debate turned to racial issues and crime, clinton said that it was important for police to work together with local communities to restore trust. trump accused clinton of refusing to say the phrase "law and order" and bemoaned the state of inner cities. he said that african-americans and hispanics were "living in hell." "you walk down the street, you get shot," trump said. clinton rebuked trump for painting "such a dire picture" of black communities. campaign at a critical point trump and clinton are facing off with the campaign at a critical point, as the race is a dead heat just 43 days before election day. a cnn/orc poll released monday found trump edging clinton 42% to 41% in the crucial battleground state of colorado among likely voters in a four-way race. in pennsylvania, another key state, the poll found clinton in a virtual tie against trump among likely voters at 45% to 44%. the former secretary of state is relying on both states to help pave her way to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the white house. nationally, cnn's poll of polls finds clinton and trump neck-and-neck 44%-42%. debate prep the rivals spent the day preparing for their big battle. clinton participated in mock debates with her tart-tongued former aide philippe reines playing trump. in one practice debate, reines assumed the character of the unpredictable nominee by praising clinton for her role as a pioneer for women, campaign sources said. reines even wore the kind of signature red tie that trump favors and adopted his characteristic hand gestures in a bid to fully prepare clinton for her unpredictable foe. the republican nominee has watched videos of clinton, but his preparation has been less intense than his opponent's, in keeping with his more freewheeling style. he did not hold mock debates, for instance, with someone standing in for clinton. cnn's dana bash, dylan byers and sara murray contributed to this report      clinton puts trump on defense at first debate

"and i know very well what's he's capable of, this man. and that's why i am fighting to make the community understand, now more than ever, that latinos need to support the us, that we need to return all the beautiful and grand things the us has provided for us." when asked how the back-and-forth has played with spanish speaking media, a clinton aide had a one-word response: "h-u-g-e." on tuesday, trump refused to back down from his criticism of machado, telling "fox and friends" in an interview that machado had "gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem." "she was the winner and you know, she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem. we had a real problem," trump said. "not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so hillary went back into the years and she found this girl -- this was many years ago. and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother theresa. and it wasn't quite that way but that's ok. hillary has to do what she has to do." beauty queen encouraged to lose weight machado competed and won the "miss universe" title representing venezuela in 1996 when she was 19 years old -- but then she gained nearly 60 pounds, according to a cnn report at the time. "some people when they have pressure eat too much. like me. like alicia," trump said at the time. he was then executive producer of the miss universe pageant. in 1997, rumors surfaced that machado would be forced to give up her miss universe crown -- but trump said he wouldn't let it happen, according to the cnn report. "we had a choice of: termination or do this," he said at the time. "we wanted to do this." by "this," he meant encourage her to lose weight. machado told inside edition in may that she actually gained closer to 15 pounds and that trump called her "miss housekeeping," because she is latina, and "miss piggy." it made her feel "so fat" that it made her "very depressed," she said. trump told the new york times that he pushed her to lose weight. "to that, i will plead guilty," he said." but machado said that she was affected by the comments. "after that episode, i was sick, had anorexia and bulimia for five years," she said. "over the past 20 years, i've gone to a lot of psychologists to combat this." on monday, after the presidential debate, she tweeted in spanish, "thank you mrs. hillary clinton your respect for women and our differences make you great! i'm with you!" she later tweeted, "i received my passport ! i'm ready to vote for my country for you @hillaryclinton for my daughter for women workers". cnn's dan merica and david wright contributed to this report.

__label__0 (cnn)hillary clinton forced donald trump onto defense over his temperament, refusal to release his taxes and his past comments about race and women during a fiery debut presidential debate monday -- a potentially pivotal moment in a tight election campaign. clinton, who has seen her dominance of the presidential race fade in the weeks since the democratic convention, delivered a strong performance in which she demonstrated a command of policy and a sense of humor, smiling through some of trump's strongest attacks. she delivered the best zinger of the night in response to criticism from trump for staying off the campaign trail recently. "i think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate," she said. "and yes, i did. and you know what else i prepared for? i prepared to be president. and that is a good thing." trump came out swinging at the beginning of the debate, and made some effective points on the economy and jobs -- some of the aspects of his outsider presidential campaign that have struck a chord with many americans. but the debate highlighted trump's tendency to make false claims as he made inaccurate statements on everything from laws regarding policing, his support for the iraq war and his contention that clinton was behind the so-called birther conspiracy. cnn's reality check team vets the claims at the first debate appearing in the "spin room" after the debate to talk to journalists, trump said he was happy with his performance. "it went better than i ever thought," he told cnn's dana bash. a cnn/orc poll of debate watchers released after the event found 62% felt clinton won compared to 27% for trump. the poll suggests the debate audience was a bit more democratic than the public as a whole, about on par with the democratic tilt in the audience that watched the first debate in 2008 between obama and john mccain. one of the most powerful moments of the debate came when the conversation focused on the so-called birther debate following trump's recent acknowledgment that president barack obama was born in the us -- a fact that has been evident for years. with trump standing just a few feet from her, clinton blasted him for perpetuating a "racist lie." "he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior," clinton said as trump shook his head. trump hit back, noting clinton's tough critiques of obama during their bitter 2008 primary battle. 'holier than thou' "you treated him with terrible disrespect and i watch the way you talk now about how lovely everything is ... it doesn't work that way," he said. "when you try to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work." as the debate ended, clinton hammered trump over his treatment of women. "this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs," clinton said. she accused trump of calling a latina contestant in a beauty contest "miss piggy" and a housekeeper because of her ethnicity, seemingly throwing trump off as he twice asked "where did you find this?" who is alicia machado? former miss universe said trump called her miss piggy clinton repeatedly sought to correct trump's statements -- going so far as referring viewers to fact checks on her website -- as she aimed to portray him as out of touch with the complexities of the american economy. "i know you live in your own reality," she told trump. clinton and trump opened the debate on a positive note by shaking hands before stationing themselves behind their podiums at hofstra university on new york's long island. their spouses, former president bill clinton and melania trump, also greeted each other before taking their seats in the debate hall. from there, the drama quickly unfolded. an increasingly angry trump slammed clinton for putting her plans to fight isis on her website -- and thereby tipping off america's enemy. "well, at least i have a plan to fight isis," clinton responded, referring to his previous statements that he has a "secret" plan to destroy the terrorist group. battling over taxes clinton also hit trump over his refusal to release his tax returns. "why won't he release his tax returns?" clinton asked. "maybe he is not as rich as he says he is," she went on. "maybe he is not as charitable as he claims to be," "maybe he doesn't want the american people to know that he has paid nothing in federal taxes." clinton pressed trump on the issue, saying "there is something he is hiding." trump replied that he would release his taxes when clinton made public 33,000 emails that were deleted from her private email server. when clinton said that trump had paid no federal income tax in some years, trump replied "that makes me smart." clinton also set about trump's business record, pointing out that he had called himself "the king of debt" and accusing him of "stiffing" thousand of contractors who did work for his business. when the debate turned to racial issues and crime, clinton said that it was important for police to work together with local communities to restore trust. trump accused clinton of refusing to say the phrase "law and order" and bemoaned the state of inner cities. he said that african-americans and hispanics were "living in hell." "you walk down the street, you get shot," trump said. clinton rebuked trump for painting "such a dire picture" of black communities. campaign at a critical point trump and clinton are facing off with the campaign at a critical point, as the race is a dead heat just 43 days before election day. a cnn/orc poll released monday found trump edging clinton 42% to 41% in the crucial battleground state of colorado among likely voters in a four-way race. in pennsylvania, another key state, the poll found clinton in a virtual tie against trump among likely voters at 45% to 44%. the former secretary of state is relying on both states to help pave her way to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the white house. nationally, cnn's poll of polls finds clinton and trump neck-and-neck 44%-42%. debate prep the rivals spent the day preparing for their big battle. clinton participated in mock debates with her tart-tongued former aide philippe reines playing trump. in one practice debate, reines assumed the character of the unpredictable nominee by praising clinton for her role as a pioneer for women, campaign sources said. reines even wore the kind of signature red tie that trump favors and adopted his characteristic hand gestures in a bid to fully prepare clinton for her unpredictable foe. the republican nominee has watched videos of clinton, but his preparation has been less intense than his opponent's, in keeping with his more freewheeling style. he did not hold mock debates, for instance, with someone standing in for clinton. cnn's dana bash, dylan byers and sara murray contributed to this report      clinton puts trump on defense at first debate      
__label__0 washington (cnn)president barack obama said saturday that the new smithsonian museum devoted to african-american history elevates the often-overlooked impact of black americans and will help others better understand the breadth of the american story. "this national museum helps to tell a richer and fuller story of who we are," obama, the first african-american president, said at the national museum of african-american history and culture. "by knowing this other story we better understand ourselves and each other. it binds us together. it reaffirms that all of us are america, that african-american history is not somehow separate from our larger american story," he added. "it is central to the american story." saturday's opening ceremony for the museum also was attended by civil rights icon rep. john lewis, former presidents george w. bush and bill clinton and chief justice john roberts. thousands are expected to have descended on the national mall this weekend to celebrate the museum's opening. calling it an "act of patriotism" to understand african-american history and the struggles of all americans, obama said "a great nation doesn't shy away from the truth." "we're not a burden on america or a stain on america or an object of shame and pity for america. we are america," obama said. "and that's what this museum explains." "hopefully, this museum makes us talk to each other and listen to each other and see each other," he added. obama also said the museum can provide context to the current national debate on the relationship between law enforcement and black communities that recently made headlines following the police shooting deaths of black men in tulsa, oklahoma, and charlotte, north carolina. "perhaps it can help a white visitor understand the pain and anger of demonstrators in places like ferguson (missouri) and charlotte. but it can also help black visitors appreciate the fact that not only is this younger generation carrying on traditions of the past, but within the white communities across the nation, we see the sincerity of law enforcement officers and officials who, in fits and starts, are struggling to understand and trying to do the right thing," he said. "it reminds us that routine discrimination and jim crow aren't ancient history. it's just a blink in the eye of history," obama continued. star-studded event saturday's event included musical performances by stevie wonder, patti labelle and denyce graves, as well as appearances by robert de niro and angela bassett, who read the words of black poets and historians. related: congressman: black history museum is 'an american story' the effort to bring this museum to life began decades ago but was finally set in motion in 2003 when bush signed a bill creating it. ground was broken in february 2012. the smithsonian says the museum is the only one in the us exclusively focused on african-american life, history and culture, but organizers say it is also meant to capture the story of all americans. one of those who have worked for years to see this museum come to life is educator and historian lonnie bunch, founding director for the museum. asked what does it mean to him to see it finally open, he said, "it means that finally the african-american story on the national mall is accessible to everybody, and in many ways it means that my ancestors are smiling," he told cnn. "this is framed in a way that this is everybody's story. it is not a black people's story. it is a story of america." slavery and freedom at focus officials said the chronicling of slavery and freedom are the centerpiece of the museum. that exhibit contains such items as a slave cabin from south carolina, a bill of sale for a 16-year-old girl for $600, shackles used on slaves and a copy of the emancipation proclamation. related: clinton, trump navigate politics of police violence there is also an exhibition focusing on the fight against segregation, which discusses the era from end of reconstruction through the civil rights movement. here, visitors see such things as abolitionist harriet tubman's hymn book to a dress rosa parks was making shortly before she was arrested for not giving up her seat on a segregated bus; a tuskegee airplane used to train african-american pilots for world war ii flights; a segregated pullman train car as well as a stool from the woolworth store where there were sit-ins in greensboro, north carolina, in 1960; and separate water fountains. a separate section examines the civil rights movement, the black power era of the 1960s and 1970s and other activism remembering many activists, including lewis and dr. martin luther king. the museum holds more than 3,000 artifacts -- with many contributed from ordinary americans from across the country. there are also tens of thousands of other artifacts which have been contributed which could be rotated later into exhibition space. obama on trump: 'even most 8-year-olds' know slavery was a bad time for black people there are also many iconic items celebrating the achievements in sports, music, television and film including michael jackson's fedora hat worn during his 1984 "victory tour," boxer muhammad ali's headgear, musician chuck berry's cadillac, baseball star jackie robinson's bat, some of olympian gabby douglas' items as well as a statue honoring american athletes who held their hands up as a demonstration of solidarity during the 1968 gold medal ceremony. obama featured one exhibit honors the legacy of obama's election. during an interview airing friday, he voiced his appreciation for all of those whose work helped make the museum happen. "we were an outgrowth of frederick douglass and white abolitionists who partnered with him," obama told abc news. "we were the consequence of these freedom riders. of all races. young people idealistically coming down here and being willing to challenge an unjust system." also interesting is the design of the building. sitting next to the washington monument on the national mall, the exterior is made up of 3,600 bronze-colored panels. the architects of the building drew on imagery from both african and american history for the outer layer, saying they were trying to reach towards the sky to express faith, hope and resiliency. the building is three-tiered and is inspired by a traditional wooden column that features a crown or corona -- or african headdress -- at the top. at night, the corona glows from the light within the building. cnn's kevin liptak contributed to this report.      obama: african-american museum helps tell fuller story of america      
__label__0 washington (cnn)the cincinnati enquirer, one of ohio's largest newspapers, is backing hillary clinton after supporting republican presidential candidates for nearly a century. "the enquirer has supported republicans for president for almost a century -- a tradition this editorial board doesn't take lightly. but this is not a traditional race, and these are not traditional times," the editorial board of the enquirer published friday. "our country needs calm, thoughtful leadership to deal with the challenges we face at home and abroad. we need a leader who will bring out the best in all americans, not the worst." "that's why there is only one choice when we elect a president in november: hillary clinton," the editorial reads. the gannett publication announced its endorsement in advance of the first presidential debate between the two nominees. ohio is a battleground state that both candidates have increasingly worked harder to win. the paper said clinton was a "competent" secretary of state who made "mistakes" in benghazi that were "tragic" but called republicans' assessment of her actions a "diabolical conspiracy." "clinton, meanwhile, was a competent secretary of state, with far stronger diplomatic skills than she gets credit for. yes, mistakes were made in benghazi, and it was tragic that four americans lost their lives in the 2012 terror attacks on the us consulate there," it wrote. "but the incident was never the diabolical conspiracy that republicans wanted us to believe, and clinton was absolved of blame after lengthy investigations." republican presidential nominee donald trump is more interested in his self that the country, the paper concludes. "trump brands himself as an outsider untainted by special interests, but we see a man utterly corrupted by self-interest. his narcissistic bid for the presidency is more about making himself great than america," the board said. "trump tears our country and many of its people down with his words so that he can build himself up. what else are we left to believe about a man who tells the american public that he alone can fix what ails us?" while the editorial board are sympathetic to voters interest in the change that trump could bring, the enquirer concludes that not all change is good. "our country needs to seek thoughtful change, not just change for the sake of change. four years is plenty of time to do enough damage that it could take america years to recover from, if at all," it wrote.       major ohio paper endorses clinton after years of backing gop      
__label__0 (cnn)a federal appeals court ruled friday that ohio's method of removing names from its voter rolls violates federal law, and sent the case back to the district court for a remedy. the ruling by the sixth circuit court of appeals is a victory for the american civil liberties union of ohio and other groups who had argued the program violated the national voter registration act and expressed concern that the purge would effect "many thousands" of ohio voters. they hope the lower court will move quickly to direct that names that were improperly removed should be put back on the voting list or that voters not on the list be allowed to file a provisional ballot. the appeals court said that ohio's so-called "supplemental process," where "a voter is purged from the rolls after six years of inactivity -- even if he or she did not move and otherwise remains eligible to vote," is in violation of the nvra. "we are very happy that the court found that (secretary of state jon husted's) process of purging voters in ohio is illegal and must stop," mike brickner, senior policy director at the aclu, said in a statement. "we don't believe that any voters should be removed from the rolls simply because they haven't voted in a few elections." friday's ruling reverses a district court ruling that had gone in favor of secretary of state jon husted. the lower court had held that ohio's "public interest is being served" and that the "procedures of maintaining the voter registration rolls ensure the integrity of the election process. " in a statement, husted said the ruling "overturns 20 years of ohio law and practice, which has been carried out by the last four secretaries of state, both democrat and republican." he questioned how the lower court -- charged with finding an appropriate remedy -- will proceed. "it is one thing to strike down a longstanding procedure; it is another to craft a workable remedy. to that end, if the final resolution requires us to reinstate voting eligibility to individuals who have died or moved out of ohio, we will appeal."       federal appeals court: ohio's removal of voters violates law      
__label__0 (cnn)president barack obama sharply criticized republican presidential nominee donald trump for saying earlier this week that the black community is in the worst shape it's "ever been in before." "i think even most 8-year-olds will tell you that whole slavery thing wasn't very good for black people," obama told abc news in an interview that aired friday on "good morning america." "jim crow wasn't very good for black people. what we have to do is use our history to propel us to make even more progress in the future." obama's comments reflected the wide gulf between the president and trump that came into greater focus this week as race again became a top issue in the 2016 campaign following fatal police shootings of african-american men in oklahoma and north carolina. speaking before a mostly white audience tuesday in kenansville, north carolina, trump spoke of the need to "rebuild our inner cities." "our african-american communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before. ever. ever. ever," trump said. the speech was part of a high-profile push by the trump campaign to plug gaps in poll numbers with minority voters, and also to win over white voters turned off by divisive rhetoric from trump that critics have repeatedly labeled as racist. still, the effort has stumbled. by proposing the expansion of the controversial "stop-and-frisk" program as a way to improve urban policing -- and by engaging in a public re-litigation of the baseless "birther" controversy that critics labeled racist -- trump spent much of the last week doing damage control with the same voters he'd hoped to attract. all the while, obama has positioned himself as one of trump's most vocal critics -- and rival hillary clinton's biggest cheerleader. speaking to reporters gathered in the oval office last friday, obama sarcastically dismissed trump's "birther" capitulation. "i was pretty confident about where i was born, i think most people were as well," he said. "my hope would be the presidential election reflects more serious issues than that." and the president made a more earnest effort to rebut trump when he spoke at the congressional black caucus gala on saturday, and said that he would consider it a "personal insult" to his legacy if black voters didn't turn out for clinton. newest absentee, registration numbers promising for clinton "if i hear anybody saying their vote does not matter, that it doesn't matter who we elect -- read up on your history. it matters. we've got to get people to vote," obama said. "i will consider it a personal insult -- an insult to my legacy -- if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. you want to give me a good sendoff? go vote." at the event, obama also criticized trump for using hyperbolic language when discussing african-americans, and suggested that trump visit the smithsonian's new national museum of african american history and culture for perspective. "you may have heard hillary's opponent in this election say that there's never been a worse time to be a black person. i mean, he missed that whole civics lesson about slavery or jim crow," he said. "but we've got a museum for him to visit, so he can tune in. we will educate him." obama speaks at the museum's opening friday.       obama on trump: 'even most 8-year-olds' know slavery was a bad time for black people      
__label__0 washington (cnn)texas sen. ted cruz concluded months of animosity between him and donald trump on friday by saying he will vote for the gop nominee. but between the party-line camaraderie that friday brought and the "bromance" from the initial stretch of the election, the two bitterly battled it out for the nomination. here are some of the more notable -- and inflammatory -- salvos the two exchanged while on the campaign trail. 'lyin' ted' the attack trump most frequently deployed against cruz was the nickname the real estate mogul turned politician used to describe his competition: "lyin' ted." trump routinely dropped that moniker on cruz. candidates' spouses take the heat in an election season defined by vicious and often personal attacks, not even the candidates' wives were safe, evidenced by trump's tweet about cruz's wife, heidi cruz. the march spat came after a facebook advertisement targeted to mormons showed an old photo of trump's wife, melania, posing nude. the ad, however, was produced by an anti-trump super pac, which had no known connection to the cruz campaign. trump, however, didn't see a difference. "lyin' ted cruz just used a picture of melania from a g.q. shoot in his ad. be careful, lyin' ted, or i will spill the beans on your wife!" trump tweeted in march. as for heidi's "beans," trump never spilled them, much less described what he was referring to. 'a sniveling coward' cruz's irate response was predictable -- even if his choice of words was not. "donald, you're a sniveling coward and leave heidi the hell alone," cruz told reporters in wisconsin, pointing his finger at the cameras for emphasis. trump links cruz's father to lee harvey oswald heidi was not the only cruz family member to be called out by trump. "(ted cruz's) father, you know, was with lee harvey oswald prior to oswald's, you know, being shot. i mean the whole thing is ridiculous," trump said in an interview on "fox and friends" the day of the indiana primary in may. "i mean what was he doing with lee harvey oswald, shortly before the death? before the shooting? it's horrible." no other news outlets corroborated the claim that rafael cruz knew of the john f. kennedy assassin. 'a pathological liar' during a may press conference, cruz's attacks against trump hit a new level when he called trump a "pathological liar," "utterly amoral," "a narcissist at a level i don't this country's ever seen" and "a serial philanderer." the strong rhetoric came after the accusations trump made about cruz's father and shortly before the crucial indiana primary contest -- which cruz lost, ending his candidacy. cruz's lack of endorsement at the rnc cruz showed the hard feelings hadn't subsided two months later at the republican national convention, when he blatantly undercut trump with a lack of endorsement during his turn at the lectern. cruz personally told trump he would not be offering him an endorsement during his speech, instead encouraging voters to "vote your conscience" -- earning boos from an audience hoping for party unity. trump didn't want cruz's endorsement, anyway asked about the snub, trump said he didn't want it, anyway. "if he gives it, i will not accept it," trump said at a news conference at the end of the convention. a new canadian prime minister? in january, trump tweeted a fallback plan for cruz in case his presidential dreams fell short, suggesting cruz could be the canadian prime minister, a jab at questions over cruz's eligibility to be president due to his canadian birthplace. 'pathetic' kasich and cruz band together when cruz and ohio gov. john kasich -- a pair trump once called "the leftovers" as they were his last challengers in the primary fight -- made an attempt to divide the map to stop trump, the mogul didn't mince words about his view of the maneuver. "actually i was happy, because it shows how weak they are, it shows how pathetic they are," trump said. trump accuses cruz of stealing the iowa caucuses after cruz came out victorious during the iowa caucuses, trump accused cruz of committing fraud and stealing the win. "based on the fraud committed by senator ted cruz during the iowa caucus, either a new election should take place or cruz results nullified," trump tweeted in february. "ted cruz didn't win iowa, he stole it. that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. bad!" trump also tweeted. the accusations came after cruz sent out deceitful mailers that shared voter's caucus attendance records with their neighbors and warned them of "voter violation."       an incomplete list of the most vicious trump vs. cruz attacks      
__label__0 washington (cnn)it is a staple of donald trump's stump speech, intended to show that the country is experiencing a frightening crime wave. "last year we saw a 17% increase in violent crime in our 50 largest cities," he often says. trump used to say that it was a 17% increase in homicides in the country's 50 largest cities. he now says that increase is in "violent crimes." since trump does not say what he considers violent crimes, it is difficult to check his figures. a yearly survey conducted by the major cities chiefs association showed that homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault and non-fatal shootings increased by about 2% in 65 major jurisdictions. (the chiefs' association list includes large counties such as los angeles county and prince georges county, maryland -- outside washington -- as well as cities such as pittsburgh, newark, new jersey, and cincinnati that are not among the nation's 50 largest.) but if trump's claim is that the number of homicides in 2015 was 17% larger than the number of murders in 2014, he is closer to the mark. the major chiefs association survey showed that murders did increase by nearly 16% among its members. and a survey of the country's 30 largest cities done by new york university's brennan center for justice indicated an increase in homicides of 14%. but these numbers do not represent an across-the-board increase in homicides for major jurisdictions, nor that an unprecedented wave of killings is hitting virtually all big cities. in fact, only three cities -- baltimore, chicago and washington -- account for more than half of the national increase in murders, according to the brennan center survey. if you take those three cities out of the equation, the number of murders only jumped by about 7% in the nation's largest cities. "i think trump's figure is more misleading than inaccurate," said inimai m. chettiar, the director of the justice program at the brennan center. verdict: true, but misleading.       reality check: trump misleads when it comes to rising crime rates      
__label__0 washington (cnn)the fbi released friday nearly 200 pages of notes from its investigation of hillary clinton's private email server, just three days before she squares off against donald trump in the first presidential debate. the notes, taken from interviews of top clinton aides, supporters and others, include details of how a close clinton confidant explained how the state department made sure the white house system would not bounce back the emails from the then-secretary of state. but the documents -- a summary of which had already been released in the overall fbi report -- provide little in the way of major bombshells. politically, however, friday's release helps keep the issue relevant before the debate. the release also comes hours after news that top clinton aide cheryl mills had obtained a limited immunity deal from the fbi in order to cooperate with its investigation. in one exchange, an unidentified interviewee details alleged efforts by a top state department official, patrick kennedy, to argue during the release of the clinton emails for classifications that would protect her. but kennedy, in his own interview, denied the charge. top clinton aide huma abedin, in her interview, explained how they had to update email addresses with the white house so clinton could email president barack obama because the president could only receive emails from approved addresses. if her email was not on an approved list, which was managed by the president's staff, the white house server would reject it. when abedin was shown a 2012 email exchange, she did not recognize the pseudonym -- when agents explained it was obama, she replied, "how is this not classified?" there is no evidence obama knew that clinton was using a private email server at the time. he has said he only found out about her use of it when it became public. many of those who communicated with clinton have told the fbi they didn't realize she was using a private server, and often one may not realize what email address is behind a name unless one clicks on it. agents also interviewed "guccifer" -- the hacker who targeted the bush family -- who detailed his successful infiltration of close clinton friend sidney blumenthal's email account and reviewed 30,000 emails and downloaded 25 attachments. guccifer also detailed taking a screenshot of one blumenthal exchange regarding the benghazi attacks. fbi releases hillary clinton email report in other interviews released friday evening, clinton aides seemed generally unconcerned about her use of a private email server and said she adhered to standard security measures -- arguments they have made extensively in public. but one it worker took a somewhat cavalier attitude, joking in one interview that a new 60-day retention policy was a "hillary coverup operation" -- which sparked the trump campaign's anger. "the fact an it staffer maintaining clinton's secret server called a new retention policy designed to delete emails after 60 days a 'hillary coverup operation' suggests there was a concerted effort to systematically destroy potentially incriminating information," trump spokesman jason miller said in a statement. "it's no wonder that at least five individuals tied to the email scandal, including clinton's top state department aide and attorney cheryl mills, secured immunity deals from the obama justice department to avoid prosecution." the latest revelations in the clinton email scandal are certain to play a central role in trump's line of attack monday, when the two meet for their first presidential debate in new york. trump has built his "crooked hillary" line of insults off arguments stemming from her emails. the additional notes were released three weeks after the fbi released its report from its investigation of clinton and her emails, as well as the notes from clinton's own high-profile interview with federal agents. clinton, in her interview, said she did not know about key records retention policies and whether she was violating rules. but on the trail, her campaign and supporters have routinely said she did not break any laws with her email handling. no criminal charges fbi director james comey in july took the unprecedented step of announcing in a press conference the fbi's conclusion that there was not enough evidence to merit a criminal prosecution, before handing over his findings to the justice department. the doj followed that recommendation and decided no prosecution was merited. after comey testified about the decision before congress, members requested access to his agency's report. last month, the bureau gave members of congress access to the notes, as well as notes from interviews with other clinton staff and aides, but kept that version of the report classified. comey testified that no transcript of the interview exists, only the notes taken on it. clinton was not under oath. cnn's laura koran, evan perez, adam levine, mary kay mallonee, ross levitt, ryan browne, tal kopan, pamela brown, daniella diaz and kevin liptak contributed to this report.      fbi releases notes from clinton email investigation      
__label__0 washingtonsince we last updated the cnn battleground map, donald trump has clearly improved his poll numbers both in some national polls and in some critical battleground states. the republican nominee has also upped his game (as have his allied outside group friends) with television ad spending.  and, yet, hillary clinton maintains her advantage on the road to 270 when it comes to piecing together the electoral math needed to win the presidency. why two congressional districts could be key to this election with four days to go before the highly anticipated first presidential debate and just under 7 weeks before all the votes are cast, hillary clinton still sits above that key threshold in the latest cnn outlook. when you add up all the states either solidly or currently leaning clinton's way, she has 272 electoral votes in her column in our new estimate. what's changed? -- iowa (6) moves from from "battleground" to "lean republican" -- utah (6) moves from "lean republican" to "solid republican" -- maine's 2nd congressional district (1) moves from "solid democrat" to "battleground" -- nebraska's 2nd congressional district (1) moves from "solid republican" to "battleground" explore the map and make your choices road to 270: electoral college map note: the split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines. the state of play donald trump has improved his standing in our electoral college outlook due to iowa (a state barack obama won twice) and its six electoral votes moving from the true toss-up "battleground" category into the "lean republican" category, giving trump a total of 196 electoral votes either solidly or leaning in his favor.  that leaves 70 electoral votes up for grabs across four states (plus two congressional districts) -- florida, nevada, ohio, and north carolina.  maine and nebraska award individual electoral votes by congressional district in addition to the multiple electoral votes based on statewide results. both maine and nebraska's second congressional district have moved into battleground status in this latest estimate. maine's second congressional district has moved from "solid democrat" to "battleground" and nebraska's second congressional district has moved from "solid republican" to "battleground," providing an opportunity for a candidate to pick up a single electoral vote in what otherwise might be hostile territory.  finally, utah moves back from "leaning republican" to being solidly being in trump's column.  there is no doubt that trump has improved his chances in the last several weeks and that he is extremely competitive in all of the remaining critical battleground states, but clinton's firewall is not yet showing any significant cracks and that is what makes trump's path to 270 electoral votes still quite challenging. for all of the endless talk about florida, ohio and north carolina, it is perhaps most important to keep your eye on clinton's performance in the states that are leaning her way, but not solidly in her camp. pennsylvania, colorado, michigan, and virginia are the core of clinton's current stronger and more viable path to 270. if trump begins to find significant inroads to any of those blue-leaning states, that will set off some alarm bells at her brooklyn hq and suggest a more viable path for trump. it is not enough for trump to simply win the remaining 70 electoral votes in the battleground states -- that only gets him to 266. he still needs to chip away at clinton's democratic leaning firewall. ohio poised to go down to the line on election day that's why we see both trump and clinton and their surrogates returning again and again to pennsylvania, for example. and that's why clinton and pro-clinton forces spent more than $16 million on television ads in the keystone state compared to the $5.3 million we've seen from trump and pro-trump forces. in fact, pennsylvania is the state with the third-highest number of ad dollars spent this cycle, behind only florida and ohio. clinton and trump will surely continue the fully engaged battle for the votes of floridians and ohioans, but until and unless trump can put one of those democratic leaning states back on the board as a battleground or even make one lean his way, clinton's electoral college advantage holds. solid republican: alabama (9), alaska (3), arkansas (6), idaho (4), indiana (11), kansas (6), kentucky (8), louisiana (8), mississippi (6), missouri (10), montana (3), nebraska (4), north dakota (3), oklahoma (7), south carolina (9), south dakota (3), tennessee (11), texas (38), utah (6)west virginia (5), wyoming (3) (163 total) leans republican: arizona (11), georgia (16), iowa (6), (33 total) battleground states: florida (29), nevada (6), ohio (18), maine 2nd congressional district (1) nebraska 2nd congressional district (1), north carolina (15) (70 total) leans democratic: colorado (9), michigan (16), new hampshire (4), pennsylvania (20), virginia (13), wisconsin (10), (72 total) solid democratic: california (55), connecticut (7), delaware (3), dc (3), hawaii (4), illinois (20), maine (3), maryland (10), massachusetts (11), new jersey (14), new york (29), oregon (7), rhode island (4), vermont (3), washington (12), minnesota (10), new mexico (5) (200 total) will mullery and tal yellin contributed to this story.      road to 270: cnn's latest electoral college map      
__label__0 new york (cnn)there's one thing donald trump brings to the debate stage monday night: unpredictability. the republican nominee and his allies hope his unconventional style will be a huge asset when he squares off against hillary clinton -- a skilled debater in her own right. clinton, trump poised for historic debate battle but with 11 debates under his belt from the brutal republican primary season, trump has plenty of go-to moves when it comes to debating. here's what we've learned from trump's primary debate performances and what they could tell us to expect monday night: face-to-face insults trump's affinity for insults and name-calling quickly became a staple of his presidential campaign. jeb bush may forever be remembered for the "low energy" moniker the billionaire coined. but trump's name-calling on the stump before friendly crowds didn't stop when he joined his opponents on the same stage. trump repeatedly called texas sen. ted cruz a liar to his face in several of the debates, and even pulled out the "lyin' ted" moniker. poll: clinton, trump virtually tied headed into debate and when marco rubio repeatedly needled trump, the brash billionaire didn't think twice before throwing "little marco" and "lightweight" in the florida senator's face. "this guy's a choke artist and this guy's a liar," trump once said of cruz and rubio during a debate. the name-calling and insults served the dual purpose of drawing attention to the core vulnerabilities of trump's opponents, while also deflecting from whatever attack they were throwing his way. if trump sticks to this pattern, clinton should gird herself for the "crooked hillary" moniker and a volley of adjectives from "corrupt" to "criminal." there's nowhere he won't go trump has done more than just name-calling in the debates. a big reason his attacks have been so effective has been his willingness to strike where traditional politicians would hold back or take a less direct tack. after all, trump is the candidate who suggested ben carson was incurably mentally ill due to childhood anger issues and floated the conspiracy theory that cruz's father was involved in jfk's assassination. perhaps most memorably, during the march 3 debate, trump defended himself from rubio's attacks on the size of his hands -- and the implications about his manhood. "he referred to my hands, if they are small something else must be small. i guarantee you there is no problem, i guarantee," trump said. team trump: we didn't invite gennifer flowers and physical appearance wasn't beyond the pale for trump, who once threw this zinger at rand paul: "i never attacked him or his looks and believe me there's plenty of subject matter right there." trump has already thrown every scandal and conspiracy theory clinton's way. he's raised her husband's sex scandals and called her a "nasty, mean enabler." he's also revived the debunked theory that she was involved in the death of white house staffer vince foster and has suggested she's mentally and physically unfit to serve as president. trump has already hinted that there's a chance he'll cross that line, but only if clinton does first. belittles canned responses the canned zinger is a staple of presidential debates that, if done right, can leave a mark. but trump loves to slap down anything he considers to be a pre-packaged, poll-tested line. during the late february gop debate, rubio hit trump with an seemingly prepared line: "if he builds the wall the way he built trump towers he'll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it." why the debate expectations game is a farce "so cute. such a cute soundbite," trump fired back, undercutting the zing of rubio' line. clinton can expect a similar retort if she deploys the same tactic. it's part of a larger theme of trump's candidacy -- one that bemoans and belittles "all talk, no action" career politicians and makes a mockery of tired political tropes. that's not to say he won't bring any prepared materials trump hasn't brought any focus grouped zingers to his debate performances, but he has frequently recycled lines he's prone to use during rallies and in interviews. whether it's about the "third world" nature of us infrastructure or lamenting the us trade imbalance with mexico while saying their leaders are "much smarter" than those in america, trump's debate performances are laced with trump's favorite throwaway lines. but while his campaign has consistently sought to lower expectations and downplay the amount of effort the billionaire puts into debate prep, trump has also arrived prepared. 8 unforgettable presidential debate blunders after cruz attacked trump on his "new york values," trump arrived at the following debate with a well thought out and even uncharacteristically poignant rebuttal. "when the world trade center came down, i saw something that no place on earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than new york," trump said. rapid fire trump has prided himself on being a counter-puncher. he waits for his rivals to go after him and then he hits them back twice as hard. throw that into a debate context and trump's counter punching gives him a chance to show voters he's quick on his feet to dismiss rivals' attacks or deflect with one of his own. but trump's knack for returning fire is also a tactic to try and knock his rivals off kilter and make them look weak. debate commission chief: candidates should fact-check each other rather than wait for his rivals to finish their attack, trump might interject with a snide comment belittling the line or deploy one of his many facial expressions that will catch the attention of the television audience. the goal for trump is to get under his rivals' skin, poking at them to draw them into a back-and-forth -- one trump likely won't back down from. when it comes to clinton, trump's rapid-fire put downs are likely to sound a lot like the schoolyard put down, "i know you are but what am i." pressed on his biggest weaknesses by clinton, trump has frequently replied in boomerang fashion, flinging clinton's words right back at her. go after the moderator if all else fails, trump will turn to his favorite tactic of attacking the media -- in this case, the debate moderator lester holt of nbc. faced with tough questions during the primary from conservative radio host hugh hewitt and fox news anchor megyn kelly -- in two separate debates -- trump deflected with a personal attack or threat. "first of all, very few people listen to your radio show, that's the good news," trump responded when hewitt asked trump about releasing his tax returns. how lester holt is getting ready for monday's debate and when kelly asked trump during the first primary debate last august about the disparaging comments he's made about women, trump famously retorted with a warning. "i've been very nice to you, although i could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me. but i wouldn't do that," trump said. already, trump has sought to work the refs, suggesting holt would be unfair to him and arguing that moderators shouldn't play the role of fact-checkers.       donald trump's 6 debate tactics      
__label__0 washington (cnn)most white working-class voters who are evangelical christians -- like most white evangelicals -- would consider voting for donald trump. but it's not because they believe he shares their conservative christian values. rather, they agree with him that america is not as great as it once was, according to a new cnn/kaiser family foundation poll. while black evangelicals are solidly against the gop nominee, among white working-class evangelicals, about three in four -- 76% -- say they'd consider voting for trump. partisanship likely plays a big part in this, as half of white working-class evangelical christians identify as republicans. the majority -- 6 in 10 -- of voters in this group believe the us' better days are in the past and most are concerned that the country is becoming less christian. nearly 90% of working class whites who are evangelical christians believe christian values are under attack in america today. while most christian groups -- 73% of mainline protestants and 61% of catholics -- share this view, only 41% of those with no religious preference believe these values are under attack. trump often says he wants to "make america great again," and working-class whites are a core of his support, but that doesn't mean they don't question the faith of a man who once said he never asks god for forgiveness. "when listening to him, he's not a christian. he does not have any of the values that we have," said buddy mitchell, a 47-year-old from arvada, colorado, and owner of a flooring company. "i don't know of any redeeming quality of donald trump other than both democrats and republicans hate him," said mitchell, who did not participate in the survey. "that's the only reason i like him: that the establishment doesn't like him." christian values seen as under attack that dislike for the establishment is a strong point for trump with this demographic. for many white working-class evangelicals, it's clear who is at fault for many of the country's issues: the federal government. white working-class evangelicals are also more likely than others to blame the federal government for the economic problems facing the working class. "i don't think that either candidate is taking christian values into consideration," said sandra long, an 80-year-old lifelong democrat. "neither one of them is acting very christian-like. just a lot of things are said and done. it scares me." long, a mahanoy city, pennsylvania, resident, is scared that society is becoming more secular and will be a less accepting place for people with more conservative christian values. "i feel the country was founded on christian principles. they came here to get away form being persecuted for their beliefs," she said. "and now, if our ministers don't marry a gay couple or refuse to marry a gay couple, they can be arrested and taken to jail." while same-sex marriage is legal, religious leaders are not required to marry gay couples. darrell pool, a 60-year-old from lamar, colorado, said he doesn't see his traditional christian values honored by the leading candidates. "i don't see my values shaping the election. there's just a lot of mayhem," he said. "i think the values that were in the country's founding are leaving. the moral values are leaving daily." many white working-class evangelicals have no confidence that either of the presidential candidates has the ability to return the country to their perception of its former glory. "i don't know where i am," said long. "i'm so confused at this point and time. i don't believe either one of them should be in office. i don't believe either one should be running." some have entertained third-party candidates. "i'm sick to my stomach. i cannot stand hillary (clinton) and i can't stand trump, so for the first time in my life, i'm thinking of voting libertarian or not voting," mitchell said. for these voters, the lack of confidence in government is exemplified in the candidacy of clinton, who has been in government for more than 20 years. "if you or i would have done what she did with those emails, we'd be in jail," mitchell said. "but because she's the democratic nominee, they don't hold politicians to the same standards that they hold the people." many of the standards these voters want to see candidates follow are rooted in the christian faith. security also a concern but values aren't the only concerns of these voters. national security is also a major issue to many of these voters, many of whom have personal connections to the military. "all these refugees they want to bring in, that's really got me going," said pool, who participated in the survey. "they have no idea who they're bringing in and we just keep having more attacks here." "i just think it's ludicrous and all it's for is so one party can have more voters," he said. the relationship between evangelicals and the refugee issue is a complicated one. some of the biggest critics of trump's proposed muslim ban have been evangelicals. christian organizations have been among the most active in helping resettle refugees, but that doesn't mean some among their flock aren't anxious. the majority -- 75% -- of white working-class evangelicals believe that recent immigrants from predominantly muslim countries increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the us, a higher percentage than other working-class whites. "i say let's quit bringing these people in, period," pool said. "i realize america is a melting pot and that's how america started in the first place, but we have a process here. nobody says you can't come to this country. come on in. let's do it the right way."       white working-class evangelicals: christian values are under attack      
__label__0 washington (cnn)a series of high-profile breaches and warnings from national intelligence leaders has elections directors in critical battleground states seeking federal help against possible cyberattacks. officials in pennsylvania and ohio tell cnn they are working closely with the department of homeland security to protect their elections systems from cyberattacks and breaches. ohio is going one step further. "we even asked the national guard to attempt to penetrate our databases," said joshua eck, a spokesman for ohio secretary of state jon husted. "we've had a number of really positive tests. it has gone well and we've been able to find vulnerabilities and fix them." a pair of cyberattacks on illinois' and arizona's voter registration databases over the summer spurred the obama administration to ring the alarm bells for states as they prepare for what has already been a chaotic campaign. and top democrats on the house and senate intelligence committees publicly accused the russian government of seeking to alter the election. "based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the u.s. election," sen. dianne feinstein and rep. adam schiff, of california, said thursday. russian intelligence agencies behind us election hacks, lawmakers say cybersecurity experts say the prospect of "rigging" the election, and changing the outcome, is practically impossible. elections are decentralized: 50 states, plus the district of columbia, run their own operations, not to mention the thousands of counties across the country that play a major role at the local level. different jurisdictions use different voting machines, it isn't plausible for hackers to breach them all in one fell swoop -- penetrating one election system in north carolina has no impact on colorado. furthermore, most voting machines aren't connected to the internet, which inoculates them from outside intrusions. but hackers could still cause plenty of havoc in november, with attacks on registration systems or government websites reporting the results on election night. many news organizations pull their results from those sites. "think about the chaos you could cause if you get one tv network calling the election for one candidate, and another network calling the election for the other," said professor herbert lin, a cybersecurity expert at stanford university. "if your intent is to sow doubt and uncertainty, at least in the short term, affecting the media reporting could be really problematic." dhs running 'cyber hygiene scans' homeland security secretary jeh johnson is the obama administration's point man on election security, holding meetings with elections officials from across the country, and offering help to states that are interested. dhs is offering "cyber hygiene scans" that will remotely search for vulnerabilities in election systems like online voter registration systems and election night reporting infrastructure. it is also offering to send cybersecurity experts to states so they can conduct more aggressive in-person testing the final weeks of the campaign. johnson recently laid out other federal resources for states in a memo last week, including a 24/7 center to respond to cyberattacks, and a list of "best practices" on how to secure voter registration databases. pennsylvania has accepted the dhs help, both the remote scans and the in-person testing, said pennsylvania department of state spokeswoman wanda murren. election authorities in ohio are also accepting federal help. but not every state is happy to have the administration involved. georgia's secretary of state publicly scoffed at these efforts and accused the federal government of trying to "subvert the constitution." georgia secretary of state brian kemp, a republican, rebuffed the idea, telling nextgov that the feds might want to "subvert the constitution to achieve the goal of federalizing elections under the guise of security." however, his office later walked back the comment, saying they were not flatly refusing the assistance. a call for comment from kemp was not immediately returned thursday. florida officials, whose recount debacle in 2000 led to the federal law which ultimately created voter registration databases, declined to say whether they were accepting help from dhs, citing security concerns. what are the threats? perhaps the most serious vulnerability is the integrity of voter registration systems. hackers can break in and delete or alter individual voter registration records, creating confusion on election day when voters show up to their polling place and their names are mysteriously missing from the rolls, or their address is changed. this summer, hackers broke into a stash of information for about 90,000 voters in illinois, breaching a database with voters' names, addresses, sex and birthdays. and officials in arizona took their voter registration system offline after they learned that a russian hacker had breached their systems. once hackers penetrate a voter registration system, "the scope could be whatever they want," said cathie brown, who served as virginia's deputy chief information security officer and is a cybersecurity expert with impact makers. "deleting an entire precinct of voters -- that's absolutely possible. the grander the scope, the more likely they'll get caught. but they might not get caught until after they've done the damage." but at least one expert said that state elections directors have been dealing with technological threats for a long time. "the state and local election officials, this whole notion of security is not new to them this is something they deal with all the time," said tim mattice, executive director of the elections center, which trains state and local elections officials on administering elections. mattice's organization works with the professional group representing election officials, the national association of state election directors. mattice said that when dhs offered up help, most people understood them when they said they were making it voluntary and did not want to be viewed as coming in and taking over state-run elections. ironically, mattice noted that the focus on technological security got serious after congress passed the national help america vote act in the wake of the 2000 elections, which mandated that states develop integrated voter registration systems -- effectively placing all the voter data in systems that could be hacked. asked how hackers got through in illinois and arizona despite the layers of security that elections officials already have in place, mattice said it's the same problem any organization or business faces. "you could ask target how they got hacked -- these hackers are getting sophisticated," mattice said.       hacking the election? feds step in as states fret cyber threats      
__label__0 (cnn)hillary clinton and donald trump are virtually tied headed into their first presidential debate monday night, a new abc news/washington post poll shows. the survey shows likely voters split 46% for clinton and 44% for trump -- with 5% supporting libertarian gary johnson and 1% backing the green party's jill stein. that's well within the poll's 4.5 percentage point margin of error. among a broader group -- registered voters -- clinton and trump are tied at 41%, with johnson at 7% and stein at 2%. the results show the race has tightened in recent weeks. in the same poll, clinton led by 5 points in early september and by 8 points in early august. a new cnn poll of polls incorporating the results of the new post-abc poll finds the margin in an average of the five most recent polls holding at a three-point edge for clinton, 43% back her, 40% trump in that calculation. there's been a similar tightening in the key swing state of pennsylvania, a new allentown morning call/muhlenberg college survey shows. that poll, released sunday, has clinton at 40% to trump's 38%, with johnson at 8% and stein at 3%. that's a drop for clinton, who led by 8 points in the same poll a week earlier. the abc news/washington post poll also underscored that the 9 p.m. et monday debate at hofstra university in new york will be a crucial moment in the campaign for both candidates. eight in 10 voters said they plan to watch the debate -- with expectations slightly higher for clinton, with 44% saying they expect her to win the debate while 34% expect trump to win. jennifer agiesta contributed to this report.      poll: clinton, trump virtually tied headed into debate      
__label__0 new york (cnn)hillary clinton and donald trump face off for the first time on the debate stage monday night, the biggest moment of the already extraordinary 2016 presidential race. with national polls showing a tight race just six weeks out from election day, the hofstra university fight offers one of the last chances for each to speak directly to the tens millions of voters who are expected to tune in. what time is the debate? for clinton, a veteran debater, one of her biggest challenges will be both to provoke trump and avoid being provoked by him, while delivering an earnest and candid performance. what should you watch for at the debate? david chalian breaks it down on "the daily dc" and for trump, who had uneven and at times explosive debate performances during the republican primary, his first one-on-one debate presents a serious test of his ability to stay on script and keep his cool. here are five things to watch at monday night's debate: which donald trump will show up? during the long republican primary, there was no telling which trump would show up to a debate. sometimes it was the combative and hostile trump -- quick to throw punches and go after his opponents with personal attacks. other times, it was an uncharacteristically subdued trump, content to disappear from the spotlight for long stretches of time and let his competitors command the stage and attack one another. "we are preparing for different trumps that might show up," clinton spokeswoman jennifer palmieri told reporters last week. "he may be aggressive or he may lay back and that's hard to game out." being overtly antagonistic toward clinton would be a risky move for trump. if he is unable to keep calm and stay focused, it will only feed the narrative that he lacks the temperament to be president and potentially make him look small next clinton, who is famous for being measured. trump also won't have the option of sitting on the sidelines. as one of only two candidates on stage, the republican nominee must make the most of every minute allotted to him and show a level of agility and rapid-response instincts that was far less critical on a debate stage with numerous candidates. monday night will pose a critical test for trump, who has so far shown a relative lack of depth on policy. with approximately half of the debate's 90 minutes dedicated to the gop nominee, it will be far more difficult than in past debates for trump to get by with sweeping statements that he is accustomed to making at rallies and in interviews, particularly given that clinton's strong suit is policy. can clinton heed obama advice to 'be yourself?' no one understands clinton's debating chops better than president barack obama, who faced off against her numerous times in the 2008 election. obama's advice to clinton for monday? "be yourself and explain what motivates you," the president told abc's robin roberts last week. "i think there's a reason why we haven't had a woman president before, and so she's having to break down some barriers. there's a level of mistrust and a caricature of her that just doesn't jibe with who i know." how hillary clinton took debate prep seriously so far in this campaign, clinton has struggled to do precisely that, and appearing unguarded and likeable -- fairly or not -- has been one of her biggest political challenges. there's no question that policy is clinton's forte -- aides to the former senator and secretary of state describe her as a wonk who knows policy inside and out. as she marshals her fluency in policy, she will want to avoid coming off as lecturing or smug, the way critics say al gore did in his debates with george w. bush. but appearing next to trump could help make clinton more likable by comparison: polls show that a majority of voters question trump's temperament and view him as appealing to bigotry. the clinton campaign says it plans to drive home the point that trump habitually makes factually inaccurate statements. "donald trump has pattern of repeating lies hoping no one will correct him," palmieri, clinton's communications director, said on a call with reporters last week. "this warrants particular focus because his level of lying is unprecedented in american politics." clinton has acknowledged that she doesn't have the natural charisma of obama or her husband, bill clinton, but she has fleshed out her personal story and offered a sharper positive message in recent weeks, and she will likely attempt to continue that effort on monday. things could get really personal the 2016 election has already showcased a whole lot of nasty name-calling, but monday night has the potential to descend into the worst mudfight yet. even before the debate had begun, the two campaigns were in full trolling mode. the clinton campaign offered mark cuban -- the tv celebrity billionaire who recently endorsed the democratic nominee -- a front row seat at hofstra. cuban has been relentless in attacking trump-- in july, he said trump "went off the reservation and went bats -- crazy" -- and he has also called out trump for not releasing his tax returns. having cuban in the front row is the kind of mind game that the clinton camp hopes will distract and throw trump off his game. but in trumpian fashion, the gop nominee responded over the weekend by threatening to bring gennifer flowers as his guest to the debate. flowers is a former arkansas state employee who claimed to have had a multi-year sexual relationship with bill clinton. the former president has admitted to having a sexual encounter with her. the trump campaign later said it won't invite flowers to the debate. still, trump's comments may foreshadow his willingness to dredge up some of the most painful incidents from the clintons' past, including bill clinton's various indiscretions. hillary clinton, too, could go there if provoked -- trump has been married three times and has two messy divorces under his belt; has openly boasted in the past about his playboy lifestyle. moreover his offensive remarks about women and minorities are part of her campaign's argument he is temperamentally unfit to be president. asked by cnn on her plane earlier this month whether she believes it is fair game to go after trump's personal life, clinton didn't rule out the possibility. trump, meanwhile, said on fox news last week: "if she treats me with respect, i will treat her with respect." the politics of race there's no shortage of top-tier issues -- terrorism, syria, isis, immigration, the economy among them -- but the first general election match-up comes amid national outrage sparked yet again by police killings of african-american men. the recent deaths of keith lamont scott in north carolina and terence crutcher in oklahoma have sparked fresh and impassioned calls for justice and protests that have at times turned violent. with the issue of police force -- particularly toward minorities -- dominating headlines, the politics of race is guaranteed to be a discussion topic. race and racism in 2016 both clinton and trump had planned to visit charlotte -- where scott was killed -- around the debate: clinton on sunday and trump on monday. but both campaigns scrapped those plans after charlotte mayor jennifer roberts told cnn's erin burnett that the city was too stretched on resources. for both clinton and trump, the challenge will be to offer detailed proposals on how they would address unnecessary police violence and thoughtfully speak to a grieving community. it also gives both a chance to make arguments to key constituencies -- clinton to african-americans who voted with obama, and trump to gop base voters with his "law and order" pitch. the debate will likely delve into many other policy issues including healthcare, trade, economy and foreign policy. but many of the core disagreements between trump and clinton are rooted in the different ways in which they view race and inclusion. the two nominees have starkly contrasting views on immigration, for example, and how to handle people who enter the country illegally. they also clash on the national security front — particularly on how they want to combat terrorism. clinton has urged measured responses that ensure that an entire religion is not villanized -- trump, meanwhile, has suggested using methods of racial profiling and keeping out entire ethnic groups as a safety measure. all eyes on lester holt no one who will face more pressure monday night than hillary clinton and donald trump -- except lester holt. the nbc "nightly news" anchor and veteran newscaster is about to enter uncharted territory as the moderator of the first clinton-trump face-off. monday will mark holt's first time presiding over a general election presidential debate; some 70 to 100 million people are expected to tune in; and there is no telling what dynamics will drive ultimately drive the prime-time event. how lester holt is getting ready for monday's debate both campaigns have preemptively cranked up the heat, suggesting that holt and the other moderators might be less than fair to their respective candidates. palmieri told reporters last week that her biggest concern heading into the debate is that trump and clinton will be graded on different curves. "you should be held to the same standard on knowledge, what kind of plans you have, your ability to explain your plans," she said. "our concern is just what kind of standard is he held to." trump, meanwhile, has suggested that holt is a democrat. "lester is a democrat. i mean, they are all democrats. ok? it's a very unfair system," trump said. (holt is actually a registered republican.) what holt wants to avoid at all costs is the fate that recently befell his nbc colleague matt lauer. the "today" show host moderated the network's "commander-in-chief forum" earlier this moth, and the reviews were disastrous. lauer was accused of multiple transgressions, including aggressively interrupting clinton, spending too much time grilling her on the email controversy, asking trump relatively soft-ball questions and failing to call him out when he falsely stated that he had opposed the iraq war. with regard to fact-checking, "lester is not going to be a potted plant," one nbc staffer close to holt said.       5 things to watch at monday night's clinton-trump debate      
__label__0 (cnn)hillary clinton forced donald trump onto defense over his temperament, refusal to release his taxes and his past comments about race and women during a fiery debut presidential debate monday -- a potentially pivotal moment in a tight election campaign. clinton, who has seen her dominance of the presidential race fade in the weeks since the democratic convention, delivered a strong performance in which she demonstrated a command of policy and a sense of humor, smiling through some of trump's strongest attacks. she delivered the best zinger of the night in response to criticism from trump for staying off the campaign trail recently. "i think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate," she said. "and yes, i did. and you know what else i prepared for? i prepared to be president. and that is a good thing." trump came out swinging at the beginning of the debate, and made some effective points on the economy and jobs -- some of the aspects of his outsider presidential campaign that have struck a chord with many americans. but the debate highlighted trump's tendency to make false claims as he made inaccurate statements on everything from laws regarding policing, his support for the iraq war and his contention that clinton was behind the so-called birther conspiracy. cnn's reality check team vets the claims at the first debate appearing in the "spin room" after the debate to talk to journalists, trump said he was happy with his performance. "it went better than i ever thought," he told cnn's dana bash. a cnn/orc poll of debate watchers released after the event found 62% felt clinton won compared to 27% for trump. the poll suggests the debate audience was a bit more democratic than the public as a whole, about on par with the democratic tilt in the audience that watched the first debate in 2008 between obama and john mccain. one of the most powerful moments of the debate came when the conversation focused on the so-called birther debate following trump's recent acknowledgment that president barack obama was born in the us -- a fact that has been evident for years. with trump standing just a few feet from her, clinton blasted him for perpetuating a "racist lie." "he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior," clinton said as trump shook his head. trump hit back, noting clinton's tough critiques of obama during their bitter 2008 primary battle. 'holier than thou' "you treated him with terrible disrespect and i watch the way you talk now about how lovely everything is ... it doesn't work that way," he said. "when you try to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work." as the debate ended, clinton hammered trump over his treatment of women. "this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs," clinton said. she accused trump of calling a latina contestant in a beauty contest "miss piggy" and a housekeeper because of her ethnicity, seemingly throwing trump off as he twice asked "where did you find this?" who is alicia machado? former miss universe said trump called her miss piggy clinton repeatedly sought to correct trump's statements -- going so far as referring viewers to fact checks on her website -- as she aimed to portray him as out of touch with the complexities of the american economy. "i know you live in your own reality," she told trump. clinton and trump opened the debate on a positive note by shaking hands before stationing themselves behind their podiums at hofstra university on new york's long island. their spouses, former president bill clinton and melania trump, also greeted each other before taking their seats in the debate hall. from there, the drama quickly unfolded. an increasingly angry trump slammed clinton for putting her plans to fight isis on her website -- and thereby tipping off america's enemy. "well, at least i have a plan to fight isis," clinton responded, referring to his previous statements that he has a "secret" plan to destroy the terrorist group. battling over taxes clinton also hit trump over his refusal to release his tax returns. "why won't he release his tax returns?" clinton asked. "maybe he is not as rich as he says he is," she went on. "maybe he is not as charitable as he claims to be," "maybe he doesn't want the american people to know that he has paid nothing in federal taxes." clinton pressed trump on the issue, saying "there is something he is hiding." trump replied that he would release his taxes when clinton made public 33,000 emails that were deleted from her private email server. when clinton said that trump had paid no federal income tax in some years, trump replied "that makes me smart." clinton also set about trump's business record, pointing out that he had called himself "the king of debt" and accusing him of "stiffing" thousand of contractors who did work for his business. when the debate turned to racial issues and crime, clinton said that it was important for police to work together with local communities to restore trust. trump accused clinton of refusing to say the phrase "law and order" and bemoaned the state of inner cities. he said that african-americans and hispanics were "living in hell." "you walk down the street, you get shot," trump said. clinton rebuked trump for painting "such a dire picture" of black communities. campaign at a critical point trump and clinton are facing off with the campaign at a critical point, as the race is a dead heat just 43 days before election day. a cnn/orc poll released monday found trump edging clinton 42% to 41% in the crucial battleground state of colorado among likely voters in a four-way race. in pennsylvania, another key state, the poll found clinton in a virtual tie against trump among likely voters at 45% to 44%. the former secretary of state is relying on both states to help pave her way to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the white house. nationally, cnn's poll of polls finds clinton and trump neck-and-neck 44%-42%. debate prep the rivals spent the day preparing for their big battle. clinton participated in mock debates with her tart-tongued former aide philippe reines playing trump. in one practice debate, reines assumed the character of the unpredictable nominee by praising clinton for her role as a pioneer for women, campaign sources said. reines even wore the kind of signature red tie that trump favors and adopted his characteristic hand gestures in a bid to fully prepare clinton for her unpredictable foe. the republican nominee has watched videos of clinton, but his preparation has been less intense than his opponent's, in keeping with his more freewheeling style. he did not hold mock debates, for instance, with someone standing in for clinton. cnn's dana bash, dylan byers and sara murray contributed to this report      clinton puts trump on defense at first debate      
__label__0 (cnn)just one point separates hillary clinton and donald trump in two states that are critical to both candidates' chances of becoming president, according to new cnn/orc polls in pennsylvania and colorado. in colorado, likely voters break 42% for trump, 41% for clinton, 13% for libertarian gary johnson and 3% for green party candidate jill stein. pennsylvania's likely voters split 45% for clinton, 44% for trump, 6% for johnson and 3% for stein. those divides are well within each poll's 3.5-point margin of sampling error. clinton, trump poised for historic debate battle the new results in two battleground states underscore the closeness of the race and come as the candidates prepare to square off monday night in their high-stakes first debate at long island's hofstra university. in both states, sharp divisions among whites by education are evident, with white college graduates choosing clinton over trump by 11 points in pennsylvania and 16 points in colorado, while whites who do not hold four-year degrees break in trump's favor by 19 points in pennsylvania and 22 points in colorado. read full colorado results in colorado, that education gap is a bigger divide than gender or age, and is even larger than the racial gap in the state. pennsylvania's likely voters are more divided than colorado's along gender and racial lines. johnson's appeal among younger voters appears to be working to clinton's detriment in both states. while trump's numbers are significantly lower among voters under 45 than among older voters, clinton's are roughly the same across age groups, while johnson's support multiplies among younger voters. clinton fares better in two-way matchups in both states, topping trump 50% to 47% among likely voters in pennsylvania and 49% to 47% in colorado. though both results are within the polls' margin of sampling error, the finding suggests she could fare better in each state if third party candidate support dipped. the two polls come alongside tight national polls and neck-and-neck poll results in several other key battleground states including ohio, florida, nevada and north carolina. 8 unforgettable presidential debate blunders in both colorado and pennsylvania, the economy stands out as far and away the top voter concern. about half of registered voters in each state, and a similar share of likely voters, call the economy most important out of a list also including terrorism, illegal immigration and foreign policy. and when asked which candidate would better handle the economy, trump comes out on top in both states, though within each poll's margin of error. clinton holds broad advantages for handling foreign policy in both states, and she tops trump by 8 points on handling immigration in colorado, a state where a pew research center analysis recently estimated that about a quarter of the state's sizable latino population is foreign born. in pennsylvania, the two candidates run about even on that issue. and in the wake of terror attacks in new york and new jersey, voters in both states are about evenly split on who would better handle terrorism. read full pennsylvania results the poll suggests clinton has made an effective case that trump does not have the temperament to be president -- she is viewed as better suited for the presidency by a nearly two-to-one margin in each state on that score -- and she holds smaller advantages as the better candidate to be commander-in-chief. but clinton continues to lag behind trump when voters are asked which of the two is more honest and trustworthy. trump's contention that clinton lacks the stamina for the job splits voters in colorado, 48% see him as having the better stamina, 45% choose clinton. in pennsylvania, trump holds a larger advantage on that, 50% to 45%. democrats have a narrow edge in the race for pennsylvania's u.s. senate seat, with katie mcginty topping incumbent pat toomey 49% to 46% among likely voters, just inside the poll's margin of error, and a broad lead in colorado's senate contest, with incumbent michael bennet up 53% to 43% over republican challenger darryl glenn. the cnn/orc polls in colorado and pennsylvania were conducted by telephone sept. 20-25. the colorado poll included interviews with 1,010 adult residents of the state, including 784 who are likely to vote in november. in pennsylvania, interviews were conducted with 1,032 adult residents of the state, including 771 likely voters. results for likely voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points in each state.       cnn/orc polls: trump, clinton deadlocked in colorado, pennsylvania

__label__0 (cnn)debate stages have long doubled as presidential burial grounds. with a few sharp lines, an acid quip, or just a well-timed nod, the candidates can do more to unravel their opponents than in a hundred speeches or television commercials. donald trump and hillary clinton have made no secret of their disdain for each another. but on monday night, there will be no safety net and nowhere to hide -- just two people on stage and, as some analysts believe, 100 million more watching their every move. clinton, trump poised for historic debate battle here are some of the most devastating lines in presidential debate history -- will trump or clinton need to be added to this list? reagan rolls carter the incumbent president jimmy carter wanted to talk about ronald reagan's work as governor of california. but reagan had heard enough -- and bet that voters felt the same way. as carter finished a long point with a comment on his opponent's "typical" positions, reagan stepped in with four words: "there you go again." obama mocks mitt mitt romney had been hammering president barack obama for having downsized parts of the armed forces. but obama turned it around on his 2012 challenger, mocking and painting him as out of touch with modern foreign policy questions. when romney trounced obama on the question of the smaller number of naval ships, obama said: "well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. we have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. we have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines." a killer joke in 1984, reagan sent republicans into a panic with a garbled opening debate performance against walter mondale. 8 unforgettable presidential debate blunders the baltimore sun's henry trewhitt asked if the president's age would keep him from being able to do the job. here is reagan's cheeky response, which mondale would later describe as having effectively ended the race: "not at all. and, mr. trewhitt, i want you to know also i will not make age an issue of this campaign. i am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience." lloyd bentsen knew jack kennedy, then he owned dan quayle you can see it about 15 seconds into the clip. vice presidential candidate sen. lloyd bentsen's brow shoots up as dan quayle, george h.w. bush's 1988 running mate, answers a question about his relative inexperience, saying, "i have as much experience in the congress as jack kennedy did when he sought the presidency." bentsen fired back: "senator, i served with jack kennedy. i knew jack kennedy. jack kennedy was a friend of mine. senator, you're no jack kennedy." mondale buries the "hatchet man" before he was a warmly remembered war hero who lost his own presidential race in a 1996 landslide to bill clinton, bob dole had a different kind of notoriety. during a 1976 vice presidential debate with walter mondale, he showed why. asked if watergate, and then president gerald ford's pardon of richard nixon, were off-limits, dole launched into a long rant essentially blaming "democrat wars" for killing millions of americans. mondale hit back with one line: "i think sen. dole has richly earned his reputation as a hatchet man tonight." perot sets himself apart with his texas twang, ross perot made a serious dent in the 1992 presidential race. here he underlines why his lack of experience in government was going to be a political asset: "i don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. i don't have any experience in gridlock government, where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. i don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent crime-ridden society in the industrialized world. but i do have a lot of experience in getting things done." lincoln prints and publishes his debate zingers though the words were spoken during one of their celebrated 1858 senate debates, abraham lincoln was so pleased with his performance against stephen a. douglas, he took the transcripts (which he edited, liberally, on his own) and published them in a book before their 1860 presidential rematch. in arguing that douglas was using a flimsy principle as a bogus pretext for spreading slavery nationwide, lincoln mockingly asked what remained of the substance of his rival's position: "has it not got down as thin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death?" gore questions (the first) bush's resume al gore was running for vice president in 1992, but that didn't mean he wasn't aiming high. here is the shot he took at george h.w. bush, who had sought to attach his record to that of his former boss reagan, during a three-way debate with dan quayle and adm. james stockdale: "george bush taking credit for the berlin wall coming down is like the rooster taking credit for the sunrise." bush shakes off gore sometimes, words are unnecessary. at 11:58 in this clip, early on in his debate with al gore, george w. bush responds to the vice president's ill-timed stroll and apparent attempt to intimidate him with a simple -- but devastating -- silent shake of his head.       fight nights past: best debate knockout lines      
__label__0 rye brook, new york (cnn)hillary clinton might be viewed as the favorite going into monday's presidential debate. but she certainly didn't prepare like one. clinton, a candidate known for being a homebody, was for most of the three nights leading up to monday's debate working at a hotel a few miles from her chappaqua, new york home, hunkered down with aides in a nondescript conference center surrounded by wedding parties and high school reunion goers. clinton spent friday, saturday and sunday night at the doral arrowwood, returning home past 11 p.m. every night after sessions with a tight group of aides and advisers. the late night sessions appeared to mimic the timing of monday's debate at hofstra university, which will run 90 minutes and start at 9 p.m. clinton's prep was not limited to late at night, however. on saturday and sunday, clinton visited the hotel twice a day: once at night and again for a few hours in the afternoon. related: clinton, trump poised for historic debate battle the frequency and timing of the sessions -- hours before clinton meets donald trump -- are an acknowledgment that the former secretary of state took her debate preparations seriously, investing four days of would-be campaigning to find a way to do what no republican candidate could: defeat trump. the sessions also mimic clinton, a candidate who aides refer to as a worrier. "like a lot of women, i have a tendency to over prepare," clinton said at greensboro, north carolina event earlier this month. "i sweat the details." trump, on the other hand, has said that he doesn't want to over-prepare for monday's debate. while he met with top advisers on sunday to hash out debate strategy, the republican nominee has largely eschewed with traditional debate prep, deciding instead to trust his instincts on monday night. jason miller, trump's spokesman, mocked clinton's two-a-day preparation on monday morning. "that might be something to brag about when you are getting ready to high school football but i am not sure heading into arguably the biggest presidential debate that our country has ever seen that that is something that you want to be putting out there," miller said. the doral arrowwood, a 337-room hotel better known locally as an event space and golf course, is an odd scene for such preparations: as clinton worked with aides, the hotel was busy hosting a high school reunion, a wedding and a meeting of pharmaceutical employees. clinton entered and exited the hotel through a back entrance and her van positioned so that she did not have to walk through the lobby to get to the conference center hosting her prep. hotel guests were however aware of clinton's presence and her secret service protected van was parked near the main entrance of the hotel. aides worry that expectations for clinton's performance might be impossibly high, given the fact that monday's contest will be over her 40 televised debate, including contests during her 2008 presidential run and her senate run in 2000. related: 5 things to watch at monday night's clinton-trump debate blatantly playing the expectations game, aides have publicly looked to muddy the view that clinton should dominate on monday by touting trump's reality show personality and showman qualities. their argument: debates are about theater more than substance, and on that measure trump has more experience. "for all his lack of substance, trump's showmanship, as ex-reality tv star, makes him a formidable debate foe. he thrashed his rivals in gop debates," brian fallon, clinton's national press secretary, tweeted in august. to try to compensate -- and knock trump off his game -- people advising clinton have been looking for one-line retorts that could become memorable moments from the contest. the all-day sessions are being led by ron klain, who advised president barack obama, and karen dunn, a longtime lawyer and aide. related: donald trump's 6 debate tactics clinton was joined in the sessions by huma abedin, her longtime aide; john podesta, her campaign chairman; and jake sullivan, clinton's top policy aide, according to the sources. philippe reines, a longtime adviser known for his combative style and fierce loyalty to clinton, is playing trump in debate prep. reines has spent more time playing "presidential trump" than "bombastic trump," according to a source with knowledge of the prep. reines, in an effort to prepare clinton for a more polished trump, has even ad lib an opening statement heralding the milestone of clinton becoming the first woman nominee of a major presidential party, the source says. what donald trump shows up has been a key concern for clinton's top aides, including that small group of advisers who have been inside her debate prep. according to the source, the aides expect trump to be a more polished, reserved candidate than the boisterous and off-the-cuff candidate that has been seen across the country on the campaign's trail. the source says clinton has done some prep with "bombastic trump," but more have been with a more reserved candidate. earlier in the process, clinton spent hours watching a highlight reel of trump's republican primary debates, according to several people familiar with her debate preparation. she took notes on what agitated him and studied his positions with the hopes of getting under his skin with her familiarity. clinton has told friends and supporters that her biggest concern is not knowing which donald trump will show up on monday night: a more moderate, controlled republican nominee or the more blunt and combative candidate? "i do not know which donald trump will show up," clinton said at an august fundraiser in new york. "maybe he will try to be presidential and try to convey a gravity that he hasn't done before or will he come in and try to insult and try to score some points." related: cnn/orc polls: trump, clinton deadlocked in colorado, pennsylvania cnn's dana bash contributed to this report.      how hillary clinton took debate prep seriously      
__label__0 (cnn)presidential debates are about ideas, tough questions -- and gaffes. the impact of one line zingers can fade after the moment, but gaffes can linger, altering a race and shifting the momentum. mistakes happen in almost every debate. and as hillary clinton and donald trump meet for their first clash monday -- 56 years to the date after the famous showdown between richard nixon and john f. kennedy -- viewers will be on alert for any stumbles that might seal the fate of either candidate. here are eight of the biggest blunders from nearly six decades of presidential debates: nixon vs. kennedy, 1960 the first televised general election debate featured a candidate who understood the power of television and one who didn't. john f. kennedy, tall, young and confident, looked into the camera and addressed 80 million viewers. richard nixon, pale and recovering from the flu, shifted his eyes, looking unfocused as he addressed the questioners rather than the viewers. nixon was also sweaty and unshaven. people who listened to the debate on the radio thought nixon won. people who watched the debate thought kennedy won. the next day's chicago daily news headline summed up the importance of the visuals: "was nixon sabotaged by tv makeup artists?" donald trump's 6 debate tactics it went so badly for nixon that for the next 16 years, general election candidates avoided televised debates. ford vs. carter, 1976 so memorable was president gerald ford's gaffe that it made it into his obituary. asked about the expansion of russian power in eastern europe, ford flatly denied it. "there is no soviet domination of eastern europe, and there never will be under a ford administration," he said. flummoxed, the moderator gave ford a chance to modify his response. but ford stuck by his response throughout the debate, insisting that poland, yugoslavia, and romania were all "independent and autonomous." sometimes thought of as "the accidental president," ford's bumbling response only highlighted the sense among some that he wasn't quite right for the job. dukakis vs. bush, 1988 the question wasn't hard. "governor," cnn's bernard shaw asked, "if kitty dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?" it was an easy opportunity for michael dukakis, the democratic governor of massachusetts, to sound human. but he whiffed and discussed his ironclad opposition to the death penalty. he talked about how massachusetts had the lowest murder rate in the country. and he criticized then-vice president george h.w. bush over his drug war policies. poll: clinton, trump virtually tied headed into debate what he didn't do in his two-minute response is talk about this wife, kitty. the next day, kitty dukakis called the question shocking and inappropriate. dukakis later admitted that he made a mistake by answering such a raw question so clinically. bush vs. clinton vs. perot, 1992 just as an audience member stood up to ask president george h.w. bush about how the national debt had personally affected him, he checked his watch. and in that moment, he provided bill clinton an opening. he also gave viewers of the first presidential town hall the impression that he just didn't care and that he had better things to do with his time. the arkansas governor pounced, showing his rare gift of connecting with voters by approaching the questioner and painting a picture of a wrecked economy where her friends and neighbors had lost jobs. the debate echoed a new york times headline months earlier that suggested he was out of touch with average voters—"bush encounters the supermarket, amazed." bush later said that in the moment he was thinking: "i hate these debates. i'm so glad it's almost over." bush vs. gore, 2000 vice president al gore just couldn't hide his exasperation. especially not after republican operatives spliced together a clip of him sighing and sighing again and again during his first presidential debate against george w. bush. after the sighing reel was circulated, the entire narrative of the first debate changed. the post-debate spin effectively turned a debate night victory into a loss for gore in the days that followed. columnists mocked him. and pundits had a talking point. on the "today" show, katie couric asked him if his sighing was "presidential behavior." why the debate expectations game is a farce in 2007 gore looked back and said: "the sighs, the sighs, the sighs. within 18 hours, they had turned perception around to where the entire story was about me sighing. and that's scary. that's scary." rick perry vs. his memory, 2011 "oops" is never a word that announces something good. for then-texas gov. rick perry, it announced the beginning of the the end of his bid for the 2012 gop nomination. in the moment, he started off pretty strong and specific. "i will tell you. it's three agencies of government when i get there that are gone," he said, staring at then-congressman ron paul, who was standing next to him. "commerce, education, and the...uh...what's the third one there?" finally, he just gave up, after the moderator pinned him down. "let's see...i can't, the third one, sorry," he said. "oops." (he later remembered that it was the department of energy). the rap on perry was that he wasn't up to the job and the "oops" moment underscored it. there was no cleaning this one up. barack obama vs. mitt romney, 2012 in his closing statement for one of the most watched debates in television history, president barack obama said it "was a terrific debate." he was right -- for mitt romney. some 70 million people watched a flat-footed and lethargic obama get hammered by a well-prepped and aggressive mitt romney. obama spoke in run-on sentences. romney spoke in bullet points. a cnn insta-poll of registered voters showed that 67% of registered voters who watched the debate thought romney won, and just 25% went with obama. even obama's campaign aide, stephanie cutter, conceded on cnn that romney "scored some points on style." how lester holt is getting ready for monday's debate yes, like every available style point. the republican national committee released a video ad called "smirk" that showed a split-screen of romney smoothly ripping obama, while the president nodded and smirked. obama's poor performance jolted the race, giving romney the momentum. at least until the second debate. marco rubio vs. chris christie, 2016 four. that's how many times sen. marco rubio pivoted to the exact same soundbite attack on president obama. four times -- in five minutes. dogged by criticisms that he was an inexperienced first-term senator who could deliver a speech but not much else, rubio provided just the evidence his critics needed. it also likely destroyed any chances he had at a good showing in the new hampshire primary. he later did something that presidential candidates rarely do -- admit they made a mistake. "i did not do well on saturday night, so listen to this," he told a crowd after his fifth place finish. "that will never happen again." but the damage was done and his campaign never recovered.       8 unforgettable presidential debate blunders      
__label__0 (cnn)voters using google to research candidates in competitive house races this year might not realize that the "voter guide" that pops up in their browser is actually funded by a house republican political group. the new digital tactic has frustrated democrats who claim the site gives the appearance of being non-partisan when it instead presents gop attack lines. the campaign manager for luann bennett, a democratic candidate in northern virginia who is challenging gop rep. barbara comstock, found "voterguide2016.com" when he was searching his boss' name. while the layout and biographical information was fairly straightforward, the language on the campaign matchup immediately resembled gop talking points. the "need to know" section describes bennett's record as "making promises she doesn't keep, like promising to build a preschool and daycare center with green space and a playground for the dc community. however, she never completed it." the "on the issues" area proclaims bennett supported "president obama's nuclear deal with iran, even though it allows iran, a state sponsor of terrorism, the ability to eventually produce its own nuclear weapons." on comstock the site describes the freshman lawmaker as "an independent leader" and lists several issues that are top items on the minds of voters in the area: "opioids, traffic congestion, metro funding -- barbara has been in the thick of today's public policy debates." at first glance the "voterguide2016.com" website looks like a neutral source. it features pictures of candidates of both parties in more than two dozen districts, with maps and sections labeled "trending" and "candidates." it doesn't specify that a "republican" created it. but if you scroll all the way down to the bottom you find in small print the initials for the party committee that indicate it is a biased webpage -- "paid for by the nrcc and not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee. www.nrcc.org" the nrcc is the capitol hill-based national republican congressional committee, the main political arm for house republicans. democratic campaigns in roughly eight swing house races realized that the gop strategy involved not only creating the site, but also buying geo-targeted google search terms to drive people to it. when voters in these districts type in candidate names the search engine lists this republican generated page at the top of the results. it's not against any rules, but democrats who reviewed the sections and what is designed to look like analysis on the site told cnn the tactic was "misleading and underhanded." robert howard, spokesman for bennett's campaign, criticized comstock's party for the strategy, telling cnn, "without a record to stand on and an agenda more in line with trump than her constituents, it's no shock she and her allies would resort to deceiving voters with a fake website." but according to advertising strategists this approach is a natural extension of how the parties already use contrasting messages. outside advocacy groups regularly prepare voter guides to give to voters to specify which candidates back their causes. "over 40% of all digital advertising is search. it would be silly to ignore this, whether you are selling soap or political candidates," one leading digital ad strategist, who is not affiliated with either political party, told cnn. the nrcc's "independent expenditure" or "ie" arm is responsible for the site not the committee itself, according to one senior republican source. this separate group uses millions to run ads and support gop candidates but cannot coordinate with the nrcc or individual campaigns. no one from the ie would talk to cnn about what they are spending on the site or why they chose to use the model it on a voter guide. independent expenditure groups are established by both party committees and frequently produce some of the more negative political ads during the campaign season. they give the candidates and the party some cover because while they can't talk directly about their content, they can mimic messaging to help reinforce how races are framed. katie martin, spokeswoman for the nrcc views the new website as part of the broader effort to reach voters, telling cnn republicans are "constantly working to find new, creative, and innovative ways to target voters online." many house candidates on both sides already establish websites to attack their opponents. but when they buy the domain name election laws require that they disclose the campaign is behind the effort. for example, the bennett campaign bought "stoptrumpcomstock.com" which links the gop congresswoman to donald trump, the gop presidential nominee, who is unpopular in the district. democratic campaign operatives maintain that this particular voter guide site is in a different category because it is an attacking candidates under the premise that it is presenting unbiased information without making it clear that one political party is paying. martin, not surprisingly, disagrees, telling cnn, "while democrats might cry foul because they want to continue to hide from their records, the nrcc is happy to make their positions known in a smart and completely transparent way digitally." it's unclear how much traffic the site will get, and whether it will translate into actual votes in november. democrats will have to decide whether it's worth shifting money out of ad budgets earmarked for television commercials on local stations, which are the most expensive line item with the broadest reach, or to counter with their own digital response.       house republicans disguise attacks on democrats in digital 'voter guide'      
__label__0 the axe files, featuring david axelrod, is a podcast distributed by cnn and produced at the university of chicago institute of politics. the author works for david axelrod. kiev (cnn)he was one of the most effective legislators in washington, an icon of democratic politics. now barney frank says the left has been outmaneuvered by the tea party and the populist right. "to my great regret, the tea party movement has had much more impact on american politics than occupy wall street," frank, former congressman from massachusetts, said to david axelrod on "the axe files" podcast, produced by the university of chicago institute of politics and cnn. "because the tea party people correctly understood that, for them, what they needed to do was to get control of the political machinery, to register people to vote, to vote in primaries, and influence public policy," frank continued. "occupy wall street decided that they would bring about great change by smoking pot and having drum circles, and it turns out voting in primaries is a better way to do it." the key to bringing about political change, frank believes, is not allowing one's ideals to overwhelm the sense of moral duty inherent in public service. "i do believe that, clearly, idealism comes first. you don't belong trying to run other people's lives unless you're committed to ideals," frank said. "but the more idealistic you are, the more morally you are obligated to be pragmatic." clinton, trump poised for historic debate battle the conversation with frank was taped in kiev around the yalta european strategy conference, at which frank and axelrod participated in a panel discussion on the american election. during his more than 30 years in congress, frank had been involved in some of washington's most consequential policy debates, including the bipartisan federal bailout of the financial industry in 2008 and the subsequent dodd-frank financial reform and consumer protection legislation enacted in 2010. frank, who retired from congress in 2013, says he can't help but feel somewhat pessimistic when he reflects on the deterioration of bipartisanship in washington and the legislative paralysis it has spawned. however, if hillary clinton is elected president, then frank, a staunch supporter of her candidacy, is cautiously hopeful that our nation's political gridlock will lessen. "if hillary clinton wins, one of the benefits, i hope, will be that the republicans will take their party back. that's all that needs to happen," frank said. "you don't need huge changes. you just need conservatives who believe in governance arguing with liberals who believe in governance." to hear the whole conversation with frank, which also covered the corrupt machine politics in his childhood home of hudson county, new jersey; why he blames newt gingrich for the excessive partisanship that has come to define washington, d.c.; and why clinton's email issue has been an anchor on her candidacy, click on http://podcast.cnn.com. to get "the axe files" podcast every week, subscribe at http://itunes.com/theaxefiles.       barney frank: tea party outmaneuvered dems      
__label__0 (cnn)hillary clinton and donald trump are still hours away from squaring off in the first debate of the 2016 race, but the pre-debate spin between each campaign is already well underway. here's a glimpse at the expectations game waged by campaign surrogates who made the television rounds monday morning. trump 'can't hide' - clinton running mate tim kaine at a rally monday "the thing about 90 minutes is boy, you can't hide. now donald trump likes to say, you know, 'i'm going to build this wall, then i'm not taking any questions,' but okay, when you've got 90 minutes and there's just a moderator and two of you on stage, you can run but you can't hide." moderators on notice - trump running mate mike pence on hugh hewitt's radio show "my confident hope in the debate tonight and our debate and the other two presidential debates (is that) the moderators will ask the questions and they'll allow the candidates to answer the questions. and the rest of you people afterwards can do all the commentating and let the american people decide." fact-checker - clinton campaign press secretary brian fallon on cnn's "new day" "there is enough lies that donald trump tells consistently that everyone should be able to call him out -- (debate moderator) lester holt, hillary clinton will, too. but i think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching, that are grading the candidates' performances should take it into account." he'll 'be himself' - trump campaign spokesman jason miller on cnn's "new day" "mr. trump is going to be very prepared for this evening, but the key point to make about mr. trump is that he's going to go in there with the clarity and conviction of a candidate who knows exactly what his vision is, exactly how he wants to help the country. and so he's going to go in there and essentially be himself. and that's something that's really easy to prepare for. secretary clinton has a much bigger challenge, she's trying to program all of her lines and figure out what poll-tested methods are going to work tonight." just the facts - clinton campaign manager robby mook, appearing on nbc's "today" show: "all that we're asking from donald trump is that he stick with the facts, that he give clear plans and that he have a command of the issues. that's how we think the candidates should be judged. "that's how they've been judged in the past. what we don't want to have is some kind of double standard where donald trump can get the most improved award but hillary clinton is getting judged on the fine points of policy." lowering expectations - trump campaign manager kellyanne conway, appearing on nbc's "today" show "robby and i are living in parallel universes. donald trump has been criticized all weekend long. i think that the clinton campaign has clearly been talking to the media for a week now saying it's your job to make sure that donald trump is checked -- fact-checked in real time. i'm just surprised the campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. "look, they know that campaign debates are not hillary clinton's sweet spot. yes, she is experienced at doing them but the experience hasn't necessarily been beneficial. i've been asking voters formally, can you name anything from a debate that you've seen from hillary clinton that really moves you or that you remember and they can't. she's been in 34 of them." 14 season finales of "the apprentice" - republican national committee chairman reince priebus on cnn's "wolf" "he's studying and he's preparing and they're going through hypotheticals and what scenarios might come up. but he's very comfortable, he did a great job in our primary debates. he's also been through 14 season finales, he will be prepared." season finales are "showmanship" - mook responds to priebus on cnn's "wolf" "you asked him about donald trump's qualifications in his approach tonight and he stressed he's had 14 season finales of the apprentice, and i think they really are hoping to coast on style and his television showmanship." watch the women - clinton supporter rep. jim himes, a connecticut democrat, appearing on cnn's "new day" "remember, donald trump has never gone one-on-one in a debate with anyone, much less a woman. so i think there's huge risk if he goes after her in that fashion that a lot of in particular women will say, 'holy smokes that's out of bounds.'" trump is unpredictable - trump supporter rep. peter king, a new york republican, appearing on cnn's "new day." "i'm confident he will adapt and say what he has to say or protect his style. ted cruz is different than hillary clinton and he sort of adapted his attacks to each opponent. i think you'll see a line of argument and attack, if you will, that is different. again, we have to wait and see because i don't think anyone can predict what donald trump will do, but i think he will do very well." cnn's betsy klein, elizabeth landers, tom lobianco and david wright contributed to this report.      pre-debate spin lightning round: surrogates sound off and trash talk      
__label__0 (cnn)last year saw an increase in violent crime -- including murder -- compared to 2014, according to new data released by the federal bureau of investigation on monday. the annual findings showed an estimated 1,197,704 violent crimes, up 3.9% from 2014, while the murder rate spiked by 10.8% over the same span. those crimes include "murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault," the fbi's website said. but the report indicated that violent crime is still below 2006 and 2011 levels for 10-year and five-year comparisons. the numbers are somewhat expected, reflecting both anecdotal and statistical evidence of an increase in violence since last october. that trend has been visible in several large cities, including chicago, baltimore and washington. other major cities such as new york and los angeles have not experienced the same. attorney general loretta lynch said the data show "we still have so much work to do," but stressed the overall numbers are down compared to several years ago. "violent crime tears at the fabric of our common life -- and so any increase in violent crime is of the deepest concern to me as attorney general and to the entire department of justice," lynch said. the findings are part of the fbi's annual crime data report, which is released around the same time every year. they are certain to figure prominently in this year's presidential race, perhaps as early as monday evening, when hillary clinton and donald trump square off in the first general election debate at hofstra university in hempstead, new york. a similar trend of increasing violent, concentrated in some cities, appears to have continued into 2016. data from the largest us cities for the first half of the year shows continued increase in violence in some big cities.       fbi data: violent crime up in 2015 vs 2014, still down from 5 years ago

"the scope of work to be accomplished while the monument is closed and the duration of the closure are still being determined; we expect to have an announcement with those additional details in the next couple of weeks," the national park service said in a statement. repairs were expected to be over by mid-september. however, determining the reasons for the elevator issues has taken longer than expected, national park service spokesman mike litterst told cnn on monday. "basically, we've had to make the difficult decision to keep the monument closed until the modernization work on the elevator is completed," litterst said, characterizing the move as a "long-term" closure. the monument was shut down in mid-august when a cable broke lose in the elevator that takes visitors on a 555-foot ride up the structure to take in sky-high views of the nation's capital. litterst said that although national park service officials previously considered the theory that a 2011 earthquake could have contributed to the elevator problems, a third-party inspector didn't "see any evidence" that the earthquake is a factor. a block-by-block inspection of the monument began in august 2011, after the structure experienced ground motion from the 2011 earthquake that struck the neighboring state of virginia.       washington monument closed indefinitely following elevator issues

"be yourself and explain what motivates you. because i will tell you, i've gotten to know hillary and seen her work and seen her in tough times and in good times. she's in this for the right reasons," obama told abc news. "i think there's a reason why we haven't had a woman president before, and so she's having to break down some barriers. there's a level of mistrust and a caricature of her that just doesn't jibe with who i know." earnest said monday he was confident the debate's moderator, nbc anchor lester holt, would "perform well, even under the intense spotlight of a presidential debate."       obama to watch potential successors debate on tv 'in the background'

reagan rolls carter the incumbent president jimmy carter wanted to talk about ronald reagan's work as governor of california. but reagan had heard enough -- and bet that voters felt the same way. as carter finished a long point with a comment on his opponent's "typical" positions, reagan stepped in with four words: "there you go again." obama mocks mitt mitt romney had been hammering president barack obama for having downsized parts of the armed forces. but obama turned it around on his 2012 challenger, mocking and painting him as out of touch with modern foreign policy questions. when romney trounced obama on the question of the smaller number of naval ships, obama said: "well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. we have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. we have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines." a killer joke in 1984, reagan sent republicans into a panic with a garbled opening debate performance against walter mondale. 8 unforgettable presidential debate blunders the baltimore sun's henry trewhitt asked if the president's age would keep him from being able to do the job. here is reagan's cheeky response, which mondale would later describe as having effectively ended the race: "not at all. and, mr. trewhitt, i want you to know also i will not make age an issue of this campaign. i am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience." lloyd bentsen knew jack kennedy, then he owned dan quayle you can see it about 15 seconds into the clip. vice presidential candidate sen. lloyd bentsen's brow shoots up as dan quayle, george h.w. bush's 1988 running mate, answers a question about his relative inexperience, saying, "i have as much experience in the congress as jack kennedy did when he sought the presidency." bentsen fired back: "senator, i served with jack kennedy. i knew jack kennedy. jack kennedy was a friend of mine. senator, you're no jack kennedy." mondale buries the "hatchet man" before he was a warmly remembered war hero who lost his own presidential race in a 1996 landslide to bill clinton, bob dole had a different kind of notoriety. during a 1976 vice presidential debate with walter mondale, he showed why. asked if watergate, and then president gerald ford's pardon of richard nixon, were off-limits, dole launched into a long rant essentially blaming "democrat wars" for killing millions of americans. mondale hit back with one line: "i think sen. dole has richly earned his reputation as a hatchet man tonight." perot sets himself apart with his texas twang, ross perot made a serious dent in the 1992 presidential race. here he underlines why his lack of experience in government was going to be a political asset: "i don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. i don't have any experience in gridlock government, where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. i don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent crime-ridden society in the industrialized world. but i do have a lot of experience in getting things done." lincoln prints and publishes his debate zingers though the words were spoken during one of their celebrated 1858 senate debates, abraham lincoln was so pleased with his performance against stephen a. douglas, he took the transcripts (which he edited, liberally, on his own) and published them in a book before their 1860 presidential rematch. in arguing that douglas was using a flimsy principle as a bogus pretext for spreading slavery nationwide, lincoln mockingly asked what remained of the substance of his rival's position: "has it not got down as thin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death?" gore questions (the first) bush's resume al gore was running for vice president in 1992, but that didn't mean he wasn't aiming high. here is the shot he took at george h.w. bush, who had sought to attach his record to that of his former boss reagan, during a three-way debate with dan quayle and adm. james stockdale: "george bush taking credit for the berlin wall coming down is like the rooster taking credit for the sunrise." bush shakes off gore sometimes, words are unnecessary. at 11:58 in this clip, early on in his debate with al gore, george w. bush responds to the vice president's ill-timed stroll and apparent attempt to intimidate him with a simple -- but devastating -- silent shake of his head.       fight nights past: best debate knockout lines      
__label__0 (cnn)hillary clinton and donald trump will each arrive at monday night's debate in hempstead, new york with an ample contingent of campaign aides and surrogates. but the two candidates will also bring a handful of individuals carefully chosen to emphasize a campaign message. the guests include a 9/11 survivor, a pair of military generals and a billionaire who enjoys trash talk nearly as much as trump. below is each candidate's guest list, as confirmed by their campaigns: clinton: mark cuban: the brash owner of the nba's dallas mavericks, has emerged as one of clinton's fieriest attack dogs, repeatedly taunting trump both on twitter and the campaign trail. cuban was at it again last week, tweeting that he would be in the front row at monday night's debate, which he dubbed "the 'humbling at hofstra.'" trump fired back, threatening to bring get gennifer flowers a seat next to cuban. flowers, who in the 1970s had an affair with future president bill clinton, told the new york times that she would be in attendance, but the trump campaign insisted that it had not invited her. lauren manning: an injured survivor of 9/11 who met clinton while she recovered from the attacks. manning also spoke at the democratic national convention in philadelphia this summer. obama to watch potential successors debate maxine outerbridge: described by the clinton campaign as a "single mom and a domestic violence survivor" who credits the children's health insurance program, which clinton helped create as first lady, for her success. anastasia somoza: born with cerebral palsy, somoza first met clinton as a nine-year-old. she introduced the democratic nominee before a speech in orlando, and appears in a new clinton campaign ad. aleatha williams: a bronx native, williams has maintained a relationship with clinton since the democratic nominee was first lady. trump bobby knight: the legendary former college basketball coach endorsed trump in april ahead of the indiana primary. knight, a three-time national champion as head coach at indiana university known for his volcanic temper, has referred to the republican presidential nominee as "saint donald." mark geist: a marine corps veteran and security contractor, geist survived the 2012 attack on the us consulate in benghazi, libya. he appeared in an nra ad earlier this summer titled, "stop clinton, vote trump." team trump: no gennifer flowers at debate karen vaughn: vaughn, whose navy seal son died in afghanistan, was a rare ally for trump in august, when the candidate sparred with a gold star family. gen. mike flynn: an early supporter of trump, the retired three-star general has also served as an informal adviser to gop nominee. gen. keith kellogg: a former army lieutenant general, kellogg is a national security adviser to trump. he and flynn teamed up last week to write a rebuttal to former defense secretary robert gates, who said that trump is "beyond repair" on national security. cnn's jim acosta and dan merica contributed reporting.      clinton and trump: who's on the debate guest list      
__label__0 (cnn)name-calling has been the norm this political season, but it's unclear what salutations hillary clinton and donald will use when they meet face-to-face monday night. past debates have usually featured a degree of formality and respect above harsh campaign trail rhetoric. will that hold in 2016? there's at least some reason to think gop nominee trump and democratic rival clinton will tone it down monday, based on some of the nicer ways they've addressed each other. clinton, trump poised for historic debate battle yes, clinton frequently uses trump's last name derisively, as "trump." but she's just as likely to refer to him to "donald trump" and sometimes even "mr. trump." he's famously tagged former secretary of state clinton "crooked hillary." but he also regularly refers to her "hillary," "hillary clinton" and from to time "secretary clinton." will one or both reference a past role of their opponent? say a back-handed compliment from clinton about a "reality tv star"? or will they exude a degree of familiarity by using first names only, with "hillary" or "donald"? how to address debate opponents has been a stumbling block before for national candidates. in 2008 sarah palin, the gop vice presidential nominee, referred to her democratic rival, then-sen. joe biden of delaware, as "senator o'biden." though she had begun the debate asking if she could refer to him as "joe." her mistake about his last name proved a fleeting issue. 5 things to watch at monday night's clinton-trump debate with the power to set a tone, distract from message and help create a memorable sound bite, there could be a lot in a name come monday evening. watch the video above for a sampling of how 2016 candidates have referred to their opponents over the past year.       they can't say that on a debate stage -- or can they?      
__label__1 the rioters in charlotte may think they’re protesting racism and police brutality, but the only racists to be found in that city are them. the national guard has been called in due to the rioting over a black cop killing a black man who the cops say came out of his car pointing a gun. in the past two days rioters attempted to throw a photographer in a fire last, three officers were hurt, a man was shot and is on life support, stores and the local arena were trashed. obviously the live of the black cop doesn’t matter, as i doubt there would’ve been a riot if he was killed instead. in charlotte, white people and journalists are fair game for attack. for some reason, hillary clinton has taken the sides of these rioters in attempting to pander to the black lives matter crowd, which is going to backfire for her. most black people hate blm, she’s only going to attract a fringe minority to her side while alienating millions more. if you are in charlotte, there is a way you can keep yourself save, however. as the federalist papers reported: a white man was able to drive through a crowd of angry protesters without incident – because he brandished his pistol. the unnamed driver approached a crowd of demonstrators chanting “no justice! no peace!” and waving signs that said “f**k the police!” as the crowd began to surround him, he pulled out his weapon in his hand, stuck it out the door and pointed it at the ground. the atmosphere of the crowd immediately changed once that happened. check out the awesome video below: serves them right. it truly amazes me that these riots have time to stay out to late at night and block off roads as innocent people try to get through. don’t these people have jobs to wake up for early in the morning? oh, wait… of course not.       video: shocking reason white man escaped charlotte riots alive      
__label__1 let’s just put it this way: if donald trump’s campaign was found guilty of this crime, the media would pre-emptively announce his resignation and carry him out of town, pitchforks and torches in hand. however, hillary clinton is apparently immune to any criticism in the media. don’t know what i’m talking about? let me fill you in. the campaign hillary4america, a group that advocates for the policies of hillary clinton, was searching for recruits to go to the polls and preach the word of clinton. two things are wrong with this: first, it’s illegal to go to a polling/voter registration place and tell people who to vote for. it’s the reason why candidates can’t go to a polling/voter registration place and talk with voters, despite bill clinton doing it anyway and the media staying quiet about it. this seems like a clear cut case of voter manipulation and fraud. second, the idiots behind hillary4america didn’t know that one of their prospective recruits, the very people they were instructing to violate voter laws, had a hidden camera on the whole time and exposed them for the crooks they really are. here is the entire thing, caught on tape. if this doesn’t clue you in into the mindset of people voting for hillary, i don’t know what will. hidden cam shows hillary4america training recruits to deliberately break voter registration law!pic.twitter.com/l3glipf1vv #morningjoe #fbi — jaazee (@jaazee1) august 22, 2016  want more? here’s yet another hillary campaign volunteer registering people to vote with signs that are against donald trump. when she’s pressed on her partisan hackery, she just runs away when she realizes that she’s being filmed. yeah, sure sounds familiar, doesn’t it?  we need to get out and vote to make sure that this particularly virulent strain of political manipulation gets left behind for good. who’s with me?

__label__1 the only convincing reason i can see for raising taxes is that it’ll mean less money in the pockets of george soros. while liberals bemoan money in politics, it’s often those liberals funded by the likes of soros doing the complaining. as of 2016, his net worth is nearly $25 billion. the right-wing koch brothers (worth 42.5 billion apiece) are wealthier, but soros “invests” much more in politics than soros does. soros started the open society institute in 1993 as a way to redistribute his wealth to progressive causes.  using open society as a conduit, soros has given more than $10 billion to a who’s who of left-wing groups. imagine how many hungry people worldwide that much money could’ve saved, but instead he put that money towards organizations bent on destroying our civil society. this partial list of recipients of soros’ money says it all: acorn, apollo alliance, national council of la raza, tides foundation, huffington post, southern poverty law center, soujourners, people for the american way, planned parenthood, and the national organization for women. on the bright side, at least it’s his money he’s wasting going towards these causes, not federal money. at eighty-six years of age, the man is nearing the end of his life, and throwing money to whoever will take it at this point. he’s heavily backed black lives matter, and now, is putting his money where his mouth is on the refugee issue. as weasel zippers reports: billionaire george soros said in an opinion piece in the wall street journal that he would invest $500 million to meet the needs of migrants. the white house announced the commitment from soros and around 50 other companies ahead of obama convening a refugee summit tuesday afternoon. soros also said that he plans to work more closely with the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees and the international rescue committee to assist in his investments. ‘in response, i have decided to earmark $500 million for investments that specifically address the needs of migrants, refugees and host communities. i will invest in startups, established companies, social-impact initiatives and businesses founded by migrants and refugees themselves. although my main concern is to help migrants and refugees arriving in europe, i will be looking for good investment ideas that will benefit migrants all over the world.’ ‘governments must play the leading role in addressing this crisis by creating and sustaining adequate physical and social infrastructure for migrants and refugees.’ the lifetime cost of admitting only the 10,000 refugees we admitted in america comes out to a large $6.5 billion. george soros isn’t going to be getting much bang for his buck (especially when its ten times cheaper to resettle refugees in the middle east than in america and europe) but if he wants to waste his money, i’m all for that. i’d rather him not have it anyway.       soros is spending $500 million to bring this to america” – pos      
__label__1 an english man, liam edwards, has been arrested and now awaits trial because he placed some anti-halal stickers on meat products at a local grocery store in his hometown of salford. halal refers to the method in which muslims prepare meat before and after slaughter. edwards rightfully opposes halal because it hosts ties to not only terrorism, but animal cruelty as well. the stickers read, “beware! halal is barbaric and funds terrorism #banhalal”:  just a month ago, for instance, an undercover video shot by an animal charity organization showed muslims at a north yorkshire slaughterhouse “sawing at the animals’ necks with seemingly blunt knives, stamping on the sheep and kicking them in the head as they attempted to get them onto the conveyor belt.” furthermore, according to an australian anti-islamic activist known only as ms. smith, the money procured from halal slaughterhouses tends to be used to fund extremism. added to this is the fact that those brands who choose to purchase halal-certified meat must pay an islamic religious tax. none of these facts apparently matter to the prosecuting attorney in liam’s case, holly holden, who opined in court that “the point about animal slaughter can be expressed in a different way without suggesting halal and terrorism is linked.” as a result, liam now faces charges of “racially or religiously aggravated criminal damage” and must go to trial on july 23 (h/t breitbart). i guess offending muslims with facts is not acceptable in england. it’s a shame liam doesn’t live in the united states, where the first amendment protects every citizen’s right to speak (or write) the truth, regardless of whom that truth offends. please share this post on facebook if you too find animal cruelty and terrorism to be far more offensive than fact-based anti-halal stickers. via conservative tribune       photo: here’s the “offensive” sticker muslims found on their halal meat… now they’re suing      
__label__1 president obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. their is no denying that. why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the affordable care act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. well apparently he has not changed his tune. because president obama appeared at his final united nations general assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting president. while there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about american freedom that will have most americans absolutely flabbergasted at. during his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. maintaining that the united states would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. he went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the united nations for example. obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. but apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. he even admitted that amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. i hope he’s enjoying that gilligan’s island by himself. how ridiculous! he knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. that perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses washington d.c. right now. if the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. it’s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. then they wonder why they misbehave. watch president obama’s full speech here,        nasty surprise: obama told americans that their freedom is over and new world government is taking over!!!      
__label__1 you know america has gone wrong when we’re letting transgender men with a penis waltz into the women’s bathroom, black protesters turn things into a riot, and now you can’t even express anger, at your own business, with a violent, child marrying, religion like islam without people getting mad at you. what the f*ck happened to america? back when i was younger no one cared about your feelings. people got things done. people worked hard. people bashed and roasted each other in good humor and we had strong families, good work ethics, and we loved throwing back a cold beer during football games and cracking stereotype jokes because those are literally the best kinds of jokes to laugh at. but not now. rich millionaire athletes can’t celebrate a touchdown. women have to pee next to a man who can’t figure out his f*cking gender from a hole in the wall. people are labeled as racist if they make any comment whatsoever about race, even when the stereotypical jokes are funny because they are true. and now, in america, you can’t even put up your own sign on your own business without the snowflake idiots of america crying about how offensive it is. well screw those people. we found another hero among wimps and his name is dan ruedinger. he’s awesome because he’s not afraid to express his distaste for a creepy religion. he doesn’t want muslims in his family restaurant. you know why, because the religion of islam sucks. there’s too many terrorists, woman beaters, and child marrying sickos in that religion and it’s time to put a foot down. dan put up a sign on his restaurant that seriously infuriated muslims all across the planet. i bet there was at least 20 goats humiliated from the backside on the day dan’s sign saying “muslims get out” was first seen by an islamic person. oh well. go bang your goats and marry the first graders while thinking about the 72 male virgins waiting to take your rear virginity when you detonate a clock bomb somewhere.  wonder what it said? let’s zoom in a little bit!    madworld media – dan ruedinger, owner of treats family restaurant, was sickened when he heard about the recent islamic terrorist attacks in minnesota, new york, and new jersey. instead of ignoring what had happened like so many people are, dan decided to take a bold stand by placing a sign in front of his restaurant with three bold words – “muslims get out.” if i saw a family of people with their faces covered walking into a restaurant, then i’d ask them to remove the garments. i don’t know if they’re going to bomb something or order pancakes and if i made it out alive, then i’d want to identify them if i could. and since i think dan’s sign is funny, and his right to express his distaste for a religion that’s responsible for so many sick things, then i bet that makes me a stereotypical racist islamaphobe. cool. next time you hear about a terrorist attack, remember, dan’s sign was right. and is this the kind of people you want in your restaurant?        fed up restaurant owner puts up sign that infuriates muslims everywhere      
__label__1 what do tim tebow and colin kaepernick have in common? neither is a starting quarterback in the nfl. the other difference is that tim tebow is a man of high class and well respected. the other is an idiot. tim tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about colin kaepernick’s protest towards the national anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people. tebow is known for his religious antics, “tebowing” celebration, and not being able to make it on another nfl team.   his comments about kaepernick were as follows… “when people have belief in something,” said tebow, “or conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it’s all about standing for it the right way.’ keyword is “standing” which kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. he’s a high paid bench player and he’s being disrespectful to the fans and americans. if he wants to protest, that’s cool, but he should do it on his own time. he can do it on twitter, facebook, outside of a mcdonald’s next to people asking for $15 an hour. he can go on tour and to a black lives matter riot. he can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest. and let’s not forget that no one in this country is oppressed. claiming you’re oppressed is really you admitting you’re lazy and don’t want to work for anything. how did obama become president? was he oppressed? we have a black president. the guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn’t oppressed. name one person who is oppressed and i guarantee i can tell you why they are not. i can tell you what they can do to better themselves. i can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life. if anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called affirmative action. tim tebow was short on words because he’s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. he’s too busy working on his career path. good for tim and i hope he lands a roster spot on the new york mets. god knows the mets need help! screw kaepernick.       tebow dismantles national anthem protests in one sentence…boom!      
__label__1 hillary clinton appeared on steve harvey on tuesday and expressed the feeling that she wanted to be instrumental in improving policing tactics in the united states. specifically she was referencing the recent shooting of terence crutcher in tulsa, oklahoma by a white female police officer. it is now dominating the news as leftists and black lives matter activists are simultaneously going crazy. she said, “how many times do we have to see this in our country? this is unbearable and it needs to be intolerable. maybe i can, by speaking directly to white people [and] say, ‘look this is not who we are.’ we’ve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. we can do better. we have got to rein in what is absolutely inexplicable.” it is funny how she almost appears to be endorsing the idea that african american people are unjustly oppressed and discriminated against in the united states. black people often say that one black person is not representative of the entire african american race. yet, she thinks that as a white woman she can speak for all white people? that is pretty ignorant. not even considering the fact that more people in her party like senator bernie sanders than her. crutcher’s family released the violent video of his death at the hands of a police officer on tuesday. the tulsa police chief said to the media during a press conference that no firearm was found at the scene of the shooting. the police officer indicated she shot crutcher because he motioned his hand into the car as if to grab something which she had believed was a firearm. which would seem to corroborate the belief that crutcher was unarmed and not a danger to the police officers. to think that all one needs to do is “talk to white people” in order to quell the issue of systemic racism or brutality against african americans is absolutely ludicrous. you would think that for a seasoned politician clinton would understand that it is actions and not words that effect real change. but clinton is usually all talk and no walk. considering the fact she changes her opinions on issues as quickly as the cash from private lobbyists and wall street backers is created.       hillary tells steve harvey she’ll help stop police shootings by doing this to ‘white people’      
__label__1 a border wall isn’t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure. china didn’t build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders. we need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. the entire nation of mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they’ve racked up a death toll that would make isis envious. additionally, if isis is going to enter america, our unsecured southern border is their best bet.  and for that reason, you can bet they already are trying… as the conservative tribune reported: eight syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the united states from mexico on monday, raising new concerns about security inside the united states in the wake of the paris terror attacks. breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the syrians were intercepted at the juarez lincoln bridge in laredo, texas. while border patrol has yet to confirm this report, national border patrol council local 2455 president hector garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. “border patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that syrians crossed the u.s. border from mexico in the laredo sector,” he said. “our agents have heard about syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. at this time, i cannot confirm or deny that syrians have crossed, for security reasons.” it would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the obama administration let border patrol do their jobs. border patrol agent hector garza, acting in his role as president of the national border patrol council, local 2455 said on fox news earlier this month that  “eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the united states,” garza explained. “unfortunately for border patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.” we need a border and stronger border security – and there’s only one presidential candidate willing to help with both.       breaking: federal agents make massive discovery at southern border… isis is here      
__label__1 watch this thug knock out two beefy girls in a restaurant (video below), then we’ll have a fun chat about it afterwards. maybe some wine and frogs, but that’s none of my business. so the skinny guy in the wife-beater, how appropriate, was arguing with the two booger monster looking ladies who seem exactly like the type of gal a black man loves. you know, big ol hips, stanky tattoos, and lack of a father figure. they’re all going buck wild on each other and you know it’s only a matter of moments until someone gets triggered and ends up on worldstar hiphop. finally someone says something and it looks like some drink goes flying, glass shattering, fists flying boogaloo instead of people slurping down milkshakes and hamburgers. if soul train was a battle royal in a diner, then this would be it. if ed norton’s fight club was coed, then this would be it. i am jack’s big booty ho getting beat up by a black man.  he knocks out one crumb-eating gal with a right hand, then i can’t even tell what happened to the other lady. i just see blond hair flying, red shirts ripping, flea-bag cheap tattoos exposed and i was legitimately hoping a breast didn’t come out as i laughed at this awful video. normally i enjoy a fine chest peek during a chick fight, but i am not interested in women this size. not my type. after several rounds of fists and kicks, the man has now assaulted two women. the girls are pretty ugly, but that doesn’t make it ok to strike a woman. if he were a real man, he would have walked out with his dignity instead of sucker-punching it into the large forehead of these women. hillary clinton calls trump supporters deplorable, but she should probably show this video at her next rally if she’s not too sick to stand up and press play on the remote. if anything is deplorable, it’s this behavior and a man assaulting two women. hopefully they’re all arrested. and if you missed it, there was a cameo by the chef and a deplorable butt crack by the lady in the red shirt. i don’t want my strawberry pancakes at the diner interrupted by nonsense like this. do you?  if you really need to be disturbed. then imagine what would happen if this guy showed up to the fight. what on god’s given earth is this creature? don’t worry, that’s a man. you can look at it and not feel like a fake transgender creep in the target bathroom.  weird. i know.       thug tells 2 chicks “act like a man, you’re gonna get treated like a man” then does the unthinkable!

__label__1 two girls were out with their mother enjoying a meal at a restaurant in stockton, california. when they were done their meal, they left the restaurant and that’s when things went horribly south. the two teen girls, both about 100 lbs each, and their mother encountered a group of terrible people. it was a group of black lives matter supporters.  the group approached the three girls, beat them with punches and kicks, threw trash at them, screamed racist taunts about white people, and hurt them so badly that police had to rush the three girls to the hospital. what did these three girls have to do with anything? they were minding their own business enjoying some family time. maybe if the losers in black lives matter had a better family life at home, then they wouldn’t be so screwed up. black moms often have 5+ kids and don’t really take care of any of them. the black dads are often nowhere to be found. what kind of life is that? and no, it’s not racist to say that. it’s a fact, not a stereotype. take a walk through any urban neighborhood and ask these “mothers” why they have multiple kids, no job, and half the kids have a different last name. screwed up, right? one of the black lies thug attackers proved just how stupid these people are. this idiot bragged about the attack and how he got his “hits” in. he supposedly had a video too! when people found out what he did, they crucified him on facebook so bad that his account isn’t available anymore. maybe he closed it down and went into hiding. as of right now, i don’t believe he was arrested yet. if you’re in northern california and see this guy, then call the police and show them this article. he most likely lives in or around the stockton, california area. his picture is below on the left. he’s the scrawny latino looking loser who would’ve probably been beaten up by the teen girls if he didn’t have a gang with him.   black lives matter is a racist terror group. they have not done anything positive for the black community. all they do is beat people up, protest in the middle of the street, loot and riot, and cause chaos. no one will ever take black lives matter serious until they start acting like civil human beings. they’re a scummy joke of fatherless losers, unemployed skanks, and uneducated violent thieves. every member of black lives matter should reevaluate their life and ask themselves “why am i part of this terrible hate group?”       white teen girls savagely beaten, blm thug who did it made big mistake

__label__1 when donald trump said that he wanted to ban muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist. oh how wrong they were, and still are. first off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. this is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins. the insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the democrats. after seeing how the world is working, trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in. democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. well, this has got to sting:  the essential research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of australians agree that populist senator pauline hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. the top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that muslim migrants do not integrate nor share australian values. the poll was first conducted in early august and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers. so australians want to preserve australian values? that sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. yet, when trump says “america first” it’s suddenly racist. ok, yeah, that sounds logical. sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing coalition favour an end to muslim migration along with 40 per cent of labour voters and 34 per cent of green voters. “floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan australia”, is too big to ignore. he writes: “this not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “yes, they are more likely to vote coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of labor voters and one third of greens agree too. look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with hanson.” do you hear that, hillary? this is how you respond to people who oppose you. you don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. let’s get this done in november.

__label__1 update: buzzfeed has deemed that our description of the crime and the victims is false. we have utterly debunked buzzfeed’s claims. you can view our followup article here. ~~~ you can’t make this stuff up. people used to tell crazy stories, but have no way to prove if the story was true or not. then along came video. this is by far one of the craziest things i’ve ever seen. these guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort. because you know how fights are, they’re even better when they’re in the middle of a major road. out of nowhere someone lights them on fire. lights. them. on. fire. and they’re still in the middle of the road, running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car.  nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things i’ve watched since the casey anthony trial. what goes through someone’s deplorable brain when they’re thinking – well right about now is a great time to light these guys on fire. yup, let’s just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn. who carries the items needed for a good molotov cocktail anyway? was this premeditated? it’s not like i have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it’s a bloody mary on a sunday morning. back in the day, when people were a lot smarter and america was great, this would have been a lot different. if you see two people about to fight and they’re in the street, then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren’t getting hit by a car. the good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand. that was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them. nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let’s a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it. no one cares anymore. time to start caring about people and stop lighting them on fire.       two white men doused with gasoline, set on fire by blacks – media censored (video)      
__label__1 i can’t believe this nonsense. you’re going to be mad that i told you this. you’re going to wonder where the toughness of america went and what happened to make people think being a p*ssy is the way to be. when i look at cops, i envision people who are strong, tough, and hard working. except for that one overweight cop that every station has. you know, the guy who actually eats the donuts. forget him. he’ll be on desk duty eventually. i’m talking about real cops. the cops i know are all in good shape, work out, and run towards danger. they will save any person that’s in harms way. they don’t care if the person is white, black, or even muslim. a good cop saves everyone, and that’s what most cops are – good cops. and that’s how it’s supposed to be. but then there’s this idiot from the la police commission who wants cops to run away from armed suspects. are you kidding me? that’s ridiculous. cops are trained to eliminate threats, not run away from the threat while the criminal either gets away or hacks someone with a meat cleaver.  the daily caller – the los angeles police commission wants lapd police officers to run away when a suspect confronts them with a weapon, warns the los angeles police protective league, the labor union of the city’s police officers. hypothetically speaking, if i wanted to rob a bank tonight, could i go there with a knife and the cops will run away from me? i don’t have to stab anyone, i just have to show cops that i have a deadly weapon and the cops will run to their cars and drive away. is that how it works? that opens the pandora box for an unwarranted increase in crime based on the fact that lapd might be ordered to run away from violent perpetrators in the future. i guess the lapd won’t be allowed to save lives anymore. very sad state of affairs if this really happens. i hope every lapd cop does the right thing and does not listen to this nonsense. cops are trained for battle and they’re not afraid to eliminate a violent threat. and we should let them eliminate a threat if it puts anyone in danger. training people to run away, instead of eliminating, will generate a nation of p*ssy cops and that’s not who i want to protect me.       la police commission tells officers how to deal with armed suspects and it is insane      
__label__1 don’t stop sharing this until it’s burned into everyone’s minds what cops go through everyday. don’t stop sharing this until every american understands that sometimes officers have to make the most difficult decision of their lives… to fire on a suspect who they believe might try to kill them. warning: graphic video of an officer’s death below kyle dinkheller was a deputy with the laurens county sheriff’s department in georgia. he was 22 years old when he was killed in the line of duty. dinkheller’s story, and the video that captured his death have been part of police training for 15 years. the extremely graphic video which also captured dinkheller’s screams as he was shot 9 times, with a 10th and final fatal shot to his eye, is evidence as to why officers do not have the luxury of hesitating when confronted with a suspect who is disobeying orders. it was on monday, january 12, in 1998 when dinkheller pulled over andrew howard brannan for going almost 100 miles an hour near the town of dudley, georgia. the stop was uneventful, initially. when dinkheller pulled brannan over, brannan exited his vehicle, and the two greeted each other. brannan put his hands in his pockets shortly after. deputy dinkheller asked brannan to keep his hands in plain sight. that’s when the encounter went south. brannan became agitated, told dinkheller to shoot him, and then began dancing crazily on the road. dinkheller radioed for backup, and ordered brannan to desist and approach his police cruiser. brannan then rushed the deputy in an extremely hostile manner. dinkheller used his baton to keep brannan from reaching him. that’s when the suspect retreated towards his toyota pickup truck. brannan reached inside of his truck even though dinkheller ordered him not to do so. the suspect then produced an m1 carbine rifle. dinkheller can be heard repeatedly yelling at brannan to “put the gun down now!” deputy dinkheller continued telling brannan to drop his weapon for about 30 seconds. that’s when brannan opened fire. bullets can be seen hitting dinkheller’s cruiser’s window in the video. dinkheller returned fire, but did not hit brannan. with his magazine empty, dinkheller was forced to reload. it was at this point that brannan rushed the deputy and began to fire at him at close range. dinkheller, hit several times, is heard screaming in terror saying “sh-t! sh-t! stop now!” brannan then ran to the front of dinkheller’s cruiser and reloaded his weapon. dinkheller fired a shot at brannan, at which point brannan rushed the deputy while firing his rifle. dinkheller was hit several times. the 22-year-old’s screams are difficult to listen to. returning fire, one of the deputy’s bullets did in fact find its target, hitting brannan in the stomach, but it wasn’t enough to stop him. dinkheller, having been shot 9 times, was immobilized. that’s when brannan, standing over the body of dinkheller, took careful aim and shot him in the right eye while yelling “die f-cker!” brannan, now a murderer, ran to his truck and sped away. he was arrested the next morning. on january 28, 2000, brannan was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to death. the jury concluded that he “murdered dinkheller in a premeditated, torturous, and cruel manner.” fifteen years later brannan was executed. on january 13, 2015, he was given a lethal injection. while awaiting his execution brannan was asked why he killed deputy dinkheller. his response? “because he let me.” a few weeks prior to dinkheller’s death, the young deputy had been reprimanded for being to “aggressive” during traffic stops. he was afraid of losing his job if he overreacted while on patrol. many believe that was the reason he did not fire on brannan when he reached inside of his truck. truly tragic if that was the case. here are the still photos of the scene. the first is the outline of dinkheller’s body. his blood can been seen on the ground. the second photo is of dinkheller’s cruiser, and the evidence markers denoting where bullet casing were found.   every single person in america should see this video. especially black americans who believe they can disregard orders from police and not expect the most serious of consequences. deputy dinkheller gave his killer one too many chances. police academies nationwide use this video as a training tool as to why officers cannot hesitate in situations such as this. tulsa police officer betty shelby was just charged with first-degree manslaughter for shooting terence crutcher, a black man who ignored her orders not to return to his truck much like in this video. officer shelby most likely was shown this video during her training. she knew what the consequences could be if she hesitated. watch the video of deputy dinkheller, and the hesitation that lead to his death. warning: extremely graphic video & audio of a man’s last moments on earth  color of skin is irrelevant. when cops are confronted, they just want to make sure they don’t end up like the deputy in this video… dead. don’t stop sharing this. every american should see it. especially those in the african-american community. the perp who killed dinkheller was white, and he should have been shot the moment he reached into his truck. we’d expect the same if the perp was black. by jeff rainforth like jeff on facebook follow jeff on twitter       don’t stop sharing this! officer shot, dies screaming on camera – why cops can’t hesitate      
__label__1 sheriff david clarke talked to neil cavuto of fox news. clarke determines that the rioters behavior in charlotte is of primitive and subhuman nature. basically, he called them savage and uncivilized. sheriff clarke is right. if you watch any video footage of the charlotte riots, then you will see nothing but idiots running around like maniacs, people stealing and breaking into multiple stores, vehicles being damaged, people being attacked for no reason. it’s nothing by mayhem by maniacs. none of these people resemble civilized humans. clarke is right! these ingrates are subhuman. they’re less than human. they’re filthy degenerates who consistently ruin neighborhoods and they need to be fixed. when people commit crimes like this, then i don’t think they should be permitted to have kids. sounds rough and crazy, but i’d love to see the government waltz through one of these neighborhoods, see someone they saw looting, and revoke their right to have kids. hey, i saw you acting like an uncivilized moron in charlotte. you know what, you’re done having kids. unzip your pants and let’s sterilize you right here in front of everyone. if you’re that irresponsible now, then i can’t fathom you raising a child. if you do have a kid, they’ll be just like you, and we don’t want any of that. here’s what else happened in the interview with cavuto and clarke – they point out that keith lamont scott had a gun and would not drop his weapon. they point out the fact that democratic media outlets always refuse to provide that information. they want ratings. they want people mad. they’re literally spinning the story, or leaving out vital information, in order to get people irritated enough to riot, then they get some good ratings for covering it. it’s total nonsense and very irresponsible. in fact, i would say that the reason for the riots is the democratic news outlets. if they said from the start – the man had a gun, that’s why he got shot, then people wouldn’t really care. but that doesn’t get ratings, does it?  politistick – after cavuto pointed out that major news headlines in the democrat media complex, ranging from the washington post to the new york times, conveniently left out the fact that keith lamont scott, the black man shot by a black police officer, was armed and refused to drop his weapon, according to police, sheriff clarke, as is always the case, did not mince words in describing both the media malpractice as well as the rioters’ behavior. “it was done on purpose [the media leaving out that keith lamont scott had a gun] to stoke up anger and resentment by the liberal mainstream media,” sheriff clarke asserted. the combination of uncivilized subhuman behavior and information left out of the news is what causes bs riots. charlotte riots could have been avoided if democratic news outlets told the truth instead of pandering the urban culture for votes and ratings.       sheriff david clarke: charlotte riots ‘primitive’ and ‘subhuman’ behavior [video]      
__label__1 the students in teacher lee francis’ history class will probably never forget the lesson he taught on free speech… just not in the way he probably expected. days ago, a photo appearing to show a teacher (later identified as the aforementioned lee francis) francis, a teacher at massey hill classical high school in fayetteville, north carolina, was giving a lesson monday on the first amendment. his method? first, he tried to burn the american flag. then he tried to cut it. then he placed it on the floor and stepped on it. many, predictably, were outraged. however, francis said he wasn’t trying to offend students, just teach them the supreme court ruled such acts of free expression were protected. that sounds like a good excuse, but some of his actions make me question whether or not he’s telling the truth. according to fox news, in a phone interview he stated “do i regret what i did? absolutely not. would i do it again? all i can say is i did it and i stand by it.” he also said that he has obtained legal counsel. “there were some laws broken as far as photos of me taken that violate the county’s policies – and issues that could be considered defamation of character,” he said. riiiiiight. so he’s all for teaching freedom of speech, but taking a photo is where he draws the line? i don’t know if i’m buying it. regardless, as worldstarhiphop reported, he’s now been suspended and there’s an investigation pending. here’s how this whole ordeal has turned out thus far:  what do you all think? if he really was teaching a lesson on the first amendment, do you think this is an extreme way of teaching it? while i do find it distasteful, it is a reminder of the freedoms we’re afforded in america. most people around the world don’t have the same freedom.       nc teacher who stomped on american flag in class just got smacked by instant karma!

__label__1 sometimes when you try to be clever, it backfires… it’s always a gamble. in this case though, it was more like hillary backfired, had all 4 tires blow, and then gets out of the car just in time to get rammed by a passing ice-cream truck… the woman made an entrance to a song that was just not the right song to pick…sorta. it probably would have been fine, except cbs totally threw her under the bus… which…what?! anywho…get your laugh on, check this out.  daaaaang, someone needs to buy the person who wrote that script a drink! they provided us with some good entertainment right there. i mean… awkward! that whole thing about hillary, how ironic right? however, the dialogue between the anchors themselves and the awkward ‘it wasn’t me, it wasn’t me’ and sticking their heads up hillary’s you know what even further… was priceless. cowards really. so what if you read from a script, you don’t hold the thing up on air, wave it around and pass the blame over something you reported. it’s just tasteless in my opinion. she was probably freaking out, that she was going to be the next social media target for ridicule..blah blah blah. it’s sad really when you see people enslaved to that kind of fear…and when you are, that’s when you can label yourself a liberal. everything is an issue with them, because they didn’t get told the truth often enough growing up. hillary clinton walked out to james brown’s ‘i feel good’ … someone is still lying to her. the woman is not well… and as for feeling nice like sugar and spice? when did satan get a spice cabinet?       watch: hillary clinton makes her grand entrance with the most unfortunate song ever! lmao      
__label__1 man, at this rate i’m going to run out of places to shop. walmart proved and admitted they have cop-hating asshats working for them. this one happened in georgia… the daughter of an officer who is retiring went to get him a cake. on it, it said ‘blue lives matter’ with a think blue line on a black background. what the hell is racist about that? three workers (who should all be fired) refused to decorate the cake for the retirement party. these morons don’t seem to actually know the definition of ‘racist’. what’s worse is walmart admits this happened. this officer served faithfully on the force, risking his life every day for 25 years. and these mush heads decided that they were too offended to do a cake for a police officer. “one of the bakers told me the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake,” the police officer’s daughter said. then they should not be working there. shame on walmart for not firing these three cop-haters. from todd starnes: three walmart workers in mcdonough, georgia refused to decorate a “thin blue line” cake for a police officer’s retirement party because they said it was racist. a number of my georgia readers alerted me to the story and on saturday night i spoke directly with the police officer’s daughter. she asked that i not divulge her name and i’ve agreed to honor her request. “i was so shocked,” she told me. “i didn’t know what to do or say or anything. i was trying not to lose my temper or make a scene.” “the baker told me the blue line cake was racist” — police officer’s daughter “i just wanted to make my dad a cake to show how much i appreciated him.” as an alternative, the officer’s daughter suggested a chocolate-frosted cake with a horizontal, frosted blue line. but that design was also rejected by walmart’s cake decorator. “she said, ‘i don’t feel comfortable doing this,’” the cop’s daughter said. “i asked her, ‘is there something wrong with cops?’” after being rejected for a third time, the 21 year-old told the bakers, “i’ll find another bakery, thank you.” that walmart should be boycotted. it’s in mcdonough, georgia on willow drive for those of you who would like to let them know how you feel about this outrageous behavior. the officer’s daughter was far more polite than i would have been. i would have gladly made a huge, ongoing scene and then i would have called the media. then i would have gone to social media with it. i would have shamed them to hell and back. “i was disappointed,” she told me. “i go to walmart all the time — at least once a week spend hundreds of dollars. i just wanted to make my dad a cake to show how much i appreciated him.” this just pisses me off. a friend of the family did indeed put this on facebook and what do you know… management called the police officer’s wife and daughter and apologized. sort of. “he said he was so sorry,” the daughter said. “he offered to make the cake free of charge and he gave me a $50 gift card.” walmart confirmed the story, but they did not admit their employees called the cake racist. only that the employee made a ‘mistake’. damn right they did… i’d still boycott them. now, for the cherry on this cake. the manager offered to make and decorate a new cake. but there was just one problem — the cake decorators refused to comply. “so the manager told me that he would decorate it — but it looked terrible,” the police officer’s daughter said. “it doesn’t look professional.” in the end, the daughter did not have time to get a cake after all this. walmart should be ashamed. “it irritates me that in charlotte, north carolina, the walmart was looted and the cops were protecting them,” she said. “and you can’t make a cake for the people who are protecting you?” walmart has hired a bunch of low class, anti-cop bigots. they need to be fired and walmart needs to make this right.        walmart refused to make officers ‘racist’ retirement cake, wait till you see how “racist” it was!      
__label__1 a man from arizona spoke with reporters from the bbc and he did not hold back his opinions about a muslims and islam. the man was the founder of bombislam.com who outspokenly talks about the danger of islam in an uncensored way. he goes by the name robert and he spends his fridays taking videos of himself confronting muslims in phoenix.  he walks up to local muslims right outside of their mosques asking them questions about their faith with the quran in his hand. his videos are often controversial and confrontational. when he spoke to the reporters with the bbc they were horrified. robert called out islam and said that their prophet muhammad was a war mongering tyrant pedophile who married female child brides. that’s not going to sit well with many people, lol! robert said, “what we’re doing right now is we’re going to do a little protest…me and a few of my friends that lets these muslims know that they’re not going to get comfortable here in my state.” the bbc reporters were not impressed with his comments or actions. they called robert’s group and website an anti islamic hate group. that analysis is not remotely shocking at all. the bbc journalist narrated as robert defaced the quaran! saying, “robert rips out a page of the quran… under uk law, these extreme protesters could be arrested for religious hatred. but america’s first amendment protects robert’s freedom of speech.” when another reporter from another outlet asked for robert’s opinions on his interaction with the bbc reporter he went off on a tyrade. he clearly was not at all impressed with the british reporters. seems as though the feeling was entirely mutual. well, then no worries about hard feelings! robert said, “i told these guys if i were a british person, i would feel it was my duty to overthrow my government. when they asked if i owned a gun, i pulled out a gun right then and there and put it on the table. we ate at a place called raising canes, which serves chicken tenders, but one of the british dudes was a vegetarian so he could only eat fries and coleslaw (hahaha).  i knew the entire time, their documentary was going to be biased against guys like me, but i knew what i was doing and knew more people would like my protest than dislike it. they titled it “united states of hate: muslims under attack” or some sh*t like that. it’s still hilarious to me every time i watch it. i couldn’t have filmed and edited it better myself. they basically made my video for me that day.”  robert regularly updates his websites and goes on rants against the religion of islam. some are even video rants. while everyone certainly is on edge with the growing levels of islamic radical terrorism his videos seem very far to the right. labeling his videos as hate group propaganda isn’t necessarily an incorrect statement. nobody stands outside of churches or synagogues berating people about their christian or jewish faith with a bible in hand to degrade and defile their faith. that is just over the top.       fed-up american confronts muslims, shows them what he thinks of islam      
__label__1 this actually happened in june, but is just as pertinent today, especially with 20,000 to 30,000 syrian refugees due to arrive in the us next weekend. police in new mexico pulled over a woman driving a vehicle. the drive was an undocumented muslim woman from the middle east… that’s bad enough, but what is even worse is what she had in her car. the woman had plans for a gas pipeline with her. this just screams ‘terrorism’. i have no idea why they pulled her over, but it was a very good thing they did. it has been widely reported that hundreds, if not thousands, of islamic illegal immigrants are trying to get across our southern border. judicial watch released a report last summer saying that mexican cartels are smuggling foreigners from countries with terrorist links into the country. they furthermore released a second report just a few months ago saying that islamic terror groups residing in mexico have begun traveling to america in order to seek out potential targets. that border has now become a literal ticking time bomb of terrorism. it’s not ‘if’, it’s ‘when’ we get hit with a horrific terror attack that could kill thousands and it can all be laid at the feet of barack obama and the marxists who are for open borders. they want america to be like europe… europe which is toast because of the hijrah migration and terrorism. no thanks. from mad world news: police in new mexico recently pulled over a vehicle only to find that it was being driven by an undocumented, middle eastern woman. however, the situation got worse when they saw what she had in the car with her at the time – and now the surrounding area is on high alert. judicial watch indicates that a deputy sheriff in luna county, new mexico pulled over an unidentified “islamic refugee” for an undisclosed reason. luckily for everyone involved, the minor traffic infraction turned into so much more when the officer found plans for a gas pipeline in her possession. the pipeline is in deming, new mexico, and u.s. border patrol and the federal bureau of investigation’s (fbi) joint terrorism task forces (jttf) have been sent to the area to investigate. unfortunately, the find could only be indicative of what is to come. obama could bring in up to 250,000 islamic refugees this next year. he is seeding them across america in conservative strongholds in an effort to change the voting demographic and terraform the us into an islamic nation. bringing in unvetted islamists guarantees isis terrorists in their midst and obama is good with that. what’s a few dead infidels to him? the plans this woman had in her possession include the region around the small town of deming about 35 miles north of the mexican border and 60 miles west of las cruces. thanks to high unemployment, poverty, crime and a horrible public education system, deming has been named no. 1 on a list of the “ten worst places” to live in new mexico. the entire region is considered a high intensity drug trafficking area due to large amounts of meth, heroin, cocaine and marijuana smuggled through the state by mexican traffickers. the brutal juárez and sinaloa cartels operate in that area. the media has swept this under the rug, but it is a severe national security threat. this election may pivot on it, especially if we get hit. our leaders owe it to their constituents to put our safety first, lock down that border and vet these refugees and illegal immigrants. before we lose countless americans to terrorism that is.        alert: police pull over ‘islamic refugee,’ horrified to see what was in the car

__label__1 the liberal media jumped on the story of keith lamont scott, an “unarmed” black man who was shot in cold blood by north carolina police. his only crime was holding a book and waiting to pick up his son from school. what a heartbreaking story. it’s a shame for the liberal narrative that it’s not anything close to the truth. not only did reports conflict with the story of lamont’s girlfriend (a woman also recording the event from about 20 feet away), but new body cam footage released by the police clearly show that scott had an ankle holster and was holding a weapon. this coincides with the officers’ numerous orders for him to drop the gun. this also coincides with scott’s previous convictions for assault with a deadly weapon and carrying a concealed weapon. here’s definitive proof of scott holding the gun, according to a user on twitter: can we put the debate to rest now? pic.twitter.com/aniw2yxwje — quake gyan (@quakedawg) september 26, 2016  and a more detailed analysis of the newest video by political commentator and popular youtuber, mark dice.  it’s clear that the liberal media doesn’t care about what actually happened. it’s clear that they’ll gloss over the fact that he had a gun and previous convictions for assaulting people with concealed weapons. the only thing that matters to them is the justification for rioting and the race-baiting tactics that keeps black people and white people at odds for political gain. it’s disgusting, and america is better than this. share this video everywhere if you think that this was a good shoot and the police were within their rights to protect themselves from a dangerous man. (source: youtube)       yes, keith lamont scott was holding a gun, not a book. here’s the proof.      
__label__1 president obama and black lives matter have consistently over the past year tried to push the narrative that only black people are being unjustly persecuted because of their race. but another video released on the internet debunks that ridiculous notion. a black lives matter thug viciously attacked an innocent an unarmed woman. the footage is quite shocking. last week two young women were savagely attacked in stockton, california after attempting to leave a red robin establishment. cbs local reported that a vigil was being held by protesters to commemorate colby friday. he was an african american man that had been killed by police back in august of this year.  the two girls were caucasian and were walking past the vigil while it occurred. when they were questioned by police they said they believed the attacks were racially motivated. because if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it’s not a pig. assistant district attorney ron freitas told the media that the attack involved several people who were from out of town and that their motivations for attending the protest and for attacking the girls had nothing to do with colby’s death and the protests, indicating that it was racially motivated. a $10,000 reward has been placed for anyone who can provide information that will lead to the capture of these barbarians. this country is a lot less safe with these animals running around. however, unsurprisingly, the mainstream liberal media has ignored this incident and it has gone largely unreported. because of course it does not fit into the narrative of the oppression of african-americans. it makes black lives matter look bad. in fact it makes them look racist! which is the very thing they accuse white people of being. it also makes them the biggest hypocrites known to man. but then again, liberals have the trademark on hypocrisy.       black lives matter thugs do the unthinkable to girl… watch what happens next (video)      
__label__1 colin kaepernick’s refusal to stand for the national anthem has permeated professional and now youth sports. everyone is taking sides and it is not pretty. many feel it is disrespectful to veterans to not stand while others view it as a meaningful protest to bring attention to what they call the oppression of african american people. now a navy sailor came forward via social media to make a statement about the protests that many will not like. the independent journal review reported, “last week, as tensions increased following two highly publicized police shootings, another sailor came forward to say that she would be sitting out the national anthem as well.” read her statement and look at her picture below that she posted to facebook.   she indicates in her little statement that she was punished simply for defending the constitution but that is false. she was punished for violating navy regulations. regulations that she is well aware of. navy regulations indicate that all uniformed personnel must stand at attention towards the ensign when the national anthem is played. it is the military after all. when that regulation is violated then a disciplinary action can be taken. while having the right to do something allows you to that doesn’t mean you are immune from punishment. as is the case here. she had the right to do it, but she was punished because she broke the rules of the pledge she took when she enlisted into the navy. one felbow navyman martin baker noted that in basic training they are taught their duty is to preserve and defend freedom and the constitution not practice it. he is also an african american. while ervin has preserved and defended freedom she is not within her rights to practice it. is that fair? maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. but that is what she signed up for so she shouldn’t be complaining about it now when she knew what she was getting herself into.       another racist navy scumbag refuses to stand and salute american flag while in uniform      
__label__1 president obama prides himself on his legacy for african americans. he often touts his south side of chicago childhoods as some type of rags to riches story. despite the fact that he really grew up all over the world including in the phillipines. you’ll often hear him discussing how his presidency has helped to quell racial tensions. despite the fact that they are at an all time high as seen in baltimore, milwaukee, charlotte, new orleans and more. democrat’s in general have had a very loyal demographic voting base in african americans, women and hispanics. groups of people the party routinely targets during the election. but just because most vote blue doesn’t mean they all do. now some minority citizens are expressing their outrage with president obama and his legacy and spreading it all over twitter. here are a few outraged twitter members, @brownfractals @hillaryclinton i’m insulted by obama more concerned about his damn legacy! what? transgendered toilets? — deplorable latina (@terrymendozer) september 19, 2016  obama’s veto of bill to let 9/11 families sue saudi arabia will cement his legacy https://t.co/p35zkxjv0a via @usheraldnews — roo??

__label__1 what the hell did i just watch? words are really failing me right now… none of what i want to say is going to make any sense to you until you watch this video yourself…so here you go. warning: video might make you want to punch your screen. don’t.  two words popped up in my head while i was watching this video… retarded chihuahua. i don’t even mean that as an insult. purely descriptive wording… boy those liberals love their first amendment right don’t they? this woman went on and on about hers… the problem is…they love it until they disagree with what you’re saying/supporting. then you’re a racist, misogynist, bigot, homophobe, or plug in whatever “phobe” you want here. i’m embarrassed that she’s a woman, that does not reflect any good on us at all. in fact, she is everything wrong with america. she calls the guy a big redneck, doesn’t like what she sees on his lawn then proceeds to flip him off. then makes herself the victim? the woman needs to go slap herself. the real victim is ben…poor poor ben. the kid is doomed! then of course our poor police officers…this is the garbage they are having to deal with everyday now. if i were the guy she flipped off, knowing now that she has to pass the house everyday… i would put out a sign that said… sarah: 0 redneck: 1 i’d pay to watch the video she’d put out after seeing that sign… i really hate social justice warriors, they give me a headache. rude.       video: woman’s tantrum over neighbor’s trump yard signs backfires in her face!      
__label__1 a well known black lives matter activist called police for help when he was the victim of an armed robbery. ironically, he is now called for a larger police presence in the form of intervention and protection in his neighborhood. the man is jerry ford jr. whose a new graduate of the university of houston. he has spent most of his time speaking out against police brutality. but he certainly wasn’t when he called for help.    a firearm ready criminal robbed him right outside of his apartment complex where he lives just a few blocks away from his college campus. now he’s calling on the police and the university as well as other local authorities to increase the level of police in the area. specifically, the area between the campus and the living complex. many students from the school live there. ford said he thought the robber was originally a student. ford stated the man asked if he had a key and he responded that he did and then proceeded to open the door. when he turned around he was staring down the barrel of the gun the criminal was holding. he told the media, “i reach in right here to open the door, and i turn back around and he has the gun right there in my face.” the criminal is also a thief because he stole ford’s cell phone and wallet. he demands now that police patrol the area since local and university police do not. the greatest part is that he claims he is not anti-police he is just anti-bad police. that’s a really good cop out when you need the help of the people you’ve been bashing for years. ford also insists he isn’t just doing this for himself but also for the safety of everyone in his complex including other students. “it’s becoming a pattern. i hope they would take a bigger stance and put more security over here because you have a lot of people walking back and forth to class.” you’ve got to love the liberal logic behind that.       anti-cop black lives activist gets robbed, instantly calls for more police protection      
__label__1 what a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in new jersey and new york city saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. it sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in obama’s america. we’re all aware of the scandal at the veteran’s administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the va had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency. trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. as bizpacreview reported: “we have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) rahami. “thank you, law enforcement. thank you, police.” then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “but the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. he will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said trump. “he will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. and he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. and on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.” watch below:  wouldn’t it be nice if our veterans received the same treatment? instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the va. there are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in va parking lots.  we can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield? i can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless americans due to his religious ideology. admittedly, i think i’d be tempted to make a medical “error” or two.       disgusting! because of hillary & obama, ny terrorist will get better treatment than us vets!      
__label__1 i’ve pretty much decided to boycott the nfl. there are some great players and coaches there, but until commissioner goodell gets his head out of his butt and puts a stop to dissing the national anthem, the military and the police, i want nothing to do with them. if you love your country, i would hope you love it more than the nfl and football or any other sport… what these whining, wealthy athletes are doing is not only unpatriotic, it is racist and incendiary in nature. they are spoiling for a race war. three philadelphia eagles players raised their fists in the sign for black power at their game in chicago on monday night during the national anthem. it was disgraceful and i think i’ve had just about enough of this crap. ever since colin kaepernick started this cop-hating gesture by sitting and then kneeling during the national anthem, it has had me furious. i’ve seen it spread to colleges and high schools. i’ve seen it infect other sports as well. it should not be tolerated by these teams… it’s just that simple. it doesn’t help that barack and michelle obama have done it as well… it is a radical, racist gesture and unacceptable. i accept it no more than i would accept a nazi salute – they are both disgusting and hateful. even sports illustrated has bowed to black lives matter. from gateway pundit: it’s an obama world. last week nfl players were sitting during the national anthem. now they’re raising the black power fist. on monday four eagles players raised the black power fist during the national anthem.   malcolm jenkins and few teammates with fists in air during national anthem. #eagles pic.twitter.com/llw8zoyuun — john clark csn (@jclarkcsn) september 20, 2016    eagles defensive end steven means, strong safety malcolm jenkins and defensive back ron brooks all raised their fists. the rest of the eagles, and all players on the bears, stood at attention. the players who did the radical salute should all be shunned for this behavior and they should be ashamed of themselves. especially since just days ago a black man ambushed a female police officer in her patrol car in philadelphia, shooting her eight times. her vest saved her, but the guy shot five others, killing one, before he was brought down. doing the black power salute only makes all of that worse and inflames racial and police tensions even more. these players live in the freest country in the world, where they have made millions and live privileged lifestyles. yet they hate america, her military and the police who protect their sorry asses. obama took a colorblind society and turned it into a race war waiting to happen. now, everything is about race and you have black lives matter, the new black panthers and the nation of islam getting away with racial incitement and violence threatened and realized. these players deserve far more than a boycott. they deserve to be banned from their sports over this. there should be consequences for stoking the fires of racial animosity and the hatred of american heroes.        wow: eagles players raise racist black power fist during national anthem, hate our vets      
__label__1 judge jeanine pirro has been outspoken against hillary clinton for some time, but never more so when the infamous “deplorable” comment was mentioned by ol’ hillary. in pirro’s most recent opening statement, she absolutely unloaded on clinton, and it’s one you’re going to want to play on repeat. “this week, hillary’s all better, and she and her surrogates call on all americans—all but us ‘deplorables’—to stand up and repudiate donald trump’s divisive rhetoric—through their own divisive rhetoric!” pirro said in her opening statement. “hillary is so desperate for the black vote that she insists on creating race issues,” she said, playing a clip of clinton last week accusing trump of “describ[ing] the black community in such insulting and ignorant terms.” “isn’t donald trump speaking to the problems of the minority communities in inner cities? maybe your recent health issues have prevented you from grasping the reality of inner city crime,” pirro said, adding that her criticisms of trump could easily be an indictment of her own actions. “you choose to create division—you look for a target: the police, donald trump, a common enemy. then you promise the world and you have the gall to actually say “imagine someone who distorts the truth to fit a very narrow view of the world…who sees someone who doesn’t look like him and agree with him, and thinks that person must not be a real america.” “this is exactly what you said when you called us ‘deplorable’,” pirro said. “i know you have double-vision and memory problems—documented by the fbi—but your hypocrisy is stunning. you’re the ‘hater’. you’re the one who said ‘we are above all that’.”  hillary clinton is the one that’s calling racism when it’s the democrats, proven by the dnc email leak, who are the true racists. they preach tolerance and equality, but they utilize that platform to keep minority populations at bay and not let them thrive. it’s absolutely appalling and we shouldn’t stand for it. this is just another nail in the political coffin for clinton. soon she’ll be gone from our minds and trump will be president. you can make that happen this november.

__label__1 speculation about hillary clinton’s health continues to grow after her 9/11 fainting and overheating spell that forced her to leave a remembrance service early. she has released some medical records on wednesday as rumors persisted. however, most people still don’t believe what she has to say. the released records have caused even more speculation and wonder especially over clinton’s lack of transparency. dr. lisa bardack released a letter that showed clinton actually had surgery in january because of a severe sinus infection. but clinton never revealed this to the public. doctors put a drain in clinton’s ear in order to clear the fluid that came as a result of her infection. apparently it made her better. people have intimidated that she likely had a myringotomy. a ct scan in march showed that she had healed up well. bardack wrote in her report, “this scan showed no abnormalities of the brain and mild chronic sinusitis. the symptoms resolved and she continued symptom-free for the next six months.” while a sinus infection certainly is nothing to serious the major problem people have is with her dishonesty. why keep it a secret? why be dishonest? why lack transparency? read the full transcript here.   clinton’ campaign has a notable and widely publicized issue with transparency and honesty. she is well aware of the fact that many people think this about her and question the veracity of her healthy status. thus, to be dishonest through a lie of omission seems simply stupid. clinton is many things but stupid isn’t one of them. so why the lies? the public had a right to know about the health of the people running for the highest office in the land. it’s a perfectly reasonable line of questioning. to brush it off as a conspiracy theory is wrong, which clinton has done. and it further shows people they have something to be concerned about.       breaking: “bombshell revelation” — hillary had secret surgery this year      
__label__1 one of the biggest problems in arming the so-called “moderate” syrian rebels to fight isis is that we truly don’t know who the moderates are. just think of post cases where we’ve armed insurgents, such as the mujahideen during the cold war to fight the russians – only to have many of them later morph into al-qaeda and the taliban.  the same is true of the so-called moderates in syria. a video went viral last month of one such “moderate” group of rebels beheading a 12 year old boy, which i won’t link to for obvious reasons – and how many other groups have members who would do the same? most of the dozens of groups fighting in the syrian civil war have some sort of ideological motivation, and even “moderate” muslims could change their tune when they have the power to influence government. it’s too late now though, as the house voted to arm syrian rebels back in 2014, and john mccain was a huge proponent of it. and how is that working out? let’s take a peak… as weaselzippers reported: video footage appears to show us commandos fleeing a syrian town under a barrage of abuse and insults hurled at them by fighters from the american-backed free syrian army (fsa) rebel group. the video appears to be the first evidence of us special forces cooperating with turkish troops in their battle against islamic state (isil). the incident illustrates the complex web of alliances and enmities in syria, where many of america’s allies are fighting each other and some rebel groups that receive us support still harbour strong anti-american sentiments. the footage shows a crowd of rebel fighters in the town of al-rai near the turkish border, which was captured from isil by syrian rebel groups with the backing of turkey. turkey, which launched a military incursion into syria in late august, has been backing the fsa. the fighters scream anti-american chants as a column of pick-up trucks carrying us commandos drives away from them. “christians and americans have no place among us,” shouts one man in the video. “they want to wage a crusader war to occupy syria.” another man calls out: “the collaborators of america are dogs and pigs. they wage a crusader war against syria and islam. ” the us troops are not wearing traditional uniform but they carry american weapons and are wearing the distinctive round helmets favoured by us special forces. two days ago, the u.s. admitted that we may have possibly accidentally bombed syrian forces in an airstrike that was meant for isis. however, when syrian forces (who are supposed to be our allies) are threatening us, could that strike have been intentional, and we just claimed it was meant for isis as cover up? just when you thought the syrian civil war couldn’t get even more complicated, it did.       video: obama-backed “moderate” syrian rebels threaten to kill american special forces      
__label__1 weirdest thing, united states immigration made a mistake. just kidding it’s not weird, in fact they just caught themselves making 858 mistakes when they mistakenly granted citizenship to immigrants who had pending deportation orders from countries of concern to national security or with high rates of immigration fraud. oopsie. don’t worry government everyone makes mistakes and it’s only our national security at risk!!!!! i mean c’mon guys, this isn’t like accidentally leaving the onion on a burger when the customer says ‘hold the onion’. a human being and their paperwork is much larger than a burger. homeland security department’s inspector general found that these particular immigrants used different names and birthdates and their fingerprints were missing from the database. the report does not identify any of the immigrants by name, but inspector general john roth’s auditors said they were all from “special interest countries” — those that present a national security concern for the united states — or neighboring countries with high rates of immigration fraud. the report did not identify those countries. dhs officials identified an additional 953 people who had been naturalized despite outstanding deportation orders, though auditors couldn’t determine if those immigrants had digital fingerprints on file or not. roth’s report said fingerprints are missing from federal databases for as many as 315,000 immigrants with final deportation orders or who are fugitive criminals. immigration and customs enforcement has not reviewed about 148,000 of those immigrants’ files to add fingerprints to the digital record. the biggest danger in mistakenly awarding citizenship to someone who should be deported is that as a us citizen they would be able to apply for jobs that require security clearance. so far 3 of these mistaken ‘citizens’ acquired aviation and transportation credentials. a 4th person had become a law enforcement officer. for now immigration and dhs are scrambling to fill the holes in the files and implement a system to evaluate each case of the immigrants improperly granted citizenship.       800 immigrants set to be deported for national security concerns ‘mistakenly’ granted citizenship      
__label__1 jason falconer, the nra-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the isis terrorist who stabbed eight people in st. cloud, minnesota, is someone that hillary clinton wants to put out of business. in fact, it’s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president. this is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a jihadist. the same kind of islamic refugee that barack obama and hillary clinton just love to death. falconer owns tactical advantage firearms training, inc. which is one of those businesses that clinton just despises… because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our second amendment rights. this is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for hillary clinton… ever. from bearing arms: we told you this morning how uspsa shooter, 3-gunner, and nra-certified firearms instructor jason falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a st. cloud, (mn) mall on saturday, saving countless lives. what we didn’t tell you is that hillary clinton wants to bankrupt falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. falconer is the president and owner of tactical advantage, llc and tactical advantage firearms training, inc. his business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). if elected president, hillary clinton will do everything in her power to see jason falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy. falconer’s tactical advantage, lcc, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. it is american as apple pie and one that i love. the 2005 protection of lawful commerce in arms act (plcaa) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as falconer’s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. clinton wants to do away with plcaa, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare. clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that plcaa offers gunmakers and dealers “immunity.” it’s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage clinton. she hates the second amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. she is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation. jason falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. hillary clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. the fact that he took down an islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more. just say no to hillary clinton, so heroes like falconer are celebrated, not punished.        despicable! hillary wants to put hero cop who stopped mall terror attack out of business      
__label__1 incredible. democrat asks a question, republican has an answer, a powerful answer. democrat proceeds to get mad, and uses interruption and deceiving chain of words and emotions to keep the powerful answer from being heard. not only is that terribly embarrassing…but the democrat just ends up looking like a total asshat. in this case…it seems like randy perkins (said democrat) needs some serious ‘anger management’ therapy. i mean, the man went from 0 to 100 in 10 seconds flat! on a topic he couldn’t digest himself…but was the very person to bring it to the plate! classic dem… randy “hot head” perkins is running for congress in florida’s 18th district. enter former u.s. army special operations soldier sgt. brian mast, who is his republican opponent. mast has served under the joint special operation command as an explosives, ordinance and demolition bomb technician. basically, he risks his life going one on one with actual bombs, before they detonate and wipe life out…and so much more. in 2010, as he was conducting an operation in afghanistan, mast found himself once more coming face to face with an improvised explosive device (ied) that didn’t go down without taking a part of mast with it. he lost both his legs and suffered great injury to his left arm, and still went on to volunteer and serve with the israeli defense forces in israel. this is the man that you are about to watch on video being unfairly attacked by randy “hot head” perkins. keep that in mind as you watch the interaction or lack thereof between the two. did you see that? perkins gave nothing but absolute disregard and disrespect to mast in a situation that he himself, had set up. that’s enough to make you want to reach right into your computer screen and slap that guy. of course mast is qualified, and perkins just helped to prove it. when has anger ever been the method of problem solving? anger is a good method to get the motivation to problem solve…but is absolutely destructive to use while fixing what needs to be fixed. who in their right mind wants a man like perkins in charge? he’s just proven himself to be an ogre! while at the sametime showing people that mast is level headed, and calm in situations that most people would start swinging fists… mast is qualified because he has proven he is willing to sacrifice for america and americans. a great leader possesses values of integrity, accountability, and the ability to keep a good sense of humor, even in troubled times. i’d say mast just gave a good example of that, thanks to perkins. he kept cool, and even showed he had good sense of humor when he chuckled a little in disbelief. he made his claims and was asked to prove why they were true, and took no hesitation in doing so, despite perkins changing the angle every 2 seconds to throw him off. heck, earlier we wanted to slap perkins…but maybe we should be thanking him for burying himself? look, it’s not too hard to divide the good men from the bad when they make it so obvious themselves. however, as further witness of mast’s good character, you should know that freedom daily met with him at cpac this year. as expected he is a very humble and down to earth guy, even after all the horrors he has witnessed on the battlefield where he has given up his quality of life for you, me and our children. we assure you, this attack that perkins unleashed on mast… is absolutely uncalled for.       disgusting! arrogant dem candidate tells double amputee vet opponent, “you aren’t qualified!”      
__label__1 i don’t recall in any presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. not only is hillary clinton’s health constantly making headline, but it’s also commonly a part of presidential polls. the polls continue to show a hillary decline as hillary continues to show a health decline.  here are the top takeaways from the poll: •more than 40% of registered voters now believe that clinton is in either “below average” or “very poor” health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between september 12 and 13. that’s a sharp departure from another morning consult poll taken just at the end of august, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar. •the share of voters who think clinton’s health is “average” remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. by contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think trump is in either “above average” or “excellent” health actually ticked upwards from late august, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of clinton). •voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about clinton’s potential medical issues. while hillary clinton is only 68 years-old, she’s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. my mom is in her 60’s too but looks 20 years younger than hillary, at least. usually ‘looking old’ or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. i can’t see hillary as a hard drug user but lately i have grown suspicious of hillary’s health. the suspicion isn’t from one particular thing, it’s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press. at one point it was reported that hillary was taking coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady’s. it was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from parkinson’s, alzheimer’s, and multiple sclerosis. even her assistant huma abedin was caught talking about hillary getting ‘confused and needing naps’, of which she was probably severely punished. and then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. recently, another damning picture came out with hillary unable to get up stairs alone. while this picture alone wouldn’t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way. another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs. then there are pictures like this where hillary is literally being held up while talking. it would be more rare to find a picture of hillary not holding onto someone’s arm. here’s an interesting video on how the video of hillary passing out at the 9/11 memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. it is obvious that hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. if you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. i believe that the events are purposely not being promoted so that her voter don’t see her in person because she looks awful. and of course the coughing pictures, america has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. she might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the us, ever. not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she’s gasping for air. it’s incredibly alarming to have such a sickly candidate because she could be the next *cough cough hmhmm uck khoff khak khak gack — *gasp excuse me, president of the united states.        unfit! look what hillary needed to get up the stairs at her rally today!

__label__1 as cities are burned in wake of yet another “peaceful protest” involving uninformed public that don’t wait for the facts, it should come as no surprise to anyone that when the facts are released, a different story resents itself altogether. terence crutcher was a black man shot by police earlier this week. immediately the media portrayed it as “unarmed black man shot by racist white cop.” however, when more details came out, it’s clear that the media did its best to bury the story and glom onto the newest “victim” of the media’s outrage machine. here’s the truth of what happened, and it’s every black lives matter supporter’s worst nightmare. not only did crutcher not have his hands raised, but it appears that the officer’s account of him reaching in the car was justified, as well as the bombshell that pcp was found in his car, with the jury out on if it was in his system. if it was, that lends credence to the officer’s story, making him incredibly hard to subdue. according to bearing arms, numerous media organizations that should know better, from sky news, to reuters, to npr, are claiming that white tulsa (ok) police department officer betty shelby shot and killed terence crutcher standing in the road with his hands up. that is a demonstrable lie, as proven with simple screen captures from video footage from the police helicopter circling overhead.  in the photo above, crutcher, wearing a white shirt and tan pants, can be seen walking away from officer betty shelby. his hands are clearly raised… at this precise moment.  unfortunately for all concerned, crutcher does not obey lawful commands to freeze, and walks back to his vehicle.  as shown above, crutcher walks to the driver’s side door, and his right hand is still clearly raised. his left hand is still up as well, but blends into the dark color of the windows.  as mr. crutcher squares up with the driver’s side door of his vehicle straddling the centerline of the road, his hands are still raised. but they don’t stay there.  as the helicopter continues in a counterclockwise turn, mr. crutcher clearly drops his hands to his side.  as we can see above, mr. crutcher’s right hand has dropped and is just in front of his waist. his left hand still appears to be up and positioned near the upper door frame or “a” pillar.  at the moment just before mr. crutcher simultaneously shot once by officer shelby (right) and tased by officer tyler turnbough (left), mr. crutcher’s hand is clearly down near his waist near the right front pants pocket area. this is when both officers decided to discharge respective weapons.  the image above is just after mr. crutcher was simultaneously shot once in the chest and tased.  in the image directly above, mr. crutcher has just been shot, and the wound to his chest is just starting to bleed. throught the hole. mr. crutcher will begin bleeding much more profusely within fractions of a second, then roughly 2 seconds later, he will collapse to the ground. here’s the video. watch it for yourself. * * * without passing any judgments one way or the other on whether mr. crutcher’s actions warranted the shot fired by officer shelby, one thing is 100% clear, and that is that terence crutcher’s hands were not raise when he was shot, but down by his side. the mainstream media is, universally and without question, lying to you about the circumstances of terence crutcher’s shooting. read more here…       no, terence crutcher did not have his hands up when he was shot by police      
__label__1 america continues to be rocked by racial unrest and division, as the shooting of a black man in charlotte, north carolina sends folks into a frenzy of rioting and violence. keith lamont scott was shot and killed by police yesterday, an incident about which race hustlers wasted no time in jumping to conclusions — and pushing narratives — particularly after the man’s daughter posted a video ranting that her father was disabled and unarmed. police chief kerr putney and his officers have a bit of a different take on the situation, however. they’ve just revealed the man was armed. furthermore, chief putney says police gave him several warnings to drop the gun, which he refused to do. according to theblaze, charlotte-mecklenburg police chief kerr putney said during a news conference wednesday morning that officers were searching for a suspect tuesday when they saw 43-year-old keith lamont scott exit a vehicle with a handgun. he says the officers told him to drop the gun and that he got out of the vehicle a second time still carrying the gun. he says the man was shot because he posed a threat. charlotte police chief: officers gave loud, clear commands before shooting https://t.co/jzpnofswvc #keithlamontscott https://t.co/upzqj5qzwo — cnn (@cnn) september 21, 2016  “it’s time to change the narrative, because i can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,” he said. his comments were an apparent reference to a profanity-laced, hourlong video that a woman claiming to be scott’s daughter posted to facebook soon after the shooting, saying that her father had an unspecified disability and was unarmed. in it, she appears to be at the shooting scene, which is surrounded by yellow police tape, as she yells at officers. the woman did not respond to facebook messages, and her claims could not immediately be verified by the associated press. it also was not clear if she witnessed the shooting. as of now, the facts surrounding this case are still coming in, so it’s difficult to make a final judgment on the whole situation. if scott was indeed armed and refused to comply with police officers, then those on the scene had no choice but to use force to neutralize the threat posed by the suspect. what’s unfortunate is that so many folks in charlotte — and across the nation — have jumped to conclusions, buying into the narrative that police officers are somehow a corrupt institution looking for new and creative ways to exterminate blacks. our nation is in desperate need of healing along racial lines, but this will never happen as long as folks believe a false narrative they’re being spoon fed by liberals who want nothing more than to keep minorities enslaved to the democratic party.

__label__1 president obama just made his last address as a sitting president to the united nations general assembly. in his speech he stressed about the necessity of international law and order. he told the assembly of 140 different countries that the united states would have to give up some of our freedoms. yup, you read that right. he passive aggressively made attacks against those who oppose a lenient form of refugee resettlement. as well, he noted that one of the worlds greatest problems being dealt with is when, “powerful nations contest the constraints placed on them by international law. we can press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration, or we can retreat… along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion.” several times he references global integration as well as noting that liberal societies show discrimination and intolerance when women choose to cover themselves. an obvious reference to the burkini ban in france. obama said, “and in europe and the united states, you see people wrestle with concerns about immigration and changing demographics, and suggesting that somehow people who look different are corrupting the character of our countries.” the absolute worse part was then he said that america would likely have to accept more constraints, and deprive themselves of freedoms by binding ourselves to international rules. specifically, he said, “we have to put our money where our mouths are. and we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations like my own accept constraints. sometimes i’m criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions, but i’m convinced in the long run giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests but binding ourselves to international rules, over the long-term, enhances our security.” watch his speech here,  this progressive politicians tune has not changed one bit. when in fact all the things he is criticizing about anti refugee sentiment are things that americans and other europeans actually believe and feel. yet, he dismisses it. he and his administration are the only ones who feel this way. this way being a liberal narrative. the narrative being that islam is a peaceful religion, jihadism does not represent islam, more refugees should be allowed into the united states with less vetting, and that incoming refugees don’t deteriorate a countries culture. these are all true yet he dismisses it like it is completely false. just because he and his administration don’t admit the truth to themselves does not mean the rest of us have to remain in the dark. he is an embarrassment of this country and is destroying the hegemonic presence the united states has in the global arena. he’s too passive. everyone knows they can take advantage and walk all over us.       obama: u.s. must give up freedoms, submit to international rule – watch

__label__1 republican gov. greg abbott is a stud. he knows how to govern which is not something i can say for the potus (president of the united states). gov. abbott, representing texas, informed the office of refugee resettlement that they would be withdrawing from the program on jan. 31, 2017. this past weekend there were several terrorist attacks in the united states (of which obama has yet to have any decent response) that have given pause to any thinking leader in our nation to allow muslim refugees into their state. the biggest issue for gov. abbott is that obama hasn’t been able to ensure the states that the refugees being sent are not terrorists or do not pose a terror threat. he had his texas administration draft a plan that would require federal national security officials to provide assurances that none of the individuals being resettled pose a terror threat. “the federal government’s refugee settlement program is riddled with serious problems that pose a threat to our nation,” the governor said in a statement. “the director of the federal bureau of investigation and the director of national intelligence have repeatedly declared their inability to fully screen refugees from terrorist-based nations. even with the inability to properly vet refugees from syria and countries known to be supporters or propagators of terrorism, president obama is now ineptly proposing a dramatic increase in the number of refugees to be resettled in the u.s.” “while many refugees pose no danger, some pose grave danger, like the iraqi refugee with ties to isis who was arrested earlier this year after he plotted to set off bombs at two malls in houston,” abbott said. “despite multiple requests by the state of texas, the federal government lacks the capability or the will to distinguish the dangerous from the harmless, and texas will not be an accomplice to such dereliction of duty to the american people,” he added. “therefore, texas will withdraw from the refugee resettlement program. i strongly urge the federal government to completely overhaul a broken and flawed refugee program that increasingly risks american lives.” can you blame a governor whose main goal is to protect his constituents? i’m pretty sure liberals think he is evil and will paint him to be a villain, racist who selfishly refuses to share his resources with poor refugees with nowhere else to turn. but the thing he’s not willing to share are the lives of women and children sitting in a shopping mall drinking an orange julius unprepared for a suicide bomber to sit at the table next to them. this is america, let’s keep it that way. if other countries want their citizens to live in terror, it is their right. it is also our right to implement strategies of security.       texas just gave obama the finger over refugee program and it’s awesome!      
__label__1 i…can’t…even. this is absolute madness and as hard as i’m trying to process this nonsense in my head, i just can’t wrap my brain around it. i have no doubt that things are about to get really messy. i cannot say that i don’t understand the judge after reading the report. there are some black americans that have a legit fear of police officers and their first instinct is to run. it’s just… is this really the only way to remedy that? there are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them. it’s going to blow up in his face. in massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. this ruling came from supreme court, therefore… it stands as is without appeal. the problem is, are the citizens of ma now in more danger because of it? you be the judge of that. the job of a police officer is a whole other level of “all things dangerous” then any civilian could ever imagine. they are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. it’s not possible. you can only live that life, to understand that life. that fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair. as if their job wasn’t already hard enough in obama’s america, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of massachusetts. if they feel that they are being “disproportionately” targeted, they can run. yes, run from the police officer, who now can do nothing about it. to add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either. up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that’s “reasonable suspicion” and used as reason for a police officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. now, it’s not important to get evidence when it’s fresh, because it could hurt a thug’s feelings. basically, police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve…if there’s a runner. which…let’s be real, what thug doesn’t run? punchline: the law abiding ones! i’m so funny. you’re welcome.       no way! liberal judge just made a law for black males to do this disgusting thing to cops

__label__1 hollywood legend clint eastwood endorsed republican presidential nominee donald trump while also expressing his lack of excitement for democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton. he is after all a well known hollywood conservative which is hard to come by.   the actor said donald trump is, “on to something because secretly everybody’s getting tired of political correctness, kissing up. that’s the kiss-ass generation we’re in right now. we’re really in a p***y generation. everybody’s walking on eggshells. we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff.” he went on, “when i grew up, those things weren’t called racist,” he continued. “and then when i did ‘gran torino’ even my associate said, ‘this is a really good script, but it’s politically incorrect.’ and i said, ‘good. let me read it tonight.’ the next morning, i came in and i threw it on his desk and i said, ‘we’re starting this immediately.’” well tell us how you really feel clint! it appears that perhaps, if even in the least bit, that clint eastwood and donald trump have something in common. they certainly have no filter. eastwood did say in his statement that he believes donald trump occasionally steps out of line. specifically trump’s comments about a mexican judge being unfit to do his job because trump made derogatory comments about mexican’s and he felt the judge would be prejudiced as a result. but he brushes it off as saying that trump is simply stating what is on his mind. the icon himself gave some advice for the future that he thinks could potentially make a difference, “i’d say get to work and start being more understanding of everybody—instead of calling everybody names, start being more understanding. but get in there and get it done. kick ass and take names. and this may be my dad talking, but don’t spend what you don’t have. that’s why we’re in the position we are in right now. that’s why people are saying, ‘why should i work? i’ll get something for nothing, maybe.’” he has made headlines over some of his comments about the republican nominee. when people called donald trump racist he proclaimed that people just needed to get over it already. he made sure to add a curse word in their for effect. one of his biggest criticisms of hillary clinton is her willingness to remain in the status quo which he detests. which honestly is not entirely inaccurate. eastwood’s political sentiments are contrasted by the majority of hollywood. hollywood is known for being made up predominantly of progressive liberals. you cannot find an actor who is unwilling to use their status, power, fame and money to advance their liberal agenda and causes. eastwood is one of the few a list celebrities who is conservative. most others are barely known and don’t do tell well after expressing their conservative sentiments. just look at mel gibson and stacey dash. it is always nice to hear an a lister speak their conservative opinions. because they are one of the hollywood elite. thus, they cannot be scoffed at as easily and dismissed. certainly not the man, the myth, the legend, clint eastwood.       clint eastwood had enough, blows up on hillary and obama… liberals are furious      
__label__1 german chancellor angela merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. she is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. merkel told the media at a press conference, “if i knew what change in refugee policy the people in germany want, i would be prepared to consider it.” these comments came shortly after the defeat of the christian democratic union in berlin’s sunday elections. she also said, “if i could, i would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.” she took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the mecklenburg-vorpommern election. callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader. the results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many germans now have. as well as the rise of the anti mass migration alternative for germany known as afd. these factors have forced merkel to at least consider a change in her stance. regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. in other words it is all talk and no walk. she is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want. however, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the christian social union. they have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into germany each year. they specifically want to cap it at 200,000. as well, they want to prioritize christian migrants over muslims. but merkle will not budge on that. merkel stated, “if people don’t want muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to germany’s. the cdu and i cannot go along with that.” christian social union party leader horst seehofer threatened to withdraw support for merkle during her 2017 campaign. specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. the campaign will be in the federal election. he said, “it is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.” the growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. understandably so. if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. this could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. or at least win by an only marginal amount. serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as president obama’s and hillary clinton’s. she is no different which is why many americans too cannot stand her.       boom! merkel admits flooding germany with muslim refugees was wrong      
__label__1 muslim somali asylum seeker, abdullah, in sundsvall, sweden is a bastard! abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. this aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to sweden 5 years ago. his most recent crime wasn’t to any stranger this time it was to his wife. he had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting must be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it. the story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his muslim right to punish his pregnant wife for her disobedience comes into play. he forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. he then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. that is strange to me since muslims aren’t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, i wonder why it was there in the first place. he then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine. thank you mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‘disobedient’ woman. especially when pregnant. quran 4:34 — so righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what allah would have them guard. but those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. but if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. indeed, allah is ever exalted and grand. just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of “beat them,” the islamic prophet muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest. i wonder where it says you can pick and choose which edicts from the quran and hadith you want to obey? this guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. i believe the quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but i guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times or someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for muslims which he is following.       sick! muslim refugee beats, urinates on pregnant woman after seeing what she has      
__label__1 it’s been said that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun, but in the case of the minnesota mall attacker, to quote another cliche, he brought a knife to a gun fight. last saturday set the bar for the poorest execution of a terrorist attack to date. five explosives were planted around the tri-state area, killing nobody. one bomb was supposed to detonate during a 5k race for veterans – but detonated before the race even began. another explosive went off in nyc that night, but despite injuries, nobody was killed.  also occurring on saturday was a machete attack in a mall in minnesota. nine were injured during the attacks, where the attacker was shouting “allah akbar” during (but the media still thought there was a debate over the motives for the attack). eventually he was shot numerous times and killed. the man who killed him was an off-duty police officer, an instructor of a concealed carry class, and a competitive shooter. in other words, a good guy with a gun that even allah couldn’t save him from. for the first time since the incident, he’s speaking out. as abc news reported: the off-duty police officer who shot and killed the knife-wielding minnesota mall attacker said he is staying out of the spotlight until the investigation is over but is grateful for all the messages of support he has received. jason falconer, who has been hailed a hero by many americans, including the president, went right back to work after bravely intervening in saturday’s stabbing attack at the crossroads center mall in st. cloud, minnesota, according to local abc news affiliate kstp-tv. dahir ahmed adan, 20, began stabbing people at the shopping center; 10 suffered injuries. none of the injuries are life-threatening, authorities said. falconer shot adan dead, and authorities believe his quick action saved lives. falconer spoke to kstp-tv at tactical advantage, a firearms shop where he is an employee. he said he was at the mall on saturday “buying his son’s birthday present,” which he was able to take home, despite the horrific scene that unfolded. falconer said he shot at adan “to stop the threat.” countless others were spared from being hacked, potentially to death, thanks to falconer’s actions. japanese marshal admiral and the commander-in-chief of the combined fleet during world war ii isoroku yamamoto once famously stated that you can’t invade mainland america, “because there would be a rifle behind every blade of glass.” unlike our neighbors across the sea in europe, we’re armed to the teeth, and any jihadi who tries to wreck havok is in for one hell of a surprise.       unassuming hero in the minnesota mall attack speaks out – watch      
__label__1 warning, muslims, if you want to chant “allah” over and over on a plane, there might be repercussions! faisal ali and his wife, nazia had boarded a cincinnati bound delta air lines flight in paris, france. the plane sat on the tarmac for about 45 minutes. during that time, several flight attendants noticed that the husband was sweating, hiding his phone, and that both he and his wife were chanting “allah” repeatedly. it made the flight attendants uncomfortable, reports the independent uk. one of the flight crew (after having cleared it with the captain) approached the couple, and told them to gather their belongings as they would have to exit the plane over “safety” concerns. faisal’s wife, nazia, can be seen in this cell phone video becoming combative, asking if it’s about “discrimination.”  a person who appears to be the captain tells nazia that it’s a “safety of flight issue.” mad world news reports that, when the alis exited, a french police officer was waiting for them outside the gate and an airline worker was carefully reviewing their passports. the couple went through a brief interrogation process and they were okayed for release. it was then that the delta employee explained that the pilot had made the decision to kick them off the flight because crew members noticed their particularly strange behavior and felt “uncomfortable.” the couple was promptly booked on another flight and sent home and has now offered them a refund as a gesture of good will. of course, this wasn’t enough to satisfy their entitlement. the inconvenience caused by their unconventional behavior was seen by them as being nothing less than a case of “islamophobia.” so, the couple immediately called the terror-tied, saudi-funded council on american-islamic relations to whine about their alleged persecution. cair is accusing the airline of repeated profiling of muslim passengers, and, if this is true, delta is probably one of the safest airlines to fly. because france is suffering from a constant barrage of islamic terrorist attacks, they are taking measures to prevent muslims from killing their citizens. personally, i applaud the flight attendants and the captain. muslims can scream “discrimination!” all they want. if you’re acting suspicious, you will be removed from a flight, especially with all of the terror attacks that have been happening as of late. the flight crew was acting out of fear for their, and their passenger’s safety. imagine if the couple were terrorists. they could’ve taken the plane down, killing hundreds on board. safety first, as they say. the hell with your feelings about being “discriminated” against. people want to live, and not be attacked by terrorist scum.  did the flight crew make the right decision? share if you think they did! by jeff rainforth like jeff on facebook follow jeff on twitter       u.s. muslims flaunt “allah” on plane, flight attendant has brilliant response      
__label__1 well tell us how you really feel. normally when a muslim bashes the usa, you wouldn’t think that they’re an american themselves. such wasn’t the case when it came to american olympian fencer ibtihaj muhammad,who became the first american to compete in an olympic games wearing a hijab. as it turns out, she has some nasty things to say about the country she’s representing. according to her, as quoted by the federalist papers: [i feel unsafe] all the time. i had someone follow me home from practice and try to report me to police. and this is right on 28th and 7th in new york city… i want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don’t come even close to things we’ve seen like the shooting in north carolina or the rhetoric around the khan family at the dnc. it’s ridiculous and we as a country have to change and i feel like this is our moment.” how terrible – but let’s not pretend that we live in an “islamophobic” country when the number of hate crimes against jews is a multiple of those against muslims.  if she thinks america is so terrible, why doesn’t she move to a muslim country? i think we all know the answer – because no where else in the world do muslims have it as good as they do in america. she’s not going to be stoned to death in america. she’s not going to have her genitals mutilated in america. she’s not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in america. she’s not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in america. when that’s what she faces if she were to live in a muslim country, i think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling.       female muslim-american olympian bashes u.s.a. —goes off the hinges about why america sucks!      
__label__1 charlotte riots have gone mad. the idiots there turned a “peaceful protest” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun. go figure. they can’t even play the race card on this one, but they’ll still wreck a town for no reason. it makes sense now that the thugs in charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. what did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted? nothing. but thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police. ding ding! the looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. why? because another black man was an idiot who didn’t listen to police. that must mean it’s time for the charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. these thugs are such losers that they assaulted a cnn reporter. the charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don’t even know cnn is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every black lives matter thug.  madworld news – rioters swarmed this man’s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. while they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. it’s okay with the blm for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. this proves that they don’t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn’t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed. if i saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then i’d probably pick them up. i know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they’d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up. black lives matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. they’re the extremely violent thugs of america who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses. black lives matter supporters are the worst people of america. they’re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. they call white people racist just because they’re white. they attack people just because they’re white. they call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. how is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? they can’t. but as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions. i judge black lives matter thugs and supporters on their actions and not the color of their skin. based off what i’ve seen so far, i can proudly say f*ck black lives matter and the hoopty they drove in on.       charlotte thugs leaves cop’s body with disgusting thing they did…      
__label__1 here we go again. cop shoots thug, black lives matter morons riot, cause mass destruction, and cause harm to businesses and people. this is the world we live in, folks,and it’s happening in front of our very eyes…again. and nowhere to be found is our do-nothing president who consistently sides with all the rioters. he couldn’t care less as his racially charged agenda is to divide the us so much that we’re sent back to the civil right movement. or so it would seem. new gingrich just called out blm and obama for this decay of race relations. it’s put square on their shoulders and we agree with him! watch below.  “fifty-three years after martin luther king’s ‘i have a dream’ speech; eight years after the election of an african-american president…race relations are decaying in this country.” “schools that don’t work, neighborhoods with no jobs, random violence, a sense of being powerless even though there is an african-american president,” gingrich said. but there’s another problem here. whenever there is a riot, obama speaks out in favor of blm saying that we need to reform our police and they need to take more responsibility for their actions. however, when countless thousands are killed in inner city black on black crime across the country, specifically in chicago, obama’s hometown, he doesn’t bat an eye. because it doesn’t fit his agenda. he lamented the fact that major democratic leaders have not intently reacted to repeated events of anti-police protests and urban violence. “over 3,000 people shot in chicago…but no national reaction: obama doesn’t notice it, clinton doesn’t notice it.” “the country at large will not tolerate this kind of random violence. people will not tolerate looting…closing interstate 85– burning things.” what we need is someone who can restore order to things. this must end. police must be vigilant and arrest anyone who riots. we need a president who can stop all this, not obama who only ads fuel to the quite literal fires. read more here…       newt’s response to the charlotte riots is black lives matter’s worst nightmare      
__label__1 maybe clinton was actually thinking of mark cuban, her guest “star” for her debate against trump. here is a video of cuban explaining racism. actually he ends up showcasing his own racism.  liberals talk of tolerance and not seeing color, as they showcase their intolerance and ability to see “black” quite easily. as a conservative and republican, i live in the real world, where i deal with statistics. the math around black teen criminality would make me a fool not to cross the street when i see black teens. liberals suspend reality, because they must in order to rationalize their nonsense. however, in suspending reality, they are not allowed to then take the “conservative” position of facts, logic, and reason…when convenient. that is why mark cuban is a racist. but it may be worse. apparently cuban is a bit of a sexist. .@hillaryclinton surrogate, @mcuban, w/ two women, pulling one woman's hair as he shows what appears to be his penis. #debates #debates2016 pic.twitter.com/11exlauthd — microchip (@wdfx2eu7) september 25, 2016  judge for yourself.       mark cuban: hillary clinton’s racist sexist billionaire [video]

__label__1 hillary clinton has almost no ground game in ohio. the video below shows what he found.  the clinton campaign is reportedly formidable. hillary clinton brags about the number of employees work on the campaign. then there are the volunteers. most americans know that ohio is a critical state in the election. at one point it was reported that clinton had over 681 paid staffers, and trump only had 68. given those numbers, the clinton campaign certainly has the upper hand over trump, right? further, though trump has beefed up his ground game nationally, clinton has added to her staff. latest numbers have the clinton campaign now with over 1000 paid staffers. the trump staffer had heard that there was a door knocking campaign, so he went down to check it out. there was an office with chairs set up for a conference style setup. the office had one guy. a bit of time passed, when a woman came out and introduced herself. besides a few volunteers behind the counter, that describes the clinton machine in that part of oh. when the trump surrogate begins discussing the truth about the operation, they don’t take it too well. when you can count your volunteers on barely two hands, you have a problem. this certainly explains the “enthusiasm gap” that has leftist media in a conniption. it further explains why clinton can’t seal the deal. latest polls have trump either closing fast or taking the lead. his fundraising certainly proves there is more enthusiasm for trump, than clinton.       hillary has almost no ground game in ohio [video]      
__label__1 a kansas sheriffs deputy was murdered on sunday by illegal immigrants that had been arrested on two occasions already. the perpetrator was adrian espinosa-flores who is 38 years old. he was charged on monday with the crime of involuntary manslaughter. allegedly, he was driving drunk and crashed his truck into a patrol car that had been stopped on the side of the road. unfortunately the crash led to the death of johnson county sheriff’s department master deputy brandon collins who was 45 years of age at the time of the accident. the kansas city star reported in the investigation. they reported that the immigration and customs enforcement had made an immigration detainer on the suspect espinosa-flores. detainers are requests that people be transferred into the custody of ice. they are specifically made for the purposes of immigration violations. an anonymous source with inside knowledge of the investigation tipped off the media that the detainer the suspect had was because of allegations he was in the country illegally. the johnson county district attorney’s office refused to answer any questions saying that it is an ongoing investigation. the suspect was arrested for dui in 2001 and in 2013 had a traffic violation however ice noted they had not been notified of these previous arrests. 41 action news reported, “it could be considered profiling because a lot of people of all races are arrested without a proper id.” people laughed donald trump off and called him a xenophobe when he pointed out all the people in the united states murdered by illegal immigrants. surely, they’re not laughing now. this very sad and tragic incident proves that trump’s comments about violent illegal immigrants is far truer than anyone would like to admit. however, come november when he builds that wall this hopefully won’t be as great of an issue anymore.         another obama success story: twice arrested illegal alien kills sheriff’s deputy      
__label__1 liberals are constantly talking about how islam is the religion of peace and tolerance. the reality is far more disturbing. liberals also like to whine about how intolerant people are in regards to lgbt rights, yet they completely ignore where the real intolerance and oppression towards gay people lies. the islamization of europe is proving just how wrong liberals are on both counts. european liberals welcomed thousands upon thousands of muslim refugees into their countries, and the results have been near catastrophic. sharia law has been creeping across europe, and for people who are hated by islam, that’s truly worrying. a sad example is a despicable attack on a gay man in brighton, england. on sunday, aaron woods was walking down the street with his friend, brian markintosh. according to markintosh, they were approached by a man who started screaming homophobic slurs at woods. but it only got worse — the man then started physically attacking woods, punching him in the face. markintosh said the attacker “was shouting all this muslim stuff … aaron was in so much pain. he was really screaming.” he continued, “he’s such a gentle giant. he’s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. he was filming the young gay guys.”  this wasn’t the first attack on gay people, either. earlier this month, a similar attack took place, when a gay couple was attacked by two men. is it merely a coincidence that the increase of muslims in europe has since an increase in homophobic attacks? the truth is that since the muslim migrants have entered europe, there has been a huge increase in crime. from attacks on gay people to sexual assault, europe is in a bad spot right now. the homophobic attacks are easily explained: sharia law teaches that homosexuality is a sin punishable by death. isis, for example, is known to kill gay people in brutal ways, such as throwing them from the tops of buildings. it’s no surprise that an increase in muslims would make europe more dangerous for gay europeans. the question is, will any liberals be honest enough to admit it? or will they continue to deny the obvious and put people’s lives at risk?       homosexual thinks muslims will accept him, instantly learns how they deal with lgbt

__label__1 obama just made himself out to be a grade a jerkface. the man thinks he has jokes, but after the joke he just told, someone needs to grab us a whole lot of rotten veggies…to throw at this horrid president. the man told jokes about isis and terrorism…and it just so happens to be on the same day that the u.s. gets bombed twice! it’s those kind of jokes that aren’t jokes really. you know, the kind people tell that want to be douchebags. the kind someone tells to look cool, but really just come out looking like an awful person. yea, that’s the kind. …but it’s the timing that was so wrong. barack obama was speaking at a dinner of the congressional black caucus. he was surrounded by peers who non-think just like him, so naturally…he thought he’d try to be funny and ended up just looking like a total ass. drum roll please…. “i don’t know about you guys, but i am so relieved that the whole birther thing is over,” obama said. “i mean, isil, north korea, poverty, climate change, none of those things weighed on my mind like the validity of my birth certificate.” watch as obama jokes at 1:55 in the video.  now people think this joke was horrid for many different reasons. one, of course is because in the same day there were 2 explosions in the u.s. caused by bombs, and a horrid stabbing after someone shouted out two words… any guesses? “allah akbar!” of course… however, i think in addition to that…the man is the president of the united states. as such, i just plain expect better character from him. maybe i’m old school, but if he is really relieved about the ‘birther’ thing being ‘over’ …. why is he talking about it, even if it’s by joke? why usher in a whole new level of sarcastic, negative contention…with a non-joke by regurgitating a topic that not only is the least of our problems, but insults the focus on our actual problems? it’s bad form, bad character, and quite very unintelligent of him to do. but…why would we expect anything more from him. he’s obama.       watch: after america is bombed twice obama jokes about terrorism      
__label__1 what a freaking disgrace mohamed elibiary is. and a stone cold enemy within as well. after the ied went off in manhattan last night, instead of going for jihadist terrorists, who i am 1000% certain are behind it, he turned around and had the nerve to blame donald trump for the blast that injured 29. that’s rich coming from a guy who was booted from the dhs advisory council for being too radical. a man who has ties to the muslim brotherhood and has said the us is an islamic country and an isis caliphate was inevitable. this is textbook… islamists and marxists always point their finger at people and blame them for things that they do or sanction. here we go again. trump no more had ties to this than the man in the moon… to say he does is a monstrous lie and libelous, not to mention extremely incendiary. if i remember correctly, he was in the air when it happened, not that it matters. pressure cooker bombs are the signature of islamic terrorism… think boston marathon. from the federalist papers project: because i guess he’s just kind of a dirtbag, mohamed elibiary again stuck his foot in his muslim mouth and decided to suggest that donald trump was behind the new york city bombing saturday night. it doesn’t matter that elibiary was terminated as a member of the department of homeland security advisory council because of his radical views. it doesn’t even matter that elibiary said that an isis caliphate was “inevitable” or that america is an “islamic country.” all of this got him in hot water. now he’s just kind of a has-been … roaming about the internet, desperate to stay relevant. perhaps that’s why he chose saturday night to make this incendiary comment:  he’s not only the first to mention it, he’ll probably be the only one. this guy is hateful. he hates american, trump and anything that is not islamic. three months ago, he attacked the coptic christian community in egypt. after a prominent coptic businessman expressed support for trump, elibiary ominously warned that support would be “not good 4 copts in egypt.” yes, i know his kind well… i have friends that are coptic and one is very connected in egypt. that was a threat. he also spoke in december of 2004 at a conference honoring virulently anti-american iranian ayatollah khomeini. elibiary is a radical islamist and he is dangerous. he’s also an unmitigated dirtbag.         former obama advisor on homeland security [muslim], speculates trump behind nyc bombing      
__label__1 a man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in st. cloud, minnesota on saturday night. he began shouting allahu akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers. the attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were muslim before stabbing the person. the attacker has now been identified as somali immigrant, dahir adan, a muslim. st. cloud somali-american community members are the ones who identified adan as the terrorist, reported sc times. on sunday isis claimed that adan was one of their own. adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a marine corps race in new jersey, a muslim man attacking new york police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in chelsea, manhattan that injured 29 civilians on saturday. members and officials of the st. cloud somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist’s family. the somali officials said that adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an “accomplished student” in high school (but of course).  st. cloud mayor dave kleis reported to the media that adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, jason falconer. kleis called falconer a hero who “happened to be in the right place at the right time.” falconer approached adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. that’s when adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him. officer falconer then proceeded to send adan to allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs. last year the washington times reported that obama’s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand somali refugees to minnesota. the times went on to say that somalis are targeted by terror groups such as isis for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on american malls. “this population is also being targeted by islamist terror organizations like the islamic state and al-shabab, a somalia-based group with links to al qaeda, according to u.s. officials.” “among minnesota-based somali-americans, american converts to islam or somali refugees, there have been numerous convictions for various levels of collaboration with islamist terror groups, plus reports of fighting with al-shabab or other islamist groups.” “al-shabab made a propaganda video warning of an attack on shopping malls around the world, including the mall of america in minnesota. al-shabab claimed responsibility for the terror attack on the westgate shopping mall in kenya two years ago, which left 67 dead.” in july of this year, world net daily reported that somali refugees in minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape. in may, voice of america news reported that isis has steadily grown stronger in somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat. “pro-islamic state somali militants have grown in numbers and are receiving financial and military support from yemen, a top intelligence official told the voa somali service.” “he said islamic state has welcomed its somalia branch and has started delivering supplies through their affiliate faction in yemen.” “they received military supplies from yemen – weapons, uniform, isis sent trainers who inspected their bases, and they have started sending financial support,” he said. in june, three somalians living in minnesota were convicted of trying to join isis. in july, the somali terror group al-shabab was approached by isis officials in an attempt to join forces to attack america. department of homeland security documents show that while hillary clinton served as secretary of state, over 31,000 somali refugees were relocated to the united states.  if hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of muslim refugees from syria alone by over 500%. breitbart news reported that under a clinton administration, the total number of muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone. it’s clear that muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by isis and other terror groups. it’s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in minnesota. men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single isis convert. and hillary clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum. hillary cannot be allowed to become president. under her rule, terror attacks on u.s. citizens will increase exponentially. all because she and the dnc want to pander to islamists in the hope that they will vote democratic, and that their party will continue to rule. a vote for hillary is a vote for isis and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing american men, women, and children. don’t vote for isis hillary on november 8th. vote trump to keep america safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to allah where they belong. selah. by jeff

__label__1 via allen west: when tragic mass attacks occur, the media generally focuses on the attacker, making the victims anonymous factors in the body count. can you name one victim of the orlando pulse nightclub attack? no of course not, but you surely know the killer. the attacker in the st. cloud mall this weekend has been identified as a 22-year-old somali man and “solider of isis.” but let’s ignore him for a moment and focus on the hero who brought him down – because you can be quite certain the liberal media doesn’t want you to know anything about him. his name is jason falconer, an off-duty police officer and firearms instructor who owns a gun range. falconer happened to be at the mall when the terrorist began carrying out his attack. the sun says, falconer opened fire as the suspect lunged towards him. he got up and continued his terrifying assault each time he was shot until he was eventually fatally wounded. morning news usa reports, “his (falconer’s) goal is to teach individuals the mindset, knowledge and skills needed to be successful with firearms in order to secure their personal safety or that of their family, at home or in public,” said tactical advantage, the off-duty police officer’s company website.  falconer told the minneapolis star tribune that he’s “been trying to stay away from it all, for the time being.” he told the newspaper he wasn’t hurt and declined to talk further, citing the ongoing investigation for not saying more. well, we’d like to give officer falconer a really big shout-out and thanks. he’s once again proven the best way to stop a bad guy with a knife is a good guy with a gun. this isn’t the ending liberals want to the story. they also don’t want you to know the attacker was asking victims if they were muslims before stabbing them. and they certainly don’t want to know an armed citizen was the one who stopped further horror. facts are nasty things.

__label__1 in the wake of the bombs found in the chelsea area of new york, seaside heights, and elizabeth, nj, we’ve received a letter from a marine, known only as “j”, that wanted his voice heard, amidst the sea of political nonsense on the mainstream media. here it is, unedited. dear obama, hillary, and liberals scared of the “t” word, i’ve served my entire adult life in the united states marine corps, and i love this country, but that’s not important, because a man is judged in life by his actions, not his words. when you were given the task of protecting america, instead of giving people the tools to do it themselves, you treated them like children that couldn’t be trusted with their own safety. you stripped away their freedoms and promised them that you had everything under control. you allowed un-vetted, america-hating refugees that pledged allegiance to isis and other radical regimes and ideologies to walk freely, while they plotted to destroy the country from within. that’s exactly how you topple an empire without firing a single shot, and you’re falling for it like a bunch of amateurs. repeat after me: you are not equipped to handle this. you’ve built your entire agenda on the false notion that fundamentalist muslims either don’t exist, or can’t harm us because they’re on the other side of the world. well, take a wild guess what happens when you import them to our shores and tell them that anyone criticizing islam should be shunned, no matter how suspicious they act. it’s how you end up with attacks like the one in san bernardino, and how you get bombings in new york city, elizabeth, and seaside heights, where marines were staging a summer run for charity, with the exact same ieds i’ve seen used to kill my brothers and sisters while serving in the middle east. when george w. bush said “fight them over there so we don’t have to fight them here,” this is what he was talking about. the fight is here, and you might as well have sent them a written invitation. if you’re too scared to say it, i will: these bombings were a textbook definition of terrorism. it doesn’t get any more clear, and every minute that goes by that you ignore it, the men willing to kill innocent people grow stronger. these attacks were enacted by those who want to literally terrorize our way of life. they hate our freedoms, and want – above all else –  to control us, much in the way that you want to control our actions, speech, and political motivations. but america is better than that. we’re not children that need to be led by the hand into a den of wolves. we’re the country of prosperity, strength, and built on the idea that we don’t take threats kindly. we have the most advanced military in the world, and a god-fearing citizenry that, unlike your liberal friends, won’t kneel to evil men. we’re the real america that you’re actively trying to silence, that gets things done by working together and ensuring that anyone coming in to the country better have a damn good reason for doing it. we support the police, that put their lives on the line when disarming a bomb, despite your best efforts to call them all racist monsters. we’re the ones going to work to keep the country running while the entitled brats that voted for you go on social media and complain about why life isn’t fair. we are the people you come running to when shit hits the fan, and we will stand no longer while you try to destroy this country by kowtowing to terrorists and fill pointless speeches with nothing but empty words and lies to the america public. the way i see it, this leaves you with three options: take action, step down, or let america run over you. the choice is yours. just don’t say i didn’t warn you. -j         this brave marine’s open letter to obama and hillary will shake america to its core      
__label__1 new york (ap) — an afghan immigrant wanted for questioning in the bombings that rocked a new york city neighborhood and a new jersey shore town was taken into custody monday after a shootout with police in new jersey, a law enforcement official told the associated press. wabc-tv footage showed a man believed to be 28-year-old ahmad khan rahami being loaded into an ambulance on a stretcher in linden, new jersey. he appeared to be conscious and looking around.  the law enforcement official, who was not authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity, said two officers were shot in the gun battle. the arrest came just hours after police issued a bulletin and photo of rahami, a naturalized u.s. citizen from afghanistan with an address in elizabeth, new jersey. authorities said the blasts were looking increasingly like an act of terrorism with a foreign connection. police did not disclose how they zeroed in on rahami but were known to be poring over surveillance video. at the same time, five people who were pulled over in a vehicle sunday night were being questioned by the fbi, officials said. the shootout came after a weekend of fear and dread in new york and new jersey. video shows bombing suspect ahmad rahami in custody in linden, new jersey. pic.twitter.com/nrvjcpnakc — eyewitness news (@abc7ny) september 19, 2016  in addition to the blast that injured 29 people in manhattan’s chelsea neighborhood on saturday, an unexploded pressure cooker bomb was found blocks away, and a pipe bomb exploded in a new jersey shore town before a charity race. no one was injured there. on sunday, five explosive devices were discovered in a trash can at an elizabeth train station. also on saturday, a man who authorities say referred to allah wounded nine people in a stabbing rampage at a minnesota mall before being shot to death by an off-duty police officer. the islamic state group claimed responsibility. authorities have not drawn any connection between the violence in minnesota and the bombings in the new york area. citing the fbi, new jersey state police said monday that the bombings in chelsea and the new jersey shore town seaside park were connected. new york gov. andrew cuomo said as investigators gathered information, they learned there were “certain commonalities among the bombs,” leading authorities to believe “that there was a common group behind the bombs.” before rahami’s capture, cuomo said investigators have no reason to believe there are further threats, but the public should “be on constant guard.” early monday, fbi agents swarmed an apartment above a fried chicken restaurant in elizabeth that is tied to rahami. the rahami family lives in the apartment. the restaurant, first american fried chicken, is owned by rahami’s father and has also employed some of his brothers, elizabeth mayor christian bollwage said. he said rahami’s father and two brothers sued the city after it passed an ordinance requiring the restaurant to close early because of complaints from neighbors about it being a late-night nuisance. ryan mccann, of elizabeth, said that he often ate at the restaurant and recently began seeing rahami working there more. “he’s always in there. he’s a very friendly guy, that’s what’s so scary. it’s hard when it’s home,” mccann said. in the immediate aftermath of the new york bombing, de new york mayor bill de blasio and cuomo were careful to say there was no evidence of a link to international terrorism. both said monday that appeared to be changing. “the more we learn with each passing hour is it looks more like terrorism,” de blasio said in an interview on ny1 news. cuomo said on msnbc: “today’s information suggests it may be foreign-related, but we’ll see where it goes.” on sunday night, fbi agents in brooklyn stopped “a vehicle of interest” in the investigation of the manhattan explosion, according to fbi spokeswoman kelly langmesser. she wouldn’t provide further details, but a government official and a law enforcement official who were briefed on the investigation told the associated press that five people in the car were being questioned at an fbi building in manhattan. the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the investigation. on sunday, a federal law enforcement official said the chelsea bomb contained a residue of tannerite, an explosive often used for target practice that can be picked up in many sporting goods stores. cellphones were discovered at the site of both the new york and new jersey bombings, but no tannerite residue was identified in the new jersey bomb remnants, in which a black powder was detected, said the official, who wasn’t authorized to comment on the investigation and spoke to the ap on condition of anonymity. the pipe bomb that exploded saturday in seaside park went off before a charity 5k race to benefit marines and sailors. the race was canceled. one of the five devices found at the elizabeth train station exploded while a bomb squad robot tried to disarm it. no one was hurt.       police capture ahmad khan rahami, suspect in ny-nj

__label__1 how mad do you have to be to be able to break a knife blade a girls neck when you stab her over 100 times? apparently as mad as a muslim man on monday! this unemployed, 32-year-old muslim bag of sh*t named jamiv usman got dumped by his then teenage girlfriend, shannon reynolds, and couldn’t handle it like a man. i believe she was 19 and he was 30 at the time. that’s perfectly within the legal limits if you’re at a strip club, but i don’t think a 30-year-old should be predatory towards a relationship with a 19-year-old. especially if he’s unemployed and can’t even provide for a family because he’s a loser. she wanted the lazy jobless muslim out of their apartment. she wanted him away from her child. she wanted nothing to do with this muslim man who would soon turn violent. jamiv usman didn’t respond well to this. he was boiling over like a pot of hot water ready to soften egg noodles for dinner. get the knife ready for the steak, because what happens next is absolute horror. after all her requests and demands for the psychopath muslim to leave, he had the nerve to ask her for a drink of water. sounds reasonable if you’re an employed muslim providing for his woman, but that wasn’t the case with this allahu akbar creep. she said no and he literally tipped over like that pot of boiling water and brutally stabbed her over 100 times with a knife. he stabbed so hard that he broke the knife in her neck!  rightwing news – she wanted him out of her apartment and she told him to get out. tensions were brewing and it eventually led usman to stab reynold’s over 100 times. the last straw for usman was when he asked her to get him a drink of water and she said no. that’s when he grabbed a big kitchen knife and plunged it into her body over 100 times in front of the toddler. he stabbed her so hard that he broke the tip of the knife in her neck. amazingly, she survived. she played dead. he left. she crawled to a bus stop and got help. eventually she healed and was able to identify her stabber and watch a judge order usman to serve up to 20 years in prison.   the good news is that this strong woman survived and recovered to see her muslim attacker thrown to the wolves in prison. hopefully the violent muslim will serve his full 20 year sentence and learn his lesson in prison. will he be shanked 100 times in the neck? probably not. those guys in prison know how to shank you once and make it count. the other 99 slashes would be for fun. i bet shannon reynolds also got sick of him being unable to be a responsible adult who is an equal force in a relationship. what did he do for her? nothing, it seems. muslim men are suppressors and oppressors. they’re like a woman’s worst nightmare. why would any woman date a muslim man? don’t they know by now that muslim men treat women worse than anything. i’m sure he could’ve found another gullible girl to date on a dating site. in fact, here’s a few ideas for dating sites specifically for muslims! if these ever become a thing, then women can sign up to be abused, stabbed, and forced to drape themselves in a black 84-inch table cloth in 95 degree weather. dating site ideas for muslims plentyofburkas.com – who needs fish when you can have a barrel of burkas. forcedmatch.com – because what girl really signs up for this? muslimmingle.com – let the sparks fly…into a building of course! tntharmony.com – go through 48 pages of questions to meet your perfect suicide partner. tanpeoplemeet.com – because sandpeoplemeet was already taken. dynamitetinder.com – swipe left to explode. muslimwifefinder – no girls, goats, and boys over 12 – lifetime guarantee. bomble – explosive dating for muslim clock builders. okvest – strictly for suicide vests enthusiasts. farmersonly – where else can we find a hefty supply of goats? oh look, i think we found a match! sorry underage girls, boys, and goats – this one is taken for the next 20 years. search again.  and if anyone is wondering about calculating the force of stabbing hard enough to break the tip off in a woman’s neck, then read this. and when you know the answer to “what the f*ck is wrong with people” then please tell us. we’re still searching for an answer.       psychopath muslim stabs teen girl 100+ times, breaks knife in her neck      
__label__1 a sergeant employed by the dallas police department has officially filed a lawsuit in federal court against the notorious black lives matter group for allegedly inciting anti police violence. the sergeant is demetrick pennie whose the president of the dallas fallen officer foundation. he’s worked in law enforcement for seventeen years. quite an impressive resume. in his lawsuit he said, “police officers and other law enforcement persons of all races and ethnicities including but not limited to jews, christians and caucasians.” defendants in the case include other race baiters such as al sharpton, president obama, hillary clinton, louis farrakhan, george soros, and the new black panthers party. pennie reports that they have, “repeatedly incited their supporters and others to engage in threats of and attacks to cause serious bodily injury or death upon police officers and other law enforcement persons of all races and ethnicities.” furthermore, the lawsuit contends that the defendants have encouraged their supporters and citizens, “to engage in threats and attacks” against law enforcement officers around the country, including the july 7 murders of five dallas police officers by micah johnson after a black lives matter demonstration.” larry klayman who is a renowned conservative lawyer of freedomwatch is representing pennie in his case. klayman told reporters in a press release, “sergeant pennie and i feel duty-bound to put ourselves forward to seek an end to the incitement of violence against law enforcement which has already resulted in the death of five police officers in dallas and the wounding of seven more, just in texas alone.” the lawsuit spans 66-pages and seeks a whopping $500 million in compensatory damages. now while that number is completely ludicrous and next to impossible to obtain pennie and klayman are likely to obtain some portion of that number. this is a copy of the lawsuit. pennie v. soros et al amended complaint by breitbarttexas on scribd  sgt. pennie told breitbart news why he felt the need to bring about this lawsuit and spoke about his motives saying, “this action was brought to stop the violence and killings of law enforcement officers in dallas and throughout the nation.” you guys certainly have our prayers that you get compensation for all the pain and suffering good cops have had to deal with over the last few years.       boom! black dallas cop suing black lives matter for starting anti-police race war      
__label__1 this is just plain sad. muslim extremists are training children to be suicide bombers. iraqi news station kurdistan news 24 caught this child suicide bombers capture on film and it went viral. at 2 minutes 17 seconds into the video you can see the child’s face. it’s a haunting look of horror and defiance on his face. the kurdish news source basnews reported that isis has recently opened a child jihadi training center in mosul called the “cubs of the caliphate,” where tiny children are brainwashed with isis ideology, taught suicide tactics, and receive instruction on combat training the barbaric islamic state is doing anything it takes to spread their caliphate across the globe. child suicide bombers is the new horrific trend of muslim extremists. in the past 6 months isis has trained over 1,000 children to become suicide bombers. it is only the very base of humanity who has ever used children in warfare and isis is the lowest of them all. i want you to imagine what kind of training is used to get a child to strap a bomb onto themselves then walk into a crowded place and detonate it. let that sink it… religion of peace indeed. a child suicide bomber detonated a bomb in his vest at a turkish wedding just last week. over a hundred were maimed or killed in the incident. the young boy in the video below was caught by iraqi police who thought he was acting suspiciously. this footage below is of the police removing the bomb from his body. anyone who uses children in such a way is going to hell and i am surprised that the muslim imams aren’t saying that. this sickening culture is spreading across europe and the united states as men roam the streets raping women and children as young as 5-yrs-old (that’s been reported) because it’s part of the culture. it is no surprise then that these same ‘men’ would use children to spread their campaign of terror and death.        watch: insane moment police rush child suicide bomber seconds from pushing button

__label__1 eric trump has had enough of hillary clinton, as we all are, but the difference is, he’s doing something about it by speaking out and making his voice heard. erichas been one of the most vocal of the trump family, outside of donald of course, when it comes to the lying shrew known as hillary clinton. thi,s weekend he called in to judge jeanine pirro’s show and absolutely destroyed her on the topic of being fit to lead. listen below and cheer along with me and he dismantles every lie hillary has ever said, exposing the worst nightmare for hillary voters – the cold, hard truth. “hard-working americans feel totally left behind by washington, d.c.,” eric trump said on justice. “we lost one-third of all our manufacturing jobs. i find it ironic that hillary spends her life in los angeles or the hamptons [n.y.]…doing fundraisers” while the elder trump holds public rallies that draw more the “15 thousand people,” he said. trump said his father has been preparing for some time, but “not by memorizing cue cards”. he “speaks with very intelligent people,” he said. he also said clinton is the definition of someone “unfit” to be commander-in-chief. “unfit is deleting emails and lying to the department of justice and lying to congress. unfit is running one of the largest ponzi schemes in american charitable history,” trump said.  absolutely right! unfit is lying to the american people about your every move, your health, and your privacy when it comes to your political life. if you can’t be transparent, you dont’ deserve to be in government at all. do you agree with trump’s words? share this with everyone you know. keep getting the word out there that we will not bow down to another clinton, especially her.

__label__1 for a little over a decade today’s millennials have been described as being part of the “everyone gets a trophy generation.” effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows. would you believe that the man behind saturday’s nj and nyc bombings once claimed to be a victim of “islamophobia?” this was allegedly such a problem that the attacker ahmad khan rahami and his father once sued the police in elizabeth new jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion. the journalists over at the daily mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here’s what they found (courtesy of louder with crowder): the prime suspect in the new york and new jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a muslim. ahmad rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in elizabeth, new jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‘selective enforcement’ based on their religion. the family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called first american, too early each night with ‘baseless’ tickets and summonses. ahmad, 28, his father mohammad sr, 53, and his brother mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘muslims don’t belong here’. the lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them. no, you’re not living in an episode of the twilight zone right now, this is real life. mayor christian bollwage insisted to the new york times that there was no such discrimination. “it was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,” bollwage said, adding, “it had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.” rahami’s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in elizabeth, nj called first american fried chicken. this is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station monday morning. his lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can’t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead. welcome to obama’s america – where even an islamic terrorist can play the victim! how insane is this? get the word out – share this post on facebook and twitter.       nyc terrorist ahmad rahami sued police department for ‘religious persecution’ in 2011!      
__label__1 one of the greatest progressive liberals of our time is senator elizabeth warren. she is notably good friends with senator bernie sanders. however, she is most known for her blatant lie about having native american ancestry. which she used in order to gain scholarships and wrote down in numerous collegiate and professional books to take advantage of minority support groups. conservatives will never let her live it down and justifiably so. a college student confronted her at an event where he took a video of her and when he confronted her about lying about her ethnicity she literally ran away. like a kid who got their hand caught in the cookie jar. watch here,  they were both at an event at ohio state university where warren was campaigning wits democratic senate candidate ted strickland for hillary clinton. they called for people to vote for hillary clinton and partake in voting on the state level but to also build a senate dominated by democrats. the young student confronted warren about losing big to donald trump to which she retorted they weren’t. but that was not enough for the young man. when warren insisted they were going to beat trump the student yelled to her that she lied about her ethnicity to get a scholarship. you could see the smoke behind her she ran away so fast. as the saying goes, if you want to upset a conservative them lie to the, but if you want to hurt a liberal then tell them the truth. donald trump got flack in the press for calling her out on the same thing too. he referenced her when he called her pochahontas. an obvious sarcastic jab at her previous deception about her ethnicity. but you reap what you sew and what goes around comes around. the best part is they aren’t lying, they’re telling the truth. warren lied and she can run but she certainly cannot hide from that.       millennial trump supporter tricks elizabeth warren into taking a selfie, drops a truth bomb on her      
__label__1 legendary athlete michael jordan made a statement about the racial violence and tension with there law enforcement community.   jordan said, “as a proud american, a father who lost his own dad in a senseless act of violence, and a black man, i have been deeply troubled by the deaths of african-americans at the hands of law enforcement. and angered by the cowardly and hateful targeting and killing of police officers. i grieve with the families who have lost loved ones, as i know their pain all too well.” he went on, “i was raised by parents who taught me to love and respect people regardless of their race or background, so i am saddened and frustrated by the divisive rhetoric and racial tensions that seem to be getting worse as of late. i know this country is better than that, and i can no longer stay silent. we need to find solutions that ensure people of color receive fair and equal treatment and that police officers—who put their lives on the line every day to protect us all—are respected and supported.” jordan went on to talk about and praise law enforcement and how they have helped and protected him and his family in the past. but, he also acknowledged the fact that many african americans do not feel the same way and have had a tremendously different experience with police that is not necessarily positive. the most touching part of his statements was when he called for change and for everybody to work together to attain that outcome. the star finished by saying, “to support that efforts, i am making contributions of $1 million each to two organizations, the international association of chiefs of police’s newly established institute for community-police relations and the naacp legal defense fund. although i know these contributions alone are not enough to solve the problem, i hope the resources will help both organizations make a positive difference.” people on twitter and social media were quick to call him an uncle tom saying that his money was not needed and won’t make a difference. what he did though is highly profound. not only did he acknowledge that yes, there is a problem in which african americans are disproportionately discriminated against by police, he also acknowledged that most police officers are good people and deserve to be safe, healthy, and respected. he is able to come at it from both angles. and he put his money where his mouth is by donating a significant portion of money. a man of talk and action. which is what is missing. everyone talks but no one takes action. he did just that. unlike another person who shall remain unnamed.. cough cough (colin kaepernick). he is able to see both sides and as an african american man who says that he will likley have a far greater impact than if a white man said it. it’s the voices of our friends we listen  to most. whether we want to admit it or not, black people don’t want to hear white people preaching about racism. but when a black man says something they are more apt to listen.       basketball legend michael jordan donated 2 mil to support police, so blacklivesmatter responds with this      
__label__1 good luck getting through this video without wanting to punch your screen. this guy is a wreck. he was pulled over for a traffic violation, and from the get go was the most obnoxious, immature, race-baiting buttface you have probably heard in a very long time. i have got to hand it to the police officer, this is the kind of garbage they have to deal with now all the time… even soccer moms are being absolute terrors to police officers when they get pulled over now. what used to be a every now and then difficulty has become a daily thing for these police officers to have to deal with. all the sudden with obama’s america everyone feels entitled, and have learned a few big words that they like to use when police pull them over…to try and what? make the police hesitate because of all the blm garbage going on? make them feel like they can break the law and not have to answer to police if they are a minority? can you imagine how patient the police have to be now? no one and i repeat no human being could possibly be as patient through this kind of treatment day and day out everyday. i dare anyone to try who thinks they can without going off eventually. what’s worse about this guy…is as soon as he got pulled over he popped out his phone and had no problem live streaming the whole thing. then as he’s being all self-righteous and using his big words to call on a supervisor…he hides drugs. yes.. hides drugs! he is shouting up and down that he’s being treated unfairly, and he’s done nothing wrong….then on live video…hides his drugs, while police are at their vehicles.. how did so many americans get so stupid in just 8 years? it’s embarrassing… i mean after what this guy did…i wouldn’t be surprised if the iq of the entire world just dropped a 100 points. watch…i’m sure you’ll feel the same afterwards.  now you can go to jail man…and it’s all your own fault.       whoops! black man claims stopped by police for ‘being black’, but accidentally films his drugs…      
__label__1 the story of last saturday’s minnesota mall stabbing attack was the result of a lack of integration from muslim immigrants. the suspect was 22 year old college student dahir adan, who is a somali-american. he stabbed nine people before being shot dead by a former police chief and concealed carry permit holder. as we should’ve expected, it took a good guy with a gun to end the situation. hilarious (or pathetically?) it took the media a few days to identify this as an islamist attack, despite the fact that the attacker was literally shouting “allah akbar” as he was stabbing people. did they think he misspoke and mean to be shouting “praise jesus!”? yeah…. i don’t think so either. as it turns out, both adan and the rest of his family were immigrants who made no attempt to assimilate into american culture whatsoever. as the young cons reported: adan his father, ahmed adan, said, through a translator, that he had no indication that his son was a terrorist, according to the tribune. the elder adan said his son was a somalian who was born in kenya and came to america from his african home about 15 years ago. the islamic state has since claimed responsibility for the attack and called adan “a soldier of the islamic state” who “carried out the operation in response to the citizens of countries belonging to the crusader coalition.” adan’s father, with help of a translator, said he had no idea his son was a terrorist. he added that dahir came to america 15 years ago after being born in kenya. people had a lot to say about middle eastern and african refugees assimilating in america… @anncoulter assimilation of immigrants, total bs, 15 yrs and can’t speak english, they want to change usa not be part of it, hate america — dispicable justkate (@justkate038) september 19, 2016  does it look like somali refugees are assimilating to america’s tolerant values? @tuckercarlson @foxandfriends https://t.co/hmwu1asmlf — adorable deplorable (@olimauritania) september 19, 2016  mn mall stabber’s family in us for 15 years. his father confirmed his identity “speaking…through an interpreter” https://t.co/wxhomoc5fw — ann coulter (@anncoulter) september 18, 2016  in europe, particularly those countries that have taken in massive amounts of muslim migrants, particularly france belgium, and the netherlands, there have definitely been problems assimilating muslim immigrants. if you poll american muslims, you’ll find that the vast majority describe themselves as “muslim first,” instead of “american first.” and when trump says he’d deport all muslims who express support for sharia law, there are liberals who have a problem with that! think about that for a second…       mall terrorist father releases statement on son, proves how liberals will spin narrative

__label__1 saturday obama gave a speech to the black congressional caucus where he had ample opportunity to give courage to americans in a scary time. however, he didn’t say anything about the recent attacks then and as of noon (east coast time) monday, president barack obama has made zero comments on the string of terrorist attacks hitting cities in the united states. over the weekend there were a number of terror attacks in the name of ‘allah’ that has devastated some communities and killed or injured dozens of people. check out the list below and tell me if you think the president should have made a speech saturday, sunday or especially today to give solace to the victims families and communities being terrorized? watch the latest video at <a href=”http://video.foxnews.com”>video.foxnews.com</a> freedom daily reported earlier: new jersey, 8am saturday suspect: ahmad rahami (arrested), possible 4 other suspects in custody from afghanistan 3 pipe bombs wired together in a dumpster in new jersey targeting a 5k run for marines. minnesota, 8pm saturday suspect: dahir adan (fatally wounded) muslim man went on a stabbing spree… stabbing eight people before being shot by police. new york, 8:40pm saturday suspect: ahmad rahami (arrested), possible 4 other suspects in custody from afghanistan manhattan a bomb went off injuring 29 people. pressure cooker was found with wiring and a timing device. new york, 3:00am sunday suspect: ahmad rahami (arrested), possible 4 other suspects in custody from afghanistan explosive device was found around the chelsea area. this just in- new jersey, 1am monday suspect: ahmad rahami (arrested), possible 4 other suspects in custody from afghanistan pipe bomb explodes near a new jersey train station. i have watched obama not lead for nearly 8 years. his lack of guts, integrity and leadership is the greatest reason that muslim extremists feel brave enough to walk around american streets with bombs and set them wherever they want. the united states needs a real president who can lead america in a time of crisis. if you don’t believe we are in crisis, we are in greater trouble than i thought.       speaking in ny, obama shocks americans with what he says about attacks      
__label__1 a public high school has been accused of indoctrinated islam into their students. allegedly, the school has been mandating children profess the islamic statement of faith, memorize the five pillars of islam, as well as teaching students that the muslims faith is stronger than a christian or jews. this is all according to lawsuit filed in federal court this past wednesday. the lawsuit was filed on behalf of john and melissa wood with the thomas more law center and the action is being taken against la plata high school in maryland. according to john wood the school banished him from their property when he complained about the islamic teachings. richard thompson, president of thomas more, said, “defendants forced wood’s daughter to disparage her christian faith by reciting the shahada, and acknowledging mohammed as her spiritual leader.” the law center commented that for non muslims such as christians and jews that reciting the shahada islamic creed which is their statement of faith is the equivalent of converting. spokespeople for the charles county public schools have refused to comment other than to say they have not received any such lawsuit yet. however, the principal evelyn arnold, vice principal shannon morris, and charles county board of education were all named in the lawsuit. the lawsuit says, “during its brief instruction on christianity, defendants failed to cover any portion of the bible or other non-islamic religious texts, such as the ten commandments. instead, the class included disparaging remarks about christianity and the pope. such discriminatory treatment of christianity is an unconstitutional promotion of one religion over another. united states supreme court precedent does not create a double standard that allows for the promotion of islam in our public schools while disallowing and silencing teachings of christianity and judaism.” classroom assignment copies indicate the teachers were instructing students that most muslim people’s faith are stronger than that of the average christian. as well, the copies show they taught students that islam is a peaceful religion that treated their conquered nations with kindness and respect too. part of the handout reads, “nowhere in the koran does it say you will go to paradise if you martyr yourself with a suicide bomb. important: the majority of muslims do not live this way.” it referenced the jihad as, “a holy war waged on behalf of islam as a religious duty; a personal struggle in devotion to islam especially involving spiritual discipline.” this reportedly occurred during the 2014-2015 school year. so lord only knows what these teachers have been education these students about for the past few years. despite the fact the thomas more center has taken on this case neither the american civil liberties union or the freedom from religion foundation have weighed in on the issue.             outraged parents file lawsuit: “public school forced my child to convert to islam”      
__label__1 nfl spirals even further into the gutter after the miami dolphins announce that they will be joining in on the kaepernick roadshow of disrespecting, ungrateful, and entitled multi-millions-dollar idiot athletes. this time though…there will be consequences for their stupidity. just as they made the announcement, the police union also had one of theirs’ to make, and you might like this. like…a lot. the dolphin players who are sitting out during the “star-spangled banner” believe that their butt to chair crap is going to help the black community. of course, using their multi-millions to help make the community better isn’t their idea of helping…no, that would be too much for them to commit to. so instead, they take easiest more ineffective choice…because they are selfish a-holes like that. …yet the ‘black community’ they are “helping” adores them for it. really? it’s insanity really. their dishonorable black lives matter protest is against the very men and women who are willing to sacrifice everything, and have proven it time and time again when they have. it’s sick. of course, many are not taking a stand for something they believe in but taking a stand to try and stay relevant. just like colin kaepernick, his career was deteriorating…and he needed something. however, what they probably don’t get yet…is in this case, not even bad publicity is going to be good for them. not when it involves hatred towards our heroes. that’s just bad form… so now, guess what? since the dolphin players have confirmed that they will continue kneeling during the national anthem, the police union has responded with their own announcement. they are calling for broward county sheriff’s office to stop providing police escorts for the ungrateful, selfish, and wretched team. association president jeff bell announced on the union’s facebook page that they have contacted the executive board not only to condemn the anti-police, pro-blm actions of the dolphins but also to request that they cease attending events in which they’re unwanted. “we have buried coworkers who have unnecessarily lost their lives protecting the lives of individuals. some law enforcement officers even lost their lives while protecting the lives of the very same individuals who were protesting against law enforcement. the broward sheriff’s office deputies association local 6020 is seeking the immediate termination of all miami dolphin escorts until such time the miami dolphins and the national football league set forth a policy that will not tolerate the disrespect of the american flag and national anthem during any sanctioned games or events.” of course the police union understands that it is the right of these entitled morons to choose to disrespect the flag, and country that allows them to live out their dreams…but it is also the right of the police officers to decide that they won’t provide optional security to those who don’t want them there and wish them harm because of ignorance. how hypocritical right? i’m embarrassed really. the world is definitely rooting for america to win, because if we don’t…they don’t either. however, i’m sure they are watching in on what is happening here…and shaking their heads. we are no longer a leading nation…that others can look to and respect. not with that idiot president in the white house that only knows how to lead from behind, divide a people, and cause chaos among brothers and sisters. he is no leader…look at the garbage that is going on now. of course, the 4 miami players who refused to stand for the anthem immediately attempted to downplay their disrespect after word surfaced that the sheriff’s office may boycott their events. according to the daily dolphin, jelani jenkins provided an absurdly hypocritical response, saying that he wasn’t insulting law enforcement or the military. “most important, man, i just want equal rights for everybody,” jenkins said sunday. “hopefully we’re raising awareness and pushing for change. i want it to be known that it’s no disrespect to the military or to police officers. and 9/11, i respect everything about it. my perspective is that there are people hurting. it means a lot to me to not be quiet about it.” so minorities in america don’t have equal rights? well if that were true, i myself would not even exist. my parents immigrated to america with nothing but their hard work ethic, and hope for better days in a free land. now they are living their dreams that were awarded to them by this free country through their sheer will power and hard work. also, raising up 3 great police officers to serve and protect in their communities and me… who chooses to follow in their footsteps in teaching my children to be grateful and have love for country and respect and honor for our heroes. so… these fools, can take a seat. their message is redundant.       dolphins vow to kneel for anthem, police union replies with vow of its own      
__label__1 here is another great example of why you need to be professional on your personal facebook profile. because people get nosy and then they get whiny! the news report says the “muslim organizations” are very concerned about a facebook post shared by school board chairwoman christie new craig. it’s a cartoon and it raise a very valid question: “muslims hate pork, beer, dogs, bikinis, jesus, and freedom of speech. my question is, what the hell do they come to america for?!” i guess i am curious about that myself, often. m’hammed abdous, president of the muslim community of tidewater, who has no children within the school district had heard about the comic from a chesapeake resident and said, “i found it saddening and disappointing that kind of language came from someone involved in educating children,” it’s just a cartoon. craig gave a clever response to the complaint pointing out that she had not commented on the post or endorse it in any way. “i did not post that maliciously,” she said last week while claiming to not hate any racial groups or religions. “i’m not racist. i wasn’t raised that way.i share a lot of stuff, a lot of jokes and whether i support it or not, i share stuff,” she added in a phone interview with wavy news. “[it] doesn’t mean i agree with it. it does mean i have a right to expression and free speech.” abdous demanded an apology which he’ll likely get since it wasn’t that big of deal to mrs. craig. the irony of it all is part of the cartoon said that muslims hate freedom of speech. roflmao yeah it’s really funny that this guy is upset that mrs. craig gets to post whatever she wants on her fb page.        woman on school board asks muslims 1 question: then all hell breaks loose      
__label__1 germany’s chancellor angela merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants. this quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto german cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year. the german people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to merkel’s conservative democrat party and voted them out by a large margin. merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”  according to the daily mail, speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‘a continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like germany,’ she said. the leader, once known as the ‘iron chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. however, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‘we want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in karlsruhe. ‘with an approach focused on the german, european and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’ mrs merkel attempted to defend her august decision, which drew hundreds of thousands to europe, claiming it was a ‘humanitarian imperative’. she appealed to the party’s sense of history, saying that the same strength that allowed it ‘to rebuild from the rubble of the war to create the economic miracle, and to go from division to a reunified country’ would get germany through the crisis. she said she was banking on a multi-pronged approach to cut migrant numbers, urging bolstered protection for the bloc’s external borders, support for turkey to host refugees long-term and a long-shot bid for a distribution scheme among eu member states. she also touted a range of measures already undertaken in germany including speeding up the deportation of failed asylum applicants. mrs merkel, who has been the country’s leader for a decade, tried to paint an upbeat vision saying it was no longer the ‘sick man of europe’ and ‘should be a country that is open, curious, tolerant and even exciting’.  it’s nice that she recognizes this, but it’s too little, too late. it came as no surprise to anyone voting trump, but then again, it’s getting tiring to say “i told you so” so many times to so many different people. hillary is still full-steam ahead on increasing the number of migrants into the country, so there’s no telling what can happen if she is allowed to win the election. we have to stop her in november by storming the voting booths and voting with our consciences.

__label__1 the drudge report has gained access to the rules for the upcoming mega-debate between hillary and trump. hillary’s always angling for an advantage, and when it comes to the mainstream media, hillary usually gets exactly what she wants. it looks like she’ll get a custom podium to help her with the height advantage, but when it comes to coughing up a lung, hillary’s on her own. let’s hope for hillary’s sake, she’s able to keep the guy with the diazinon pen close to the stage in case “unfit to run for office hillary” has another “pneumonia-related incident” like the one on 911…  debate rules: no coughing breaks **exclusive** fri sep 23 2016 11:30:40 et if presidential hopeful hillary clinton slips into a coughing fit or any other medical crisis during monday’s high-stakes debate, she will have to power through, the drudge report has learned! “there are no commercial breaks,” a commission source explains. “period.” debate moderator lester holt does not have the authority to cut away from the stage during the epic 90-minute showdown. and microphone audio for either of the candidates is not to be manipulated. clinton has experienced severe coughing episodes throughout the election year. during a labor day campaign stop she suffered a 4-minute choking marathon. monday’s throwdown could top out at 100 million viewers, making it the biggest political event in history. editor’s note: the presidential debate commission settled an early flashpoint when clinton demanded a step-stool at the podium to add height to her 5’4″ frame. campaign chairman john podesta expressed concern that hillary would be dwarfed by 6’2″ trump. the request was quickly rejected. the commission is allowing for a custom-made podium, which will accommodate the difference in stature.       grab the popcorn! queen of corruption denied special treatment for first debate

__label__1 the first presidential debate between republican nominee donald trump and democratic nominee hillary clinton is scheduled to take place monday, september 26. moderated by nbc’s lester holt, the debate will take place at long island’s hofstra university. the format will be a 90-minute program without commercial breaks. personally, i have to admit that i can’t wait to see the real estate magnate and the former secretary of state engage in a verbal boxing match. apparently, i am not alone. the first trump-clinton face off is anticipated by experts to draw “as many as 100 million viewers – reaching almost as many people as the super bowl.” barack obama’s first debate with mitt romney in 2012, garnered over 70 million viewers, which was the highest number for a debate since 1980 when 80.6 million viewers tuned in to watch president jimmy carter debate republican presidential candidate, ronald reagan. the reasons for the unprecedented interest are apparent. the 2016 presidential race has been patently different from any presidential campaign in recent history. first of all, the race is incredibly close. clinton only has an aggregate lead of 3 points over trump in the national race. however, trump currently has the lead in several battleground states including  florida, north carolina and ohio.  on the most basic level, the two candidates who have been called everything from the “most polarizing” to the “least-liked” candidates in history are also the most interesting. in the democratic corner, you have hillary clinton, the woman who has spent most of her adult life in politics and arguably has been aspiring to the presidency for over 20 years. you only have to read her college thesis to see that the seeds of her ambition were already germinating on the wellesley campus. obviously, clinton also brings to the arena not only her past history as a former  first lady, former senator and former secretary of state, she also brings a suite of scandals involving her use of an unsecured email server during her tenure at the state department, quid for quo dealings involving the clinton foundation etc. in the republican corner, you have donald trump, a real estate billionaire whose last name has graced everything from hotels to ties. trump also deepened his fame by becoming a reality show creator and star with his now legendary show “the apprentice.” one could argue that being a reality star was the perfect training ground for diving into the fishbowl called politics. the debate‘s anticipated high ratings are also predicated on the assumption that everyone wants to witness the dynamics between clinton and trump in a one on one conversation format. we have heard a lot about their different styles of debate preparation. supposedly, trump has been studying videos of  clinton to better understand her body language and facial gestures. clinton has been  reportedly using her long time aide philippe reines as the “trump” stand-in during mock debate sessions. it will be interesting to see what happens when these two individuals who have been spending the last few months attacking each other indirectly via media interviews, campaign rallies and tweets actually get into the same room. when was the last time that happened? january 22, 2005, the day of donald trump’s marriage to melania knauss? yes, that’s right bill and hill were guests at the donald’s third nuptial ceremony. over the last few weeks, there has been a lot of speculation about mrs. clinton’s health and whether she is physically capable of serving as president. her recent fainting episode at the 15th anniversary of the september 11thattacks (which has been since explained as a reaction to pneumonia) has been feeding the “bad health” rumors which have been circulating since her 2012 concussion. most recently, the speculation has deepened with theories covering everything from parkinsons to a neurological problem. it has not helped the situation that mrs. clinton has also had public instances where she appeared physically unstable or in need of assistance mounting stairs. and of course, most recently a video has circulated of mrs. clinton addressing a largely union audience where she asked the rhetorical question of why she isn’t 50 points ahead of donald trump in the race. more than one pundit has described her demeanor in this video as “unhinged.” as for mr. trump, critics point to situations where he spoke bluntly such as saying that we need to bar all muslims from entering the united states until we have a mechanism for vetting them. he also famously received a lot of criticism for his early remarks that some of the mexicans entering the united states illegally are “rapists and drug dealers.”  many viewers may tune in to see if trump will put his foot in his mouth. many will approach the debate with this perspective despite the fact that for the last two months trump has been vigorously campaigning, delivering one policy speech after another while staying very much on message. of course, the whole point of a presidential debate is for the candidates to have an opportunity to showcase their platforms to the american people. obviously, their ability to effectively answer the moderator’s questions within the confines of a designated time frame and other guidelines are part and parcel of the debate. while viewers may be intrigued by the spectacle, they are also interested in hearing more about the issues. while we have heard a lot about trump’s policies, we have not heard as much about clinton’s.  although, this week we did hear that she plans to impose a 65% estate tax on the wealthiest individuals. i am sure people may want to hear more about that. also, media bias has played a huge role in the campaign. many people may be tuning to see if lester holt will be a fair moderator. of course, the primary reason people are tuning in to the debate is that the winner of the debate may very well become the winner of the election for  the us presidency. after all, the race is all about who has the best vision, the best plan and the likelihood of ultimately delivering the best results for the american people.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      why tonight’s debate will garner an estimated 100 million viewers      
__label__1 in every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. the national democratic party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available. [read related article: the democratic party: america’s most powerful hate group] as a christian and constitutional conservative who has studied political science and understands what the democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the united states, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “hillary the horrible” into the presidency in the november, 2016 election. a proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. however, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the democratic party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the november election for president – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud. the proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. this translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo id that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. the democratic party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential democratic party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, hillary the horrible, to become the next and last president of the soon-to-be-extinct united states of america. due to the unfortunate fact that the democratic party, the obama administration, our treasonous congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the american people have as our only recourse in the november election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible. donald trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on friday, september 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. the democratic party, america’s most powerful “hate group,” not only wants “hillary the horrible” to be elected and transform america into a dictatorship and hell on earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed. let us agree that november 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the national democratic party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in america who value constitutional conservatism and our judeo-christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. if trump is to win, and hillary the horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt national democratic party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the conservative pro-american public.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      how democrats are going to try to steal the election for hillary

__label__1 a daisy of a rerun i am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in presidential campaigning. that being the tv advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.  the year was 1964 and the incumbent president lyndon b johnson “approved” that message. only problem was that he followed the course in vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, barry goldwater. today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting johnson’s deceitful war policies, goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our nation’s media. i mention this as a backdrop of our current presidential campaign. just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each clinton failure. such a rendering, depicting reasons why clinton is unworthy of the presidency, would be shattering to her campaign. obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “daisy” remake aimed against trump, has been mentioned. that being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the clinton staffers. somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against clinton as i previously mentioned, its message could outweigh goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events. instead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” with the recent about-face announcement from ted cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected. now, another unbalanced ap report unfolded, this one detailing ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided republican party.” this in addition to previous statements in which cruz called trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.” as the article relates, trump countered with his nickname of “’lyin ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the john f. kennedy assassination.” these actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder. schools of journalism teach that americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. so, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph? another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. i say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. this exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance. it is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. this extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing.  also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the ap ignores, needs no further explanation. also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the candy crowley faux pas. especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. in an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its ap exclusion. these quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections. with that, consider the president’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, obama stated of hillary, “she will say anything and change nothing. hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be president.” obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about benghazi had yet to occur. not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame. also during that same campaign, future first lady michelle offered this opine:  “if you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the white house.”  apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review. again, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? that type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      michelle obama attacks hillary: “if you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the white house”      
__label__1 when reading an article like this, think of manmade global warming… from the daily caller news foundation: government funding of scientific research has a corrupting influence that could cause more unethical behavior among researchers, according to a new study by scientists at virginia tech. researchers found federal funding is encouraging scientists to falsify data and publish bad research. the study found that universities are making the problem worse by mostly hiring young scientists as adjuncts, not tenure-track positions, which increases the financial pressures causing them to distort science. “over the last 50 years, we argue that incentives for academic scientists have become increasingly perverse in terms of competition for research funding, development of quantitative metrics to measure performance, and a changing business model for higher education itself,” marc edwards and siddhartha roy, researchers at virginia tech, wrote in their study. edwards was the scientist who helped expose that the environmental protection agency’s (epa) top midwest official knew about the flint, michigan drinking water crisis months before telling the public. “furthermore, decreased discretionary funding at the federal and state level is creating a hypercompetitive environment between government agencies (e.g., epa, nih, cdc), for scientists in these agencies, and for academics seeking funding from all sources—the combination of perverse incentives and decreased funding increases pressures that can lead to unethical behavior,” they wrote. government funding of research produces enormous financial incentives for scientists to engage in dubious laboratory research. academics are under serious financial pressure to rapidly and continually publish research to sustain or further their careers, even if the research is essentially useless or misleading. even major scientific journals like nature are asking “is science broken?” “the first problem are that the government provides monopoly funding for fields which are related to regulatory efforts, and much of that funding is spent with a foregone conclusion in mind,” dr. pat michaels, the director of the center for the study of science at the cato institute who was not involved in the study, told the daily caller news foundation. “we don’t fund billions and billions of dollars of climate research each year to find that global warming isn’t a problem. politics has intruded into the scientific process.” due to this monopoly, scientists also have a huge incentive to tweak, or outright fake, statistical analyses to make results seem significant or to align with government priorities. a growing number of scientists have noticed the wave of retractions, especially among social scientists. polling indicates that such consequences are causing science itself to become less trusted. “it also raises legitimate and disturbing questions as to whether accepting research funding from federal agencies is inherently unethical or not—modern agencies clearly have conflicts similar to those that are accepted and well understood for industry research sponsors,” edwards and roy continue in the study. “given the mistaken presumption of research neutrality by federal funding agencies, the dangers of institutional research misconduct to society may outweigh those of industry-sponsored research.” a study found that 34 percent of researchers self-report that they have engaged in “questionable research practices,” including “dropping data points on a gut feeling” and “changing the design, methodology, and results of a study in response to pressures from a funding source,” whereas 72 percent of those surveyed knew of colleagues who had done so. virginia tech researchers note that the national science foundation estimates that research misconduct creates over $110 million in annual costs. “the second problem is that universities are biased towards federal funding, and will thus always be cheer-leading towards a dire view and treat people who don’t share that view very badly,” dr. michaels continued. “we’ve seen that repeatedly in climate science. there are enormous selective pressures to publish research that is dire and not publish research that is not. we’re creating biased canons of research because nobody will get a federal grant to study if global warming will have beneficial effects. the peer reviewers have a vested interest in making sure that the gravy train keeps rolling down the track.” in addition to outright fraud, these incentives lead to researchers not even bothering to write up negative results, as scientific journals tend to only publish the flashiest and most popular research. this biases the scientific canon and leads to duplication of research. only seemingly groundbreaking research can lead to government grant money, scientific prizes, and potential tenure track jobs. “the entire american model of getting published, getting funded, then getting promoted means that people aren’t publishing negative results,” michaels told thedcnf. they’re only publishing flashy research. getting published in science, nature or cell is a ticket to future funding, promotion and tenure. this is giving young scientists an incentive to go into flashy fields that might get them on television, not important ones. this has created systematic problems in science.” as a result of these problems, researchers have a documented tendency to find evidence of phenomenons they happen to believe in and to reject observations that are unpopular with federal funders. in a survey of two thousand research psychologists conducted in 2011, over half admitted they selectively reported experiments, which gave the result they were after.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle

__label__1 should he or shouldn’t he? should debate moderator lester holt “fact-check” the candidates?  that is one of the big questions about tonight’s debate at hofstra, university. imho being a moderator at a debate is a lot like being an umpire at a baseball game. if you leave the game talking about the umpire it means the umpire screwed up. but just like major decisions in my household, the question of fact-checking is not my decision; it’s the moderator’s and there is pressure on him from team clinton and the liberal media to play truth police as well as moderate the debate. in 2012, candy crowley was more than a moderator at the hofstra debate. she was an active participant not allowing romney to answer obama’s attacks, and incorrectly fact-checking the republican candidate. the hofstra debate in 2012 will always be known as the one candy crowley screwed up. it is also known as the one where candy crowley stalked me. i was in the spin room for that debate and she kept trying to take over my computer. that experience is one of the reasons i decided not to go this year (well that and the fact that i didn’t get credentialed). candy crowley’s faux pas changed the momentum of the race. barack obama lost the first debate badly, and romney was winning debate number two, until crowley got involved. read the rest of the story at jeff dunetz’s blog the lid  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      should debate moderator lester holt fact-check the candidates?      
__label__1 adam walinsky once worked for president john f. kennedy. he wrote speeches for bobby (rfk) kennedy, and bill clinton once worked on his national committee for the police corps. he is a longtime democrat operative, politician, and leader, and in a recent article for politico, walinsky shocked the nation when he announced that he would be voting for donald trump on november 8th. i was a democrat all my life. i came to washington to serve president john kennedy and attorney general robert kennedy. when the president was murdered and his brother struck off on his own, i joined his senate campaign and staff as his legislative assistant and speechwriter, until his presidential campaign ended with his own assassination. i ran on a (losing) democratic ticket in the new york state elections of 1970. when i was working to enact my own program of police reform in the 1980s and 1990s, then-governor bill clinton was chairman of my national committee for the police corps. this year, i will vote to elect donald trump as president of the united states. the question many are asking today is, why? why would a long-time and highly respected democrat defect at such a crucial time in our history? why would walinsky abandon the most establishment-friendly candidate in recent memory, to vote for a republican outsider who eschews much of the democrat party platform. so profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision. walinsky focused on one key aspect of the campaign – foreign policy: here it is. john and robert kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. to them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. but today’s democrats have become the party of war: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. walinsky hammers one key area of today’s democrat party that many libertarians and some conservatives have decried for years. the democrat party is the party of hypocrisy when it comes to war and foreign policy. the very same people who for years marched against war during the bush administration, have fallen silent during the obama years. this reality is stunning, considering that president obama has led us through 8 years of constant warfare (numbers below accurate as of may 2016): —2,499 u.s. soldiers have been killed in afghanistan and iraq so far under president obama, according to the independent iraq coalition casualty count. —of those, 1,906 have been killed in and around afghanistan, and 593 in iraq. —under obama, the united states has been at war for 2,687 days. that’s longer than under george w. bush — or any other u.s. president, for that matter. —obama has conducted airstrikes on seven countries: afghanistan, iraq, pakistan, somalia, yemen, libya and syria. (that’s three more countries than george w. bush bombed.) —u.s. combat forces are deployed on the ground in three countries: iraq, afghanistan and syria. that’s one more war than obama inherited, and which his successor will likely have to contend with.  because of these truths and the reality that much of obama’s foreign policy vision was crafted, developed, and carried out by hillary clinton, have led walinsky to the realization that donald trump may be the most likely candidate to bring peace to our nation. throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with president putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. on this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election… donald trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, “america first.” but to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of american statesmen from the founders on. only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond. i urge you to read all of walinsky’s well-crafted argument in support of donald trump. he delivers paragraphs of excoriating commentary against the democrat party, while explaining why, despite his faults, donald trump may indeed be the man for this moment. if you believe america is starved for change, and many voters do, then the only candidate who offers any hope of real change is donald trump. hillary clinton not only represents “more of the same” from washington, d.c., she is the progenitor, and an ardent supporter of many of our worst, most ineffective policies, ideas, and plans. voting against clinton doesn’t only mean voting for change; it means voting against some of our worst political failures of the last 30 years. reposted with permission from constitution.com  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      bobby kennedy speechwriter and longtime democrat operative on why he’s voting for donald trump      
__label__1 on friday, i reported that of those arrested in charlotte, north carolina, 70% of the provocateurs and rioters were from out of state. however, one writer is now questioning why they are not facing federal charges of crossing state lines in order to engage in rioting and destruction. james lonstreet writes at the american thinker that the department of justice has a “disinterest for certain laws” and it has engaged in “non-enforcement of the law has become sport in the past eight years.” lonstreet says that the number of out of state rioters who have been arrested should pique the interest of the doj, but it doesn’t. instead, the justice department has become so corrupt that it no longer seeks justice. he writes: criminals disguised as protestors cross state lines to engage in destruction and rioting.  has anyone heard of the statute that prohibits crossing state lines to engage in such behavior being enforced by federal authorities? from the federal judicial center, 2101. riots: (a) (1) whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses any facility of interstate or foreign commerce or uses any facility of interstate or foreign commerce, including, but not limited to, the mail, telegraph, telephone, radio, or television, with intent – (a) to incite a riot; or (b) to organize, promote, encourage, participate in, or carry on a riot; or (c) to commit any act of violence in furtherance of a riot; or (d) to aid or abet any person in inciting or participating in or carrying on a riot or committing any act of violence in furtherance of a riot; and who either during the course of any such travel or use or thereafter performs or attempts to perform any other overt act for any purpose specified in subparagraph (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this paragraph shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. (b) in any prosecution under this section, proof that a defendant engaged or attempted to engage in one or more of the overt acts described in subparagraph (a), (b), (c), or (d) of paragraph (1) of subsection (a) and (1) has traveled in interstate or foreign commerce, or (2) has use of or used any facility of interstate or foreign commerce, including but not limited to, mail, telegraph, telephone, radio, or television, to communicate with or broadcast to any person or group of persons prior to such overt acts, such travel or use shall be admissible proof to establish that such defendant traveled in or used such facility of interstate or foreign commerce. there is a wisdom to such laws, one that predicts how local situations can blossom into much larger events when interlopers are allowed to exacerbate the situation.  these laws need to be enforced.  they are not.  it is fair to ask, “why not?” recall in ferguson that the influx of non-residents (revolution club of chicago, new black panthers, etc.) who came to join in the fray was noted by local authorities, yet there was no action from federal authorities regarding the enforcement of statues prohibiting the crossing of state lines to engage in such behavior. whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the united states or the laws thereof, or gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the united states. (june 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 stat. 808; pub. l. 103–322, title xxxiii, § 330016(1)(l), sept. 13, 1994, 108 stat. 2147.)” source he then concludes, “there are two clarities. the administration has sympathies in one direction, and the department of justice has disinterest in another direction.” this is not the first time that lonstreet has brought this issue up. in 2014, he wrote on the issue when it was the new black panthers stirring up rioting in ferguson, missouri. at that time, he cited the same law and wrote, “the proof is for all to see. the new black panthers once again are not prosecuted at the choice of federal authorities. (recall philadelphia polling incident.) need we mention who those authorities are?” picking and choosing which laws to enforce is problematic for sure. this administration not only often targets innocent americans, but then allows the lawless to escape punishment. perhaps it’s time the people brought justice upon their criminal representatives in dc and institute new government, as the declaration of independence advises us to do. reposted with permission from freedom outpost  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      why aren’t the out-of-state rioters facing federal charges?      
__label__1 hbo’s real time host bill maher – someone not often inclined to side with donald trump – said that trump is right about profiling in the context of how to deal with terrorism. here’s what he said: “he is for profiling, that’s what he said. but he said we should do it the way israel does. and, like, every once in while donald trump says something right. because we profile already, we just do it stupidly. all police work is profiling. discrimination does not mean prejudice; discrimination means telling un-like things apart… “what they do is they hire really smart people. this is not the tsa, which is just guys giggling at your balls when they’re looking — a screener. if we would pay people $100,000 to do this job, we could get the kind of people who do it in israel. “and, again, we’re just talking about a few questions. we’re not talking about the rubber hose or sending you to a black site. i mean, i don’t think this is too much of a sacrifice to ask.” he’s definitely right about the tsa. their scanners and pat-down agents don’t do anything to prevent terrorism. not only has the tsa caught zero terrorists and stopped zero terrorist attacks, they have a 95% failure rate. that means, that they’ll catch contraband roughly 5% of the time. the rest of the time, it gets through. it’s a wonder that we haven’t dealt with another 9/11-style attack over the past 15 years. how does an institution with such an abysmal track record even exist?

__label__1 you’ve probably seen the bumper stickers that say, “don’t like abortion? don’t have one!” perhaps during the slavery debate in our country, a similar bumper sticker could have read, “don’t like slavery? don’t own one!” proponents argue that abortion doesn’t affect most people, so people shouldn’t care. it’s between a woman and her doctor. they say that pro-lifers shouldn’t be able to force their worldview down everyone else’s throats. they shouldn’t be able – through legislation – to “force” childbirth on women who don’t want to have babies. so, since the issue isn’t affecting anyone, except the mother – and the baby who doesn’t get a say, but that’s beside the point – it should be left solely up to the woman and her right to do with her body what she wants. (even though the baby isn’t her body.) you could say the same thing about slavery. it didn’t affect anyone except the slave owner – and the slave, but they didn’t view slaves as people then (kind of like how unborn babies aren’t people either) – so, if you didn’t like slavery, good for you. don’t own any. and don’t force your worldview down everyone else’s throats. well, here’s one activist and head of an abortion rights group who’s comparing abortion to slavery. except, she’s arguing that not allowing federal funding for abortion is tantamount to slavery. and allowing federal funding for abortion would be “setting women free.” here’s cns news: kierra johnson, executive director of urge: unite for reproductive and gender equity, testified friday before the house judiciary committee examining the hyde amendment, which forbids the use of federal funds for abortion except in cases of rape and incest, and compared the amendment to slavery, saying that repealing the hyde amendment is about “setting us (women) free.” johnson responded to a question on the impact of the hyde amendment on low-income women, referencing an earlier comment from rep. trent franks (r-ariz.) in which he compared the supreme court’s dred scott decision to abortion, saying, “it’s interesting that we’re bringing up slavery in this space. when you own somebody’s decision-making, you own them.” “the hyde amendment is about increasing coverage of insurance,” she argued. “it is about returning decision-making back to women. it’s about setting us free. “when you get to decide for them whether or not their body has value, you own them whether you decide they’re valuable as black or not, you actually don’t get to make that decision,” johnson emphasized. “we are valuable, and women are valuable. the hyde amendment simply says set us free,” she said. “we are not simple-minded. we are not being duped. women are choosing to be pregnant and have children. the majority of women who have abortions are parents. they care, they care about their families.” “we should repeal the hyde amendment,” she concluded. there should be no federal funding for abortion, period, regardless of how the baby was conceived. in the vast majority of cases, people want abortion for convenience. they want sex without consequences. even in the cases of rape and incest – while those instances are tragic – you don’t punish the baby. it wasn’t the baby’s fault. the baby merely becomes an innocent bystander. instead of punishing the baby, the rapist should be the one to be aborted.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      abortion proponent says taking away federal funding of abortion is slavery      
__label__1 the stated reason the charlotte-mecklenburg police department didn’t release their body cam and dash cam footage of the shooting was that by doing so, it might interfere with the investigation. amid calls from the public and keith scott’s family to release the footage of the shooting, the police have now decided to comply with those demands. police chief kerr putney had been saying that the video footage didn’t show conclusive evidence that scott was holding a gun. neither footage from the dash cam and one of the officers body cams showed it, and the officer who fatally shot scott – brentley vinson, a black man – wasn’t wearing a body camera. graphic video: part of the dash-cam video released by @cmpd #keithscott @twcnewsclt pic.twitter.com/fgaydqpias — christina watkins (@cwatkinstv) september 24, 2016   so, the footage has now been released, but it doesn’t make the incident any clearer. scott is seen very briefly and from no angles that show whether or not he was holding a weapon. what is seen in the video, however, is scott inching backwards right before he got shot. he didn’t appear to be pointing anything at anyone. so, if he had a gun in his hand, he wasn’t aiming at any of the cops. marijuana joint was it necessary for the police to shoot scott? it’s hard to say at this point, since all we have are bits and pieces, and the police report. according to an eyewitness account, scott didn’t have anything in his hand, and he was reading a book. that we know probably wasn’t the case, since the police didn’t recover a book from the scene. and they did recover a handgun and an ankle holster. and a marijuana joint. probably not a book. i’m usually torn with these kinds of shootings. on one hand, i understand that police are on edge when a civilian has a gun. but too often – not necessarily in this case – police overreact and shoot when there really wasn’t a threat. when police do overreact, i don’t think it’s evidence of “racism.” i think it’s evidence that our society is on edge. civilians are afraid that the police will abuse their authority, and the police are afraid that civilians will shoot at them. both sides have issues that need to be resolved, and until that happens, officer-involved shootings will continue.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      charlotte police release footage of shooting [video]

__label__1 donald trump got off to a great start during monday night’s debate, his first presidential debate with hillary clinton. but his performance wasn’t without bumps. so, did trump appear like a legitimate candidate tonight? and did hillary maintain her status as a policy wonk who knows her stuff ? was she able to fend off claims that she is shrill? and what of the moderator? was lester holt a moderator, or was he a third debater and on hilary’s side, at that? this was a very historic debate, certainly. hillary clinton, the first female candidate from a major party, met donald trump, one of the first political neophytes and businessmen to gain the nomination of a major party, are engaged in an election that for many is about all the marbles. many, both left and right, feel that if their candidate doesn’t win it will be a catastrophe for the nation. while democrats feel that if trump wins they may end up in the political wilderness for decades, republicans are equally sure that if hillary wins she will finish the destruction of the nation started by barack obama. what ever might happen in the months to come, this, the first of three debates, did not end trump’s campaign. he held his own well enough against hillary’s wonky demeanor, and was able to stand toe-to-toe with her for the entire 90-minute debate. he also didn’t commit any major gaffes and pulled the reins back on the sort of extreme combativeness we saw from him during his primary debates. but trump missed a lot of opportunities and seemed on the defensive throughout. while he was still forceful and in places combative, trump was able to successfully slam home one message. his main line of attack during the night was that hillary has spent 30 years in government leading this nation with the polices she advocated tonight, yet this nation is failing and our world is more dangerous than ever. donald trump wondered aloud how all her wonderful plans would change anything that she hasn’t been able to change in her 20 years in power? in the end, though, trump did not hurt himself in this debate, something that will surely discourage liberals supporting hillary. it is doubtful that trump lost any supporters even as he may not have picked up any new acolytes. as to hillary, she didn’t get shrill and even once or twice seemed to respond like a real human might. she seemed in command of her ideas and generally kept an even tone. in the final analysis, though, this outing should likely be scored as something of a tie and in that case the challenger might be awarded a bit of a win. after all, this was trump’s first one-on-one presidential debate against a candidate who has been in a dozen of them over two presidential campaigns yet he was able to keep he head about him and say mostly on track with only a few instances where he got bogged down. he’ll likely get even better at this over the next two outings. as to moderator holt, it was clear he bowed to pressure from his pals on the left to become the third candidate on the stage. he constantly interrupted trump and was clearly on hillary’s side throughout the night. by contrast he almost never interrupted hillary. the night started with moderator lester holt opening the debate with questions on the economy. like a democrat does, hillary essentially answered to the question of how she would fix this nation’s faltering economy by unloading yet another laundry list of big government programs. in fact, her entire appeal seemed to be fully centered on democrat tactics of the 1990s. hillary insisted that her tax plan would help small businesses create jobs. and yet, she made this claim only days after releasing her confiscatory estate tax plan that critics say would make sure no family farm or small business could ever be passed down from parent to child because her tax rate is so high that families would have to sell those businesses and farms to pay her 65 percent taxes hit. this sort of uncertainty is not a builder of small business. it is a destroyer of them. when holt turned to trump, the gop candidate went into his familiar “america doesn’t win any more” talking points and added that his tax cut plan would be the biggest since ronald reagan’s and would send the economy booming again. incidentally, this is precisely what hillary’s husband, bill clinton, did in the mid 1990s to reverse the economic disaster he set in motion with his own disastrous tax hike. when he first came to office, bill bowed to the left of his party and raised taxes but after his party was wiped out in the 1994 midterm elections because the economy was sinking under his policies he abruptly changed direction, lowered taxes, and helped bring back national prosperity. this is a lesson hillary obviously has not learned if her high tax policy is any indication. in any case, trump hit over and over on his claim that we need to stop american jobs and businesses from fleeing the country and noted that hillary’s policies are little different than obama’s and that she would not be able to stop jobs from leaving america. incidentally, the segment was another example of lester holt joining team hillary as he insisted calling trump’s tax plan “tax cuts for the wealthy” when in fact his plan would cut taxes for 60 percent of u.s. households. in response, hillary threw out one of her catch phrases calling trump’s policy “trumped up trickle down,” in a tactic again reminiscent of tired old 1990s liberal talking points. the democrat nominee also claimed that her massive tax hike would create 10 million jobs, a claim that is hard to fathom. sadly trump missed the opportunity to note that this is the same lie obama used when he took office and his reputation as a jobs creator is dismal, indeed. trump could have pointed out how hillary’s nonsense is just like obama’s and we have a sluggish economy with millions out of work as a result. another tactic hillary employed early and often throughout the debate was to urge the media to “fact check” trump. this is just a continuation of her coordination with the same media that put out a slew of trump hit pieces three days before the debate. trump went on to hit hillary on the nafta and tpp trade polices as he has been doing for months, now. what ever you feel about nafta, hillary did not mount a very effective response to trump’s accusation and indeed she used a false claim against trump as she did so. hillary insisted that trump cheered the housing crisis when people were losing their homes late in the 2000s. hillary has uttered this lie many times, but even cnn noted that the claim is not true. trump did not celebrate people losing their homes. the issue of trump’s tax returns next came up but trump got the better of hillary with the question and got the crowd to break its pledge of silence at the same time. when the partisan holt asked trump if he’ll release his tax returns, he replied, “i’ll release my tax returns when she releases her 33,000 emails that she deleted.” the crowd erupted in cheers but were then scolded by holt for breaking the silence pledge. hillary’s only real response was to harry reid-like claim that trump doesn’t want to release his taxes because he has never paid any federal taxes at all. however her attack line on trump has been proven incorrect even by the so-called “fact checkers” she kept trying to press into service to go after trump. fact check site politifact has said hillary’s claim that trump paid no taxes is “mostly false.” trump also made some great points when he noted that the u.s.a. is a “serious debtor nation” with an infrastructure that is falling apart and the nation needs a new leader who “has an idea about money.” moderator holt then moved onto the the racial divide and in her answer hillary insisted that america’s police are racists who need re-education. in her opinion, our police are “implicitly biased” against blacks. trump then reminded america that it was hillary who said that blacks were “super predators,” a statement she later had to apologize for. but trump hit a bad spot when asked to once again respond to his former birtherism. trump rambled and was not able to successfully reply to the issue on stage. hillary made herself look petty, though. when she called trump’s birtherism a “racist lie.” whatever you believe about where obama was born, the issue has nothing to do with his race. it has to do with his citizenship. that wasn’t the end of hillary’s name calling. she later directly called trump a racist, as well, for his words against the importation of muslim terrorists. hillary also said trump is anti-woman despite the fact that trump employs more women in high positions than most big new york companies. the attacks gave trump a good opening to reiterate that hillary has spend hundreds of millions of campaign dollars on vicious attack ads on tv, yet despite the expenditure, the two candidates are virtually tied in the polls. the lie about trump being a racist was far from the only lie clinton told this night. clinton also disgorged a series of other lies during the debate. in one case hillary insisted that when she became obama’s secretary of state iran was “weeks away” from having a nuclear bomb. but in truth there is no intelligence estimate from any country that supports her claim. clinton also insisted she was against the trans pacific trade agreement in its early stages. but in fact, hillary called the tpp scheme the “gold standard” of trade agreements and was a major supporter of the plan. so, what did we end up with last night? as noted above, the night was more or less a tie. no one who supports either candidate would have been swayed to abandon their support. neither came away with any knock out blows and both held their own. we move on to round two wondering if we may yet see something that might become a game changer. but the immediate post debate period was interesting in that it showed what sort of candidate trump really is. as is usual for a presidential candidate after a debate, hillary clinton disappeared after waving to supporters. but trump made himself available to the media right away. trump’s talking to sean hannity and other members of the media as he exited the stage marks a first for a presidential candidate and it only goes to highlight the fact that hillary went well over 200 days before speaking to the media while trump has made himself available the whole campaign. so, what did you think of the debate? tell us in the comments below.       debate night gives trump his big shot to look presidential… but did it work?

__label__1 conservative talk show host, author, and founder of the blaze, glenn beck, a fervent supporter of ted cruz during the gop presidential primary, put the texas senator in the hot seat on monday, grilling him over his shocking endorsement of donald trump announced on friday. beck, who is still firmly in the “never trump” camp, grilled cruz from the beginning in an interview that no one will call “softball.” he started out by asking cruz, who was calm and serious during the entire interview, how he could go from “vote your conscience” to now not only announcing that he’s voting for donald trump, but encouraging others to as well. “so am i now suppose to vote for him, or am i supposed to vote my conscience?” beck asked, already showing a tone in his voice that expressed some disdain. “well, glenn, what i said in cleveland and what i would say today is the same thing. you should follow your conscience. and i believe what i laid out in cleveland was don’t stay home and vote your conscience and vote for candidates you trust to defend the constitution. and what i was trying to do in cleveland was lay out a path to uniting republicans and lay out a path to winning. and in particular, i was saying to the trump campaign — ‘this is how you earn my vote and i believe how you earn the vote of other conservatives — you defend freedom and defend the constitution.’ this is about principles and ideas.”  when ted cruz began to explain how hillary clinton is certainly not the person to defend the constitution, glenn beck interrupted, pointing out that we’ve known that “for 25 years,” and noted that when cruz was asked over the weekend whether donald trump is fit to be president, he avoided directly answering the question. “what i said is this is a binary choice — i wish it were not a binary choice,” cruz responded. “you know, i tried very, very hard, as did you, to prevent it from being a binary choice between hillary and donald trump and i think it is fair to say there was no other republican candidate who left more on the field and did more to stop donald from being the nominee than i did. but the voters made a different decision and you have to respect the democratic process even if you may not be terribly happy with the outcome…” “so a man — i just want to make sure i understand — so a man who has principles who says, ‘there are lines i will not cross,’ it’s still a binary choice — so a man who you cannot come on and say, ‘yes, glenn, he is fit to be president of the united states,’ i still am encouraged by you to abandon my principles and vote because it’s a binary choice?” beck asked, interrupting cruz again. “you are encouraged by me to do what you believe is right and honorable and principled,” cruz answered. “and from my perspective, as i look at the issues, hillary clinton is telling us she will do enormous damage to the country,” cruz explained, bringing up issues like filling supreme court vacancies while stating that “every one of our constitutional rights hangs in the balance.” glenn beck said that ted cruz knew these things in july at the republican national convention in cleveland and had previously accused donald trump of being a “sociopathic liar” during the campaign and wondered how voters are now supposed to believe trump when he takes positions on issues. “first of all, i have had many significant disagreements with donald trump, but as you noted i have not been shy to articulate those at considerable length. i don’t intend to do so at this point — the primary is over. we are in a general election with a binary choice and i don’t think it’s beneficial for me laying out those concerns,” cruz answered. again, beck pressed, asking cruz what changed between the convention and now to make cruz change his mind when he could have done so at the convention. ted cruz explained that what changed for him was on friday, the same day cruz made his endorsement announcement, the trump campaign guaranteed him that they would indeed pick from the list of potential supreme court nominees and also added utah senator mike lee , a principled constitutionalist, to the top of the list. “that was not an accident that that occurred,” cruz told beck. “when several weeks ago — when i sat down with mike pence in washington — mike asked me, ‘what would it take to get you on board?’ and for months, i had been telling donald — i’ve been telling the campaign my greatest concern was protecting the constitution, the bill of rights, and the rule of law. i told donald that before the convention, i said that over and over and over again. and when we talked about, ‘well, what could the campaign do to give any degree of reassurance on the constitution and the rule of law, we discussed the supreme court as being one of the great checks protecting the constitution and the rule of law. and the trump campaign committing to nominate from that list was an important change that gave me significant reassurance that helped get me to the point of saying ‘yes.” co-host stu burguiere then asked cruz how he could possibly believe trump’s word on the supreme court or anything else considering his well-documented history of being flimsy with the truth. cruz answered by referring to his endorsement announcement on facebook and explained that it was a decision that he “agonized about,” but that he knew with “one-hundred percent certainty” that hillary clinton would appoint “left-wing ideologues” to the supreme court and that the free speech, the right to bear arms and u.s. sovereignty would likely be eliminated. cruz said that “he hoped” trump would follow through on his commitment since he’s publicly promised to, but there is no way of knowing with certainty if anyone will keep their word. “the fact that he is publicly promising he will nominate from these 21, i think creates a dynamic where compared to hillary who is promising to put left-wing ideologues, that’s a clear choice,” cruz contended. ted cruz then explained that his much-ballyhooed speech in cleveland was unfortunately perceived to mean he was “never trump,” but cruz said that was not actually the case. he revealed that his speech drew upon convention speeches given previously by ted kennedy and ronald reagan during their primary challenges — speeches that were largely considered endorsements of their respective party’s eventual winner. after some contentious back-and-forth between beck and his co-hosts, cruz said that his goal of his convention speech was to move trump closer to defending the constitution and focus on the issues that matter to conservatives and that confirming that he would definitely pick from the supreme court list was pivotal as was trump’s statement last week that he supported cruz’s efforts to stop obama’s internet giveaway. “i was articulating, ‘if you want my vote, defend freedom and defend the constitution,” cruz said. “when donald trump comes in and supports our efforts to defend freedom, that’s significant. does it mean that he will always do so in the future? no, i don’t have certainty of any candidate on that but what i do know is that what hillary is promising to do would do enormous damage — the court would be lost for a generation. and the question of voting your conscience…listen, that is what i have struggled four months prayerfully considering what is the right thing to do.” cruz went on to say that voters had five choices in regards to the presidential election, including voting third-party and not voting period, but that he could not publicly defend those choices because he was always “never hillary,” and the only path he sees to stop her presidency is to vote for donald trump. glenn beck, visibly angry, then skipped the commercial break, a break he said would cost him $20,000, but was well worth it to get in one more question with cruz, which was to ask whether cruz was selling an email list provided to him by glenn beck, to donald trump. cruz answered that in the same way that beck’s radio program sells advertising, cruz — as does every other political campaign — rents their email lists to fund their efforts. he did not say specifically whether any such arrangement had been made with the trump campaign but noted that there is a “hit piece” today by politico, which he called a “left-wing rag,” that is applying a standard to him that they are not applying to any other politician. beck concluded the interview by telling cruz that he strongly disagreed with him on the issue of trump but still respects him as a man. however, after the break, a disgruntled beck suggested that perhaps he shouldn’t have supported the most principled conservative in the primary, but maybe should have supported marco rubio instead based upon him being able to defeat hillary clinton and forgiving his prior stance on illegal immigration and amnesty. “for the very first time i heard ted cruz calculate,” beck said after the commercial break. “and when that happened, the whole thing fell apart for me,” he continued. “and it’s my fault. it’s my fault for believing that men can actually be george washington.” watch full

__label__1 in the wake of the recent rioting and looting in nc, officers at one charlotte police station were in for a heck of a shock when a little black boy came stumbling into the station totally unannounced. even before the child had a chance to speak a word, one officer quickly called over her fellow officers in the station and rushed towards the boy. the horrifying episode for this young boy all started when he was woken up by sirens and helicopters from outside during the riots on tuesday. the riots were happening just outside the boy's window, but naturally he was completely unaware of why any of this was happening, or even what was really happening. the next day, on the way to school, the boy's mother, deanna hooker was playing the radio and the two heard a news report about how several officers were injured in the rioting and attacks. deanna had no idea how much the riots and news of the injured officers had really affected her son. after seeing so much hate in the news in and his surrounding community deanna was rather surprised to hear her son's idea. the boy thought about the riots for days and the impact that they had on him and continued to have on him. he wanted to make an impact himself for those who risk their lives to keep him safe. "he asked me if he could bring the police donuts and give them hugs for all they do," deanna's facebook post read that was later shared by love what matters.  with a little help from his mom he was able to carry out this very kind and meaningful gesture. he wore a sign around his neck that read, "free hugs," and carried in a big donut box. deanna's son walked into the charlotte-mecklenburg police department and gave the officers his two gifts. he didn't just tell one officer about how he felt, he made sure to go around to every single officer to tell them how he felt about the service they do for him and his mother. "it is amazing how much children can teach us during times like this," deanna's post said about her amazing son. this mom should be proud of her son for having such a steady view in such a chaotic world. she deserves some credit as well for having instilled such great values in her amazing son. source: mad world news       cops floored by what is hanging around young black boy’s neck when he walked into the station

__label__1 to anyone paying attention last night it was clear that hillary did not win the debate against trump. sure, trump was brash and he’s not your normal politician, but the fact of the matter is he demolished her on her record in front of the entire country. nevertheless, cnn did their best to make it look like trump lost the debate by publishing rigged polling data. from infowars: a cnn/orc poll released shortly after last night’s debate found that hillary clinton scored a clear victory over her rival donald trump. one problem – the survey sample included 41% democrats compared to just 26% republicans. asked, “who do you think did the best job in the debate – hillary clinton or donald trump?”, 62% of respondents said hillary while 27% said trump. this immediately gave the impression that hillary trounced trump in the debate, and set the standard for the media narrative that it was a bad night for the republican candidate. however, 33% of the people surveyed in the poll identified as independents, 41% identified as democrats, while just 26% identified as republicans. this represents a disparity of 15% between democrats and republicans – meaning the poll was heavily weighted in favor of democrats before the question about who won the debate was even asked.  almost three quarters of the respondents were not republicans and 57% more democrats were asked than republicans. if the sampling was flipped, with 41% of respondents being republican and just 26% identifying as democrats, the outcome would almost certainly have been in trump’s favor.              i think you get the point by now…donald crushed hillary in last night’s debate!       cnn’s post-debate rigged poll busted…here are the real results

__label__1 it was a busy weekend for miscreant islamist scum operating under the imprimatur of the international socialist-islamist axis within america. on saturday, ahmad khan rahami, a new jersey resident and naturalized immigrant from afghanistan, detonated multiple bombs in new york and new jersey. no one was killed, but nearly 30 people were injured. rahami was apprehended three days later in linden, new jersey, after a gun battle with police. also on saturday, 22-year-old dahir adan, a somali muslim who had been living in the united states for the past 15 years, stabbed nine people at a mall in st. cloud, minnesota. according to st. cloud police chief william blair anderson, adan –who was disguised as a security guard at the time of the attacks – “reportedly made references to allah during the attack and asked at least one person whether they were muslim.” dahir was killed by police at the scene. according to the new york times, rahami, the man arrested for the new york and new jersey bombings, became a “completely different person” after a trip to afghanistan, when it is presumed he became “radicalized,” a term used by the press and politicos to describe a muslim who crosses that obscure line from islamic to militant islamist. it has also been reported that rahami made several other trips to pakistan and afghanistan without being detected by the u.s. government. rahami’s father, mohammed rahami, told the press this week that he had reported his son to the fbi as a potential terrorist in 2014, but the agency took no action. while the rahami and adan stories have received wide press coverage, of course we are still being subjected to the usual spin and politically correct propaganda from the press and politicians, which deftly avoids the motive attendant to these attacks – this being that the perpetrators were muslims and were acting based on islamic doctrine. at this point, we’ve now seen several high-profile acts of domestic terrorism perpetrated by muslims wherein communities and law enforcement agencies were previously made aware of the danger posed by these individuals. in all of these cases, nothing was done to mitigate the potential danger. in the case of federal law enforcement, to some extent it stands to reason that organizations such as the fbi and the department of homeland security might be less motivated to counter these threats, since these are under the control of the obama administration, whose agenda includes destabilizing america through an influx of potentially violent muslims and the establishment of insular muslim communities. in a speech to the united nations this week, our bath house refugee-playing statesman president, barack hussein obama, defended increasing globalization and condemned the populist nationalism that has been growing in the west in direct response to the actions of murderous muslim émigrés and refugees. this deportment, which has included the obama administration illegally facilitating the importation of tens of thousands of muslims from unstable, culturally bankrupt islamic nations, has also given rise to such debacles as the 858 people who, according to a new department of homeland security inspector general’s report, were “mistakenly” granted citizenship due to a failure of the federal government’s fingerprint records system, despite having been ordered deported. this is eerily reminiscent of the jihadi training camps known to exist across the continental u.s., but which law enforcement is prohibited from engaging because the islamist groups operating them somewhat conveniently did not make it onto the federal government’s official list of terrorist organizations. tragically, this international socialist-islamist axis of western elites even includes powerful religious leaders such as pope francis, who regularly condemns “hateful acts of terrorism” with one breath while admonishing europeans to “welcome refugees into your homes and communities” (the same refugees who are rioting and raping their way across that continent) with the next. with regard to the united states, this is a component of the agenda calculated to render america irrelevant as a nation of influence on the world stage. the islamists seek global supremacy for their foul doctrine, while the socialists harbor attitudes varying from those which hold that the concept of nations itself is outmoded, to those which characterize the u.s. as last among the old-school imperialist oppressor nations that must be dismantled. a chief stratagem of the latter is of course the idea that racism practiced by those of northern european descent has been the greatest evil of the last thousand years. erik rush’s book on race is bold, daring and needed — now more than ever: “negrophilia: from slave block to pedestal – america’s racial obsession” — just $4.95! it’s a pretty safe bet that the conservative establishment press will have no interest in that upon which your humble commentator has to say regarding these matters from this point forward, since i would start with a moratorium on muslim immigration and the summary expulsion of each and every muslim foreign national in the united states. i would also revoke the citizenship of each and every naturalized muslim american and deport them to their native countries, save for giving them the opportunity to renounce islam in order to escape this fate. these people, as well as the second and third-generation descendants of muslim émigrés, could count on ongoing surveillance to ensure their sincerity. here, obviously, i am dispensing with the subverted notions of constitutionality popularly advanced by the left, as well as political correctness and cultural relativism. islam is not a religion, nor should it be considered such under law; it is a retrograde system ascribed to by barbarians whose company i would typically pass on in favor of an afternoon cavorting with a troupe of lower primates.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      the global socialist-islamist axis in america      
__label__1 hillary clinton appeared on the tonight show with jimmy fallon on monday evening, an appearance which was precipitated by donald trump’s appearance with the late night comic last thursday. both programs were ratings bonanzas with trump’s program averaging a 2.6 rating share and clinton’s program averaging a 2.8 rating share, the best rating the tonight show has had in five months. clinton also scored higher ratings than trump among adults who are between 18-49 with a 0.9 rating vs. trump who garnered a 0.7 rating with this age group. while hillary clinton’s tonight show visit may have marginally defeated trump’s in the ratings war, the program featuring the democratic nominee for president was far less entertaining than that of her republican challenger. with the exception of few moments, such as fallon’s opening the interview by wearing a surgical mask and using hand sanitizer in reference to clinton’s recent bout with pneumonia, the interview was not that funny. fallon also had another good moment when he handed clinton the bag which trump “left in his dressing room” which contained a picture of vladimir putin in a heart shaped frame, a cd of pink floyd’s “the wall” and an actual bag of softballs, a reference to the media accusing fallon of doing a” softball interview “with trump. why the media expects a late night comic to conduct hard hitting interviews is a question for another day. while fallon certainly was trying, clinton did not appear to want to stay within the confines of a humorous exchange for very long. clinton quickly steered a conversation that started off about the importance of her legacy as the first female nominee for president to one where she was attacking trump. she went after trump for “refusing to admit that president obama is an american.” she also criticized him for his past comments where he referred to a federal judge, gonzolo curiel, who is an american of mexican descent as a mexican. clinton also brought up trump’s exchange with the khans, the muslim gold star family who criticized trump’s immigration policy. the irony of clinton’s trump rampage was that she opened her conversation with fallon by saying that she wanted focus on the issues and dispense with the rhetoric. politicians and political candidates appear on entertainment programs to showcase their human side. bill clinton famously played the sax on the arsenio hall show over twenty years ago. clinton missed a tremendous opportunity to connect with the american people on a different level, to show them that she has a sense of humor and that she doesn’t take herself too seriously. last fall, she appeared on saturday live as a bartender in a humorous skit. recently, she appeared on jimmy kimmel live where she famously opened a jar of pickles to demonstrate her health. of course the pickle jar episode is not that funny anymore now that we know that clinton could have been suffering from pneumonia when she taped the program. no one is saying that hillary clinton needed to mess up her hair, but she would have done herself a better service if she treated the jimmy fallon interview as exactly what it was, entertainment. clinton will have an opportunity to go after her opponent in an appropriate forum, namely the upcoming september 26 debate.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      hillary clinton squandered jimmy fallon appearance      
__label__1 barack hussein obama soetoro sobarkah’s muslim convert cia director john brennan has admitted to giving his support to the communist party in the 1976 election. last week, during the congressional black caucus foundation’s annual conference, brennan admitted that he was asked if he had “ever worked with or for a group that was dedicated to overthrowing the us” during his first polygraph test to enter the central intelligence agency. “i froze,” brennan said. “this was back in 1980, and i thought back to a previous election where i voted, and i voted for the communist party candidate.” claiming that he believed the constitution protected free speech, he said he decided to answer truthfully. “we’ve all had indiscretions in our past,” he said. “i would not be up here if that was disqualifying.” “i froze, because i was getting so close to coming into cia and said, ‘ok, here’s the choice, john. you can deny that, and the machine is probably going to go, you know, wacko, or i can acknowledge it and see what happens,'” brennan said. the question brennan was asked came from the 1940 smith act, which “prohibit[ed] certain subversive activities,” among those were overthrow of the us government by force or violence. thus the question that is routinely asked is, “have you ever advocated (either directly or indirectly) the overthrow of any government by force or violence?” “i said i was neither democratic nor republican, but it was my way, as i was going to college, of signaling my unhappiness with the system, and the need for change,” bennan added. “i said i’m not a member of the communist party, so the polygrapher looked at me and said, ‘ok,’ and when i was finished with the polygraph and i left and said, ‘well, i’m screwed.'” brennan then attempted to put the people to sleep regarding their freedoms by stating, “so if back in 1980, john brennan was allowed to say, ‘i voted for the communist party with gus hall’ … and still got through, rest assured that your rights and your expressions and your freedom of speech as americans is something that’s not going to be disqualifying of you as you pursue a career in government.” it’s interesting that mr. brennan would make such a statement considering the cia suspended an employee who refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement on benghazi, wanted to allow benghazi survivors to talk to congress, but kept it classified, is known as a bully, and has continued to help aid america’s enemies in the middle east. we could even point to the fact that man would not even be sworn in on a bible, but rather a copy of the constitution without the bill of rights and that was only after he had the largest number of votes against his confirmation in our history. between 1950 and 1957, many communist party members were indicted and convicted for advocating communism. according to wikipedia: after a ten-month trial at the foley square courthouse in manhattan, eleven leaders of the communist party were convicted under the smith act in 1949.[50] ten defendants received sentences of five years and $10,000 fines. an eleventh defendant, robert g. thompson, a distinguished hero of the second world war, was sentenced to three years in consideration of his military record. the five defense attorneys were cited for contempt of court and given prison sentences. those convicted appealed the verdicts, and the supreme court upheld their convictions in 1951 in dennis v. united states in a 6-2 decision. following that decision, the doj prosecuted dozens of cases. in total, by may 1956, another 131 communists were indicted, of whom 98 were convicted, nine acquitted, while juries brought no verdict in the other cases.[51] other party leaders indicted included claudia jones and elizabeth gurley flynn, a founding member of the aclu. however, june 17, 1957, yates v. united states held unconstitutional the convictions of numerous party leaders in a ruling that “distinguished between advocacy of an idea for incitement and the teaching of an idea as a concept.” however, consider that that new cold war, which has always been going on despite what the media has presented to us, is brewing and should anyone be surprised the brennan, obama and other communist/islamist ideologists are in positions of power? and do you really think they are not out to silence your opposition to you? if you do, then you are a part of the problem.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      cia director john brennan confesses support for communist party      
__label__1 friday morning around 4:00, three men – some of whom were armed – barged in through one of the doors of an atlanta resident’s house. the resident’s co-worker was over for work-related reasons, and when she heard the commotion, she sprung into action, wielding a handgun. the whole episode was caught on surveillance camera that was set up inside the house. the resident’s co-worker unloaded all the rounds from her gun into the intruders’ direction, sending all three of them out the door. one of the intruders even jumped through a glass door. two intruders are still on the loose, and a third one died from his gunshot wounds in the driveway. after the gunfight, the homeowner can be seen calming down his housemate and taking the gun away. in an interview with channel 2, gwinnett county cpl. dean washington reacted to the incident: “she exercised her right to defend her livelihood and property.” he added: “it’s not common that we receive this caliber of surveillance video showing the crime unfold, an actual home invasion.” washington hopes that the surveillance video will also lead to their being able to capture the two remaining suspects: “they’re not wearing anything on their faces so we’re highly anticipating someone watching the evening newscast will recognize these people.” see the surveillance footage here:     the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      caught on video: armed intruders break in house…armed resident responds

__label__1 from the daily caller news foundation: a shooter opened fire at the cascade mall on friday night, killing five people and fleeing the scene of the crime. dozens of police officers are currently searching for the gunman, described as a hispanic man in his 20s or 30s. authorities believe the man acted alone, though it’s possible that he received help, a spokesperson for the patrol, sgt. mark francis, said in a midnight briefing outside the mall. “i’d be extremely diligent and careful if you come in contact with the suspect,” francis warned. “stay indoors, stay secure.” the shooter killed four women in the cosmetics department of a macy’s department store at the burlington shopping center, which is located 65 miles north of seattle. another man suffered critical injuries but passed away saturday morning, sgt. francis said on twitter. the gunman, armed with a long hunting rifle, left before police arrived. the mall was quickly evacuated around 8pm, minutes after the shooting took place. there has been no indication that the event was terror-related, washington state trooper spokeswoman heather axtman told nbc news, adding that the motive remains unclear. “we’re still trying to gather as many witnesses as we can to get more information,” she said. eric mathews, 40, intended to meet his teenage son kai at the mall on friday night, arriving just as the shooting occurred. the two left before the mall was locked down, but four of kai’s friends were stuck inside. “imagine i was late or if he didn’t answer his phone,” mathews told the ny times, referring to his son. “that stuff is running through my mind.” tari caswell was in the macy’s women’s dressing room when she heard the shots, “like four balloons popping,” she told the skagit valley herald. “then i heard seven or eight more, and i just stayed quiet in the dressing room because it just didn’t feel right. and it got very quiet,” she added. the investigation is ongoing, and the fbi has said early saturday morning that it had “no information to suggest that additional attacks,” were planned in washington state. this is the second attack at a u.s. shopping mall in less than a week. last saturday an assailant stabbed nine people at a mall in st. cloud, minn. before an off-duty police officer intervened.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      five dead in washington state mall shooting      
__label__1 the fbi just released its second batch of documents friday, including notes from their various interviews with state department officials, such as hillary’s closest aides huma abedin and cheryl mills. according to these newly-released documents, president obama used a pseudonym when communicating by email with hillary clinton when she was secretary of state. from politico: in an april 5, 2016 interview with the fbi, abedin was shown an email exchange between clinton and obama, but the longtime clinton aide did not recognize the name of the sender. “once informed that the sender’s name is believed to be pseudonym used by the president, abedin exclaimed: ‘how is this not classified?'” the report says. “abedin then expressed her amazement at the president’s use of a pseudonym and asked if she could have a copy of the email.” the state department has refused to make public that and other emails clinton exchanged with obama. lawyers have cited the “presidential communications privilege,” a variation of executive privilege, in order to withhold the messages under the freedom of information act. the state department hasn’t released the contents of the emails between the president and secretary of state. the one that was shown to abedin had the subject heading ‘re: congratulations.’ it was dated june 28, 2012. politico speculates that it could have been in reference to the supreme court ruling on a particular part of the obamacare law. interestingly, president obama had told reporters a little over a year ago that he had no idea the former secretary of state used a private email server for official matters (even though he had been emailing her private address under a pseudonym). he said he learned about it “the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.” what do you think obama’s pseudonym was?    the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      fbi: obama used pseudonym in emails with hillary

__label__1 in a scathing interview in which he admits he will be cast by democrats of not being a “team player,” the man who was america’s first black governor, democrat douglas wilder, accused the democrat party of taking black voters for granted, said blacks are no better off after eight disappointing years of obama, and that hillary clinton can’t win the white house running on a message that she’s the second worst person in the world (assuming donald trump is the first). perhaps equally embarrassing for hillary clinton, douglas wilder praised republican donald trump’s recent outreach to black voters, giving him credit for doing it even if it lacks authenticity. “the african american community has not been served,” wilder, who was elected to be virginia’s governor in 1989 told the washington post on thursday, a reference to the obama administration. “don’t piss on me and tell me it’s raining!” he said, noting that obama should “admit it” rather than telling black americans “to quit whining when they’re asked for legitimate grievances to be addressed.” “i’m entitled to my criticism of obama because i was one of the first people to support him,” he told the post. in regards to hillary clinton, wilder said that she needs to do more than just paint herself as not as bad as donald trump, but used harsh language to make his point. “let’s assume (trump) is the worst guy in the world. fine. what makes you better? because you’re not considered the worst, but right next to it!” wilder, clearly no fan of donald trump’s either, said that he’s a “huckster” and is “good at it,” but nevertheless applauded his outreach to black voters. “whether it’s genuine or legitimate or not, at least he’s doing it,” he said. “either way, i think it’s good.” wilder said that even after eight years of obama, the country is still in a “mess” and that hillary clinton needs to be much more specific on ideas and policy positions she has to make things better and said that she has “blundered” by making the election a “referendum on donald trump.” “when i ran for office, i never mentioned my opponent’s name. i always said, ‘vote for me for these reasons,” wilder said. douglas wilder has always been outspoken and politically incorrect, which is refreshing. it would be interesting to see what the country would look like if he’d have been the first black president the past eight years instead of obama.  email subscribe      the hardest-hitting political news.

__label__1 the children of abraham of the southern tier, an interfaith organization in johnson city, has taken offense at the 9/11 memorial raised in the nearby town of owego, new york. this association of misguided multiculturalists and muslim moderates allege that identifying the perpetrators of the worst individual act of aggression on american soil would encourage muslim hatred, never once excoriating the very act that resulted in the death and injury to more than 3,000 american victims and 453 responders and boundless grief for their families and for all americans. did the moderates ever attempt to apologize for the horrific crime that forced people to jump to their death rather than be burned alive? did they express their sorrow for the victims and heroic rescue workers, or atone in a way to benefit the families that suffered such tragic loss? do they even acknowledge that islamic terrorists continue their march of evil, putting america and europe on high alert for 9/11, or that this was part of islam’s perpetual holy war against every living being on the planet. no. and the city manager’s overtures were also snubbed. the muslim residents of johnson city may be moderates who never take up a lethal weapon for allah, but they are engaging in a subtle act of civilizational or settlement jihad. such people are comparatively discreet in western society, going about their lives inconspicuously, but effecting regime changes in gradual increments. by their refusal to acknowledge the obvious links between islam and 9/11, they shield those who spew hatred against america, israel and democracy; they empower the academics and students who vilify israel and jewish students on campus, and they facilitate the crossing of borders for hijra (conquest by increased population). under the guise of injured sensibilities, they insist on the removal of anything that may identify those who pursue our destruction and conquest with islam, hoping to erase the ugly truth that fourteen centuries of barbarism continues unabated in every country where islam is found. they would have us believe that a tiny minority is to blame, but a recent pew research poll shows that 51 percent of american muslims choose to be governed by sharia; 30% believe it is legitimate to use violence against those who insult muhammed, the koran, or islam; 25 percent believe violence against americans can be justified as part of the global jihad; and nearly 20% believe the use of violence in the us is justified in order to make sharia the law of the land. when presented with a choice when sharia conflicts with the us constitution and bill of rights, 33% say sharia should be supreme. that’s some minority! politically, 48% are democrats, 19 percent independents, and 19 percent republicans. islam already regulates our speech through our government, our media, and the constant hazard of being damned as islamophobic to those who dare to speak up. they cover their tracks through leftist academics, a strong bds movement, and textbooks crammed with indoctrinal and fallacious material. continuing along those lines, the johnson city assemblage is working to remove from future knowledge the history of 9/11 that was carved into the granite. if we fail to yearly observe significant events as the bombing of the world trade center, the signing of our declaration of independence, our victory in world war ii, and more, our youth will be robbed of their identity, their heritage, and america as we know it. wisdom is defense. ignorance of our journey through history is the greatest threat to our survival. it should be noted that this interfaith group’s complaint was not that they, too, should have paid homage to america’s fallen or, specifically, to owego’s citizen, derek statkevicus, who lost his life that day. neither were they inspired to erect a monument in their own city or to join owego residents in a fight against the greatest scourge of mankind with its unspeakable crimes done in the name of their religion. rather, they express a phony outrage that the criminals have been identified with islam! often enough, other islamic groups attempt to blame 9/11 on american citizens, on jews or christians, but this one is working to eliminate the obvious first, to claim that the 19 were unknown, came out of nowhere, and bombed america for no specific reason. removing the offensive truth from the monument will leave room for revisionism later, just as major nidal hassan (fort hood massacre) was called anything but what he was, and his jihad massacre was officially named “workplace violence.” instead of condemnation or owning up to the demands for death inherent in the koran, these individuals hope to gradually erase the event from our memory and from generations to come – just as islamists have obliterated or renamed many artifacts and historic tombs to create their own narrative, just as their counterparts in israel are trying to stop archaeological excavations from revealing more of jewish history. these children of abraham may well be the islamic families that escaped tyranny but, unfortunately for the rest of us, they nurture their children with intolerance and harshness, creating a new, young generation of jihadists. these offspring may become the young men enticed online to join isis’ executioners, or the young women lured to sexual slavery for the palestinian cause. we must continue to remind ourselves of the anger, the tears, and the patriotism that were triggered that day of september 11th, fifteen years ago, and realize that we are in more danger now than ever before. the middle east has grown bolder and more violent. islamists are acquiring newer, deadlier weapons, and more of their numbers are making their way into europe, north and south america, bringing with them new plans to terrorize and infuse their way of life into ours. islam has been at war with the world since the seventh century. their holy book is a dedication to brutality and conquest, so that even their own people are condemned to grope in the darkness of oppression and poverty. in the name of their god, they must erase the past to support their own supersessionist narrative, and we must never oblige them. the more that americans accommodate such requests and attempt to correct or crush our own speech, the more power we will hand to them. unless we weigh the long-term ramifications of the growing adjustments we make to our lives for the sake of theirs, we will lose our freedoms to their tyrannical sharia laws. in the words of hassan al-banna, creator of the muslim brotherhood (1929), “it is the nature of islam to dominate, not to be dominated, to impose its laws on all nations and extend its laws to the entire planet.” if the hate feared by the children of abraham does arise, it will be because of islamists’ deeds, not the attribution on a memorial stone.       engraved in stone – liberals try to tear down 9/11 memorial!

__label__1 matt lauer is being skinned alive by the leftwingnut media for his honest presidential forum with hillary and trump.  they are calling for his head on a platter for asking hillary about her email crimes. the rightwing saw the interview as a surprise since leftists normally do their utmost to shield hillary and avoid exposing her crimes.  but then they saw that lauer didn’t go into as much detail as they would have and that he did go after trump, but not to the degree with which leftist fanatics would have and that has sent those leftwingnuts over the edge.  in the coming debate between trump and hillary they are calling on their moderators to “fact check” trump, but not hillary. the purpose of journalism is to inform you of events.  you are then free to decide your opinion of those events.  opinions expressed in the media are supposed to be from either the public or the editors.  but that is not what the leftist media practices today.  remember the 2nd romney-obama debate?  the moderator took over debating romney and backed obama’s lie that he said the assassination of ambassador stevens was a terror attack.  even though she admitted she lied the next day the damage was done. i am not a journalist.  i have a degree in journalism, but that doesn’t make me a journalist.  i do not work for the media and i do not report the news.  i am a blogger.  i do not report events.  i express my opinion of events.  before you read my articles i expect you to already know the ‘who, what, when, where, and how’ of events.  if you are ignorant because you listen to the leftwingnut media spin then you will probably think my opinion is wrong because you think my facts are lies.  there are leftwingnuts who have chastised bloggers as false because we express our opinions, as if by doing so that makes what we say not the truth.  expressing your opinion of an event does not make the facts of that event a lie – except in the narrow minds of ignorant liberals. i have also been chastised that i do not make good arguments because i am not politically correct and considerate of people’s feelings.  i’m from the forrest gump/larry the cable guy school of education and believe that “stupid is as stupid does” and “you can’t fix stupid.”  intelligent people will learn from what i write and if they are ignorant of the facts i present they will take the time to learn.  the difference between ignorance and stupidity is that ignorance is a lack of knowledge that can be amended through education.  stupidity is an inability to learn, whether accidentally or purposely, and cannot be cured, but must be defeated.  the reason we have obama is because stupid people believed what he said rather than examined his background and elected him on the basis of lies. back in the eighties, i stopped watching television news when i realized all of it was biased anti-reagan bs.  reagan undid the fairness doctrine that democrats had inflicted on media back under truman so that they could control the media’s content.  with that boot lifted of the throats of conservatives there arose the rightwing media led by rush limbaugh and fox news.  rush has been a godsend expressing the opinions of the silent majority that had not permitted to speak over the airwaves.  add to that a network that not only reported events, but had both sides express their opinions and the moral majority not only had a voice once again, but was able to debate with liberals openly so that both sides could be heard together!  that’s why leftists want to reinstate the fairness doctrine to shut us down and silence us again.  it’s not about making the internet fair, it’s about censoring what is right and true. this is the dirty little secret that the left doesn’t want people to know, which is why they say fox news lies about everything.  whenever someone actually watches fox and the democrat media side-by-side they discover that the left is a pack of looney lies and they can get far more of the truth and good sense from fox.  even listening to liberals on fox trying to twist the truth in their arguments with conservatives reveals their ideology to be based on deception. but trump’s relentlessness has forced the left to come out from under their cover as supposed journalists and reveal themselves to be nothing more than democrat propagandists.  the result is that the people no longer trust the media. tmz’s harvey levin declares media made themselves irrelevant cnn busted inserting words trump didn’t say to make him look racist cnn edits out hillary calling ny terror attacks “bombings” like trump read more… visit, like, and share my facebook page – the left is never right subscribe to ipatriot.com to see more of my articles.  stay informed!       leftwing media eat their own as american journalism dies      
__label__1 three significant events occurred on capitol hill this week. john stumpf, ceo of wells fargo, was grilled by the senate banking committee over unethical and potentially illegal account management practices at his bank. john koiskinen, head of the irs, appeared before a house impeachment hearing to answer for destruction of evidence and obstruction charges from house republicans. we also saw heather bresch, mylan ceo, appear before another house committee in response to an investigation into the flurry of epipen price gouging accusations. in each case, the common response from the senior person in charge was, “i take full responsibility for . . .”, followed by a delineation of the problems, excuses and diversionary issues that are obvious to anyone looking at their particular quandary. yes, ceo stumpf was responsible for the actions of wells fargo bankers who opened 2 million fake accounts. he was, in fact, the ceo, and those individuals all reported up through his aor (area of responsibility). yes, director koiskinen did head up and was responsible for the irs during a time when cogress was reviewing the practice of delaying conservative non-profit tax determinations and destruction of evidence under subpoena in the irs. the individuals who trashed hard drives, delayed foia requests and pled the 5th in response to sincere congressional inquiries did, in fact, report up to him. yes, ms. bresch is responsible for the entirety of pricing decisions and financial results at mylan as its ceo. whoever determined that the epipen should be repriced up to $800 from $300, when mylan holds the sole injection delivery patent and can produce the only generic option, did, in fact, work in the organization for which ceo bresch was responsible. what was largely ignored in each of their congressional inquiries is the difference between responsibility and accountability. one can be responsible for overseeing the actions of those who report to them, but being accountable is a completely separate issue. for too long, and in too many positions of leadership, particularly in the public, non-market sector, the person in charge who was ‘responsible’ has not been held accountable. it’s well documented how difficult it is to fire a federal employee, despite how many hours they spent watching porn in their cubicle, or how many va appointment records they falsified. the private sector and it’s free-market mechanisms are more effective at isolating accountability to individuals. however, it is is equally well-documented that a corporate firing normally comes attached with a public statement of ‘early retirement’ and a comfortable golden parachute to soften the landing for the exited executive. rarely, are corporate and public leaders truly held accountable for the actions and results over which they are responsible. as senator warren delivered her strong and rightful rebuke of stumpf, it should be noted that she could similarly be asked, “where are my promised $2500 savings from obamacare?, “why did i have to give up my doctor on passage of the aaca?”, “how do you explain the $20 trillion in national debt my as yet unborn grandchildren now own?”, “why is the va still mistreating our veterans?”, etc. it’s easy to be ‘responsible’ for something . . . once elected or landed in position, to sit in a corner office and collect a nice paycheck and guaranteed pension, while telling someone else what to do, all the while hiding behind bureaucracy, complicated regulations and processes, human resources and legal staffs, and corporate and government committees. it’s far different to be ‘accountable’, and made to personally and individually own the results of the actions which occurred on one’s watch or direction. one might define bureaucracy as the textbook example of ‘responsibility with accountability.” if so, then the reverse would be ‘accountability without responsibility”, which many would say is what happened to the fired bankers at wells fargo. some would also describe that as terrifying. america at its best functioned under the idea of individual responsibility – hard work, gaining an education, making wise choices, providing for oneself and family, pursuing the american dream, and being a productive member of your community and society. under individual responsibility, one has to own the results of their actions, accept accountability – consequences – for their shortfalls and mistakes, and then decide how to move forward. a running back, given responsibility to hold onto the football, who has a fumbling problem will find himself experiencing the consequence (accountability) of getting to sit on the bench. a bank robber who takes the responsibility of relieving the local branch of their cash will normally be held accountable for their actions in a federal penitentiary. as the ideas of collective responsibility, corporatism and crony capitalism have taken root – closely tied to the expanding power of the public sector, in government, academia and the closely-aligned media, and the growing interconnectedness of private and public enterprise – individuals are absolved of the consequences of their individual actions and can hide behind the system, the process, the complexities, the nuanced views, and the collective weight of administrative machinery that grinds down any effort to reward or place accountability on the individual. the private sector retains many aspects of individual responsibility, as we saw this week in the willingness of mr. stumpf and ms. bresch to appear before the inevitably-hostile congressional panels. they made gallant efforts to defend their respective corporate positions, knowing they would have a board of directors to report back to, and legal departments anxious to avoid class-action suits based on their ceo’s public comments. in each case, though, neither stumpf, koiskinen or bresch understood the notion of accountability. saying ‘i’m sorry this happened’ isn’t enough. saying ‘we’ll make it right’ doesn’t cut it. promising that ‘we’ll do better next time’ is a hollow statement. yes, they should each be sorry and filled with personal sorrow. let’s hope they are sincere in the promising of refunding fees and repairing the shattered credit of thousands. let’s even assume they’ll fix the 501c3 application process, quit destroying records under subpoena, and make the price of life-saving epipens affordable to every family. those are all actions for which they are responsible, they control the budgets, organizations, plans and activities of their enterprises,and as the senior leaders, they can personally make those actions happen. there’s still the matter of accountability . . . consequences. mr. stumpf, careers were ruined and lives were thrown into turmoil by the actions of wells fargo, for which you were responsible and, not coincidentally, you and many others profited enormously. mr. koiskinen, you allowed the irs to subvert the will of the people to oversee and correct the oppressive actions of the government’s most-feared agency, while retaining your position, power and pension. ms. bresch, under your watch and your authority, mylan took advantage of countless families with no other options, earning millions for your company and yourself. you were all responsible. now, how will you be held accountable? that remains to be seen. even among our most revered and senior leaders, responsibility is rarely joined with accountability. hillary ‘took responsibility’ for the benghazi disaster and deaths of four americans, her home-brew email server spewing classified secrets, and forgetting scores of classified briefings. now she’s running for president. four brave americans were accountable and took on the consequence for our potential future president’s actions or indecision. spare us for thinking that personal accountability is a rare concept in 21st century america.       responsibility isn’t accountabilty

__label__1 before the debate has begun, clinton has been out-trumped. apparently clinton will have billionaire mark cuban sitting in the front row of the debate. some believe this move would intimidate trump, though the two billionaires don’t really have much of a past together. cuban recently challenged trump to a “sit down” to discuss policy for 4 hours with no clinton-bashing. if trump accepted, cuban agreed to donate $1 million to charity. why cuban has decided to jump in the presidential fray, since he is as significant in the discussion as navel lint. one might believe that with the ineffectiveness of hillary clinton’s “not so secret weapon,” bill clinton, that cuban has become her surrogate. other than ignore cuban, if i were trump, i would have donated $1 million to my own charity, then proclaimed victory over cuban. my statement would be, “mark cuban is a publicity seeker who needs me to be relevant.” as for hillary clinton bringing cuban, this strategy will backfire. to some degree it already has, as in trump’s response, hillary clinton has already been out-trumped. as reported by the washington post: gennifer flowers, who revealed a sexual relationship with bill clinton in the 1990s, is saying she will attend monday night’s debate between donald trump and hillary clinton as trump’s guest. flowers’s assistant confirmed the decision to buzzfeed’s andrew kaczynski saturday afternoon, and flowers herself told the new york times in a text message, “yes, i will be there.” the decision was the latest play in a bizarre bit of gamesmanship between the clinton and trump campaigns over the debate. clinton’s camp confirmed this week that it would invite billionaire mogul mark cuban, a trump antagonist, to the debate. first, cuban is insignificant. it would be different if trump hadn’t already marginalized cuban. cuban said trump wasn’t wealthy, then later retracted the statement after more careful examination of trump’s finances. cuban is kooky. sure he’s successful, but not as successful as trump. next, by bringing in cuban, hillary clinton opened herself up for lots of damage. trump has already responded by bringing in jennifer flowers, a move sure to open more moves. but this may be only the beginning. but trump has many more “mind-screws” he can do on hillary and it can all happen before the debate. for example, trump could invite anita broderick, and reference her when hillary discusses the war on women. he could invite linda tripp, and have linda appear with the infamous “blue dress.” or trump could go for the jugular and invite monica lewinsky. perhaps trump could invite the families of the benghazi victims, or a few bernie or bust supporters. hillary clinton has let the genie out of the bottle, and this genie is not her friend. hillary clinton has out-trumped herself.       hillary clinton out-trumped before debate

__label__1 in a day and age when government and media are larger than ever, an america-loving citizen has discovered what the department of justice and mainstream media have been unable (or unwillingly) to un-earth: proof that hillary  clinton conspired to cover up her “un-wise” use of a private server and email scandal. through the power of social media, a twitter user @goppollanalyst has pieced together compelling evidence that has reached the house oversight committee who have begun a new investigation. paul combetta, the it specialist hired by hillary clinton during her time as secretary of state, allegedly solicited advice on how to remove hillary’s name from classified emails. he made his requests from the public at large through the popular message board reddit under the screen name “stonetear” throughout the summer and fall of 2014 and left more than a few definitive breadcrumbs. in his requests for help from the public at large, combetta asked for technical advice on how to save or delete old emails as well as how to remove email addresses of an “unamed vip client” from email servers and archives. “hello all,” one of the posts begins. “i may be facing a very interesting situation where i need to strip out a vip’s (very vip) email address from a bunch of archived email that i have both in a live exchange mailbox, as well as a pst file. basically, they don’t want the vip’s email address exposed to anyone. … does anyone have experience with something like this, and/or suggestions on how this might be accomplished?” the house oversight committee has begun an investigation and has asked reddit to save all relevant posts and data. where that investigation goes is unclear but what is clear is that the american citizenry has uncovered what the crooked media and politicians have attempted to cover-up and have been unwilling to publish: proof of hillary’s clinton’s criminal activity. the investigation will likely pivot based on a very simple question: is the screen name “stonetear” definitively combetta? in not, the evidence is circumstantial. if so, the proof is indisputable and ties a direct line between hillary clinton and a clearly illegal cover-up. to support the argument that “stonetear” is in fact hillary clinton’s it specialist, @goppollanalyst has unearthed the following connections: this story has not been widely reported and likely will not as media outlets have little incentive to highlight an average american doing their job for them. as word of this discovery spreads and the evidence presented throughout this post is presented to the house oversight committee, the work of the american people, both as investigators like @goppollanalyst and as citizen-journalists like the authors here at ipatriot, will not remain silent.

__label__1 this very week, when americans were shaken by yet several more violent attacks across the nation by radical muslim terrorists, we as a nation were shocked and numbed in disbelief by plans still firmly in place by the obama administration to bring in 110,000 muslim refugees from the middle east this year. hillary clinton, on the stump campaigning for president, vows to increase those numbers of poorly vetted muslim immigrants to more than 620,000 her first year in office if elected. the stark raving madness of such plans is unfathomable. it is a widely known fact that there is no means of screening this huge wave of muslim immigrants to determine which among them are radical extremists and thus potential terrorists. nor do we have any database to screen them for potential criminals or with criminal pasts. additionally we have no means to screen them to learn whether or not they are willing to assimilate into the mainstream culture and values of american life. yet inexplicably, both barack obama and hillary clinton are deadly serious in their hardened determination to bring these 600,000-plus muslim immigrants to america at the very time that deadly acts of terrorism are on the increase by radical muslims on american soil. the number one job of the us president is to keep our citizens safe and secure. yet to both american citizens in the various states and local communities, as well as among state and local elected officials it is increasingly obvious that security and safety is rapidly vanishing and that we are in “clear and present danger”. the governors of at least two dozen states have forcefully opposed the immigration and resettlement of muslims, not only because of the “no questions asked” open door policy, but also due to proven incidents of crime and violence by muslim immigrants who were resettled by obama in twin falls, idaho, minneapolis, minnesota, new england and elsewhere. this week texas governor greg abbott flatly declared his firm refusal to resettle any additional mideast muslim immigrants in texas, citing the potential dangers to american citizens and texas residents for outright defiant refusal. while more than two dozen states, led again by texas have sued the obama administration for various and egregious abuses of power and unconstitutional executive overreaches meddling in state and local matters, the action this week by texas governor abbott consisted of an outright, defiant refusal. as a writer with a strong knowledge of american history, the constitution and the workings of government, governor abbott’s action on behalf of texas this week strongly suggests the invoking of the tenth amendment protecting states’ rights, and thus the principle of nullification of unconstitutional federal acts against states. the nullification principles have been debated in terms of scope and circumstantial legality at various times since before the civil war. for decades after union victory nullification of unlawful federal action, as well as secession from the union, appeared to be settled as illegal. however, the southern states resurrected the issues of nullification and secession during the battle over civil rights and racial integration in the 1950s and 60s. given the “moral high ground” advantage owned by the feds at the time the notion of nullification gained little political steam. the past eight years of the obama administration, which has wrought untold misery to americans though both disastrous policies and increasingly lawless and unconstitutional executive actions, has revived the tenth amendment, states’ rights issue and the principle of nullification of unlawful federal actions by one or more states has been resurrected with a vengeance. with radical islamic terrorism spreading like wildfire around the world, including europe and now in america, local officials and governors in over half the states are frantically working to find legitimate means to protect citizens and preserve the rule of law. even the two centuries old “checks and balances” in three separate branches of government no longer apply; for two years the gop majority in congress utterly refused to check and limit the dangerous, lawless overreach of obama’s executive branch, and numerous federal courts, including the supreme court have also failed to limit executive branch lawlessness. the astounding rise of donald trump, the tea party, the open revolt against “washington political establishment, along with the widely understood tyrannical executive actions by obama that go unchallenged, state governors are banding together to fight federal tyranny. on the “frontier strip” an organization called “free nebraska” has led the way in partnership with similar movements in other states, to call for the convening of a”convention of states”. it appears very likely when analyzing these related events in clear resistance to dangerously growing federal power and control over issues that are in the prerogative of individual states, that the highly unusual and noteworthy action of the governor of texas to directly confront the federal government and mr. obama, that state-by-state nullification actions and declaring state government sovereignty under the “reserve clause” (powers reserved to the states)of the tenth amendment is a growing conflict. knowing the tyrannical nature of the federal government, the growing power struggle escalating into a states’ rights nullification battle involving potentially a score or more of state governors is certain to quickly turn ugly and potentially violent. given the precarious political situation and this presidential election the most consequential in american history, a nullification battle involving states’ rights to limit and push back against federal tyranny, the nullification battle begun by texas appears very likely to further divide america as some state governments rebel and other states acquiesce. let us pray to our lord that freedom will be restored peacefully. however an already deeply divided america is being further divided and clearly leading to open rebellion, we must also pray for avoidance of civil insurrection. the stark reality however, is that federal tyranny is clearly headed toward dictatorship, and the bitter but forced choice between liberty and tyranny will result in a ferocious struggle to restore american liberty and the outcome, while uncertain, is just as clearly leading to a historical confrontation and bitter conflict. may god bless america as we endeavor to confront and defeat the tyranny in washington, d.c. freedom comes with a price; to restore freedom to america that price will be high. let us pray to almighty god that he will empower us to overcome the monstrous evil we now face, and fight.       has texas begun their “war for independence”?

__label__1 a chat with the devil the share of the small business market is dwindling. almost all the sectors of the economy suffer – grocery stores, factories, small farms, etc. the negative impact is obvious in many aspects. we can pay visits to small towns and the abandoned and boarded stores as we tour their dead downtowns. talk to farmers, who live in poverty on their 100-acre farms. they are looking for jobs. the corporate farms, which have the money to influence politicians, push for regulations that the small farmers can’t afford. the neo-lords drive them out and buy more and more of their land turning them into peasants. [read related article: who are the neo-lords?] small business is the biggest creator of jobs. the middle class in america is suffering as a result of the elite-businessmen influencing legislation that destroys small business, and when they move their factories out of the country, they take what’s left of the jobs with them, leaving destruction in their wake. high taxes and other policies hurt big business, but kills small business. the increasing wealth in the hands of big business makes them more competitive. the foreign-made products that need cheap labor are welcome in the country since it is produced by our big business-men. they can move their factories abroad, while a small business can’t. on the other hand, pharmaceutical companies, which do not need cheap labor, operate in america. they are left to abuse the market by enjoying the ban on medicines made abroad from entering the country. the government decided that medicines made in england, germany, france, japan, etc. can’t be sold in the united states. ironically, some medicines produced in america are sold to chinese patients for a fraction of what they charge american patients. in fact, china negotiated recently further drug price cuts with our patriotic companies, lowering the prices for the chinese in some cases, to less than 50%. now, let’s sneak under the table and listen to a conversation between two elite businessmen… one is a tycoon and the other is his young protégé: – we will make the lake deeper; we can fish with our big boats, and they will drown with their small boats. – what do you mean? – we will make the government build extra infrastructure that benefits our big business and kills the small business. – don’t they pay more taxes than we do? the government will use that money to help us kill them? – yes, we’ll put them out of business using their own money. now, their customers are ours; we swallowed the market. – oh, it looks like some of them survived! – not for long – we’re getting bigger, we can sell cheap. 10% profit is good for us, but for a small business owner, it wouldn’t even feed his kids. – we did it. they are out of business….wait a minute, the relatively bigger ones are still in business! – hmm….a free trade agreement will finish them….we will tell the government to sign a couple of these agreements. the manufacturers can’t compete with the products made by the slaves in china. – how about us? would we be able to compete with the chinese products? – for sure, no. but you know what? we can move our business to china. they can’t do that. they are too small to do it. – it looks like with the cheap merchandise sold by some of the small service businesses are flourishing. – not for long. they will boom, then after some time they will die. as we keep closing the factories, we will keep firing workers. these jobless workers will have no money to spend, and the market will diminish. – wouldn’t that hurt us as well? – yes and we’ll be bankrupt. – how would this be good for us? – did you forget that the politicians are ours? the government will bail us out. – with tax money paid by the people whom we fired? – yes, and the government will feed the smaller business to the bigger one. we will buy them, and the government will pay. – wouldn’t this mean that we have to downsize? – precisely, and we fire more workers. – you mean the workers who paid the taxes that the government used to buy the smaller business for us that they used to work for? – yes, we kill them with their own sword. we starve them and their children with their own money. – we have a democrat president and a republican congress. which one will help us? – both. they are ours. one would decide and the other would approve. after they yell at the executives and box their ears. – the market is smaller now, what are we going to do? – no harm. if the middle class is diminishing in america, it is growing in china. what we lose here, we’ll gain there. – don’t you feel bad for america and the americans? – ah… i feel good for my money. we used to be british, now we are americans, and soon we’ll be chinese. the king doesn’t care which kingdom he is ruling.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      a chat with the devil

__label__1 a 22-year-old muslim man from afghanistan proudly declared that he was a superstar in afghanistan after he sodomized and orally raped a 2-year-old boy. the worst part is that he was only charged with sexual assault and only sentenced to two years in prison. the uk’s express reports: jama b., 22, showed no remorse as he was sentenced to just two years and four months behind bars on the milder charge of sexual abuse of the four-year-old boy at the centre in boostedt, schleswig-holstein. the toddler, from iraq, was lured into a toilet cubicle at the home in march this year. the court heard the afghani forced his penis into the child’s mouth. afterwards the distraught youngster was returned to his father with his trousers down around his ankles. during the trial jama b. boasted: “i’m a superstar in afghanistan, a singer.” … judge stefan becker refused to comment on the verdict but peter boysen, the lawyer who represented the family of the child, said: “it was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child. “therefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. i have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. he’s better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist. jama showed absolutely no remorse for his crime. a second man, sohrab s., 29, allegedly stood guard outside the toilet during the assault, which was really rape. he was acquitted for lack of evidence. prosecutor axel bieler said, “rape charges are brought only if it was enforced with violence or the threat of violence. we do not assume this was the case. “therefore he was indicted on a charge of serious sexual abuse. the penalty doesn’t matter – it is between two and 15 years in jail for rape or for serious sexual abuse.” say what? how about the fact that it was forced and that it was upon a child? what kind of mind does axel bieler have? i can tell you it is not a critically thinking judicial mind for sure. karin witt is not better. the spokeswoman of the kiel court said, “the court found no reasons for an increased penalty, such as for example a criminal record for the accused. “the fact that he was under the influence of alcohol and the high sensitivity towards detention of the offender were both factors in the sentence,” she added. “he is young, knows no german and has already been attacked in pre-trial detention. the victim has also dealt well with the experience of what happened to him and there are no serious consequences to be expected.” what’s even worse is the comments by the family’s attorney. “it was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child,” peter boysen said. “therefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. i have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. he’s better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist. really, mr. boysen? how about if this was your little boy? would you still have the same cold-hearted response at this crime? i think not. germans were outraged at the charges and the sentencing. “the incredible verdict of the prosecutor and the court,” wrote the bild am sonntag newspaper.  “this is the verdict that shames you all.” people continuing to make excuses for criminal sexual crimes, especially for those who are most innocent among us are a part of the larger problem. allowing the foreign god of islam in what was once a christian country is problematic enough. excusing the pagans that practice the ideology of muhammad and engaging in these kinds of crimes is just adding fuel to the fire. don’t think it won’t be happening in the united states either. our own military kicked out sgt. charles martlandfor defending a boy that was raped in afghanistan and told other members of our military to keep silent about such abuses. do you really think our representatives are going to stand up for the children when they’ve allowed them to be slaughtered by the millions? i think not. in a biblical society, this man would have been put to death, and rightly so. reposted with permission from freedom outpost  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      muslim afghani rapes 2-year-old, gets 2 years in prison…declares himself ‘superstar’      
__label__1 on saturday, september 17 at 8:30 pm est, an explosion rocked west 23 street in manhattan, in the neighborhood commonly referred to as chelsea, injuring 29 people, smashing windows and initiating street closures. there were no fatalities. officials maintain that a homemade bomb, which had been placed in a dumpster, created the explosion. the explosive device was removed by the police at 2:25 am and was sent to a lab in quantico, virginia for analysis. a second device, which has been described as a “pressure cooker” device similar to the device used for the boston marathon bombing in 2013, was found on west 27th street between the avenues of the americas and seventh avenue. by sunday morning, all 29 people had been released from the hospital. the chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident saturday morning in seaside heights, new jersey where a bomb exploded in a trash can along a route where thousands of runners were present to run a 5k marine corps charity race. there were no casualties. by sunday afternoon, law enforcement had learned that the ny and nj explosives were traced to the same person. given that we are now living in a world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent, when a bomb goes off, our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism. after all, in the last year alone, we have had several significant  incidents with a massive number of casualties and injuries in paris, san bernardino california, orlando florida and nice, to name a few. and of course, last week we remembered the 15th anniversary of the september 11, 2001 attacks where close to 3,000 people were killed at the hands of terrorists. however, we also live in a world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled a racist supersedes our natural instincts towards self-preservation which, of course, includes identifying the evil-doers. isn’t that how crimes are solved? law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the “bad guys.” unfortunately, our leadership – who ostensibly wants to protect us – finds their hands and their tongues tied. they are not allowed to be specific about their potential hypotheses for fear of offending anyone. new york city mayor bill de blasio – who famously ended “stop-and-frisk” profiling in his city – was extremely cautious when making his first remarks following the chelsea neighborhood explosion. “there is no specific and credible threat to new york city from any terror organization,” de blasio said late saturday at the news conference. “we believe at this point in this time this was an intentional act. i want to assure all new yorkers that the nypd and … agencies are at full alert”, he said. isn’t “an intentional act” terrorism? we may not know whether it is from an international terrorist group such as isis, or a homegrown terrorist organization or a deranged individual or group of individuals. it is still terrorism. it is not an accident. james o’neill, the new york city police commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by a natural gas leak at the time the mayor made his comments.  new york’s governor andrew cuomo was a little more direct than de blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility. however, he did say that it is a question of how the word “terrorism” is defined. “a bomb exploding in new york is obviously an act of terrorism.” cuomo hit the nail on the head, but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his “obvious” assessment? the two candidates for president hillary clinton and donald trump also weighed in on the chelsea explosion. clinton was very generic in her response saying that “we need to do everything we can to support our first responders – also to pray for the victims” and that “we need to let this investigation unfold.”  trump was more direct. “i must tell you that just before i got off the plane a bomb went off in new york and nobody knows what’s going on,” he said. “but boy we are living in a time—we better get very tough folks. we better get very, very tough. it’s a terrible thing that’s going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.” unfortunately, an incident like the chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as “soft targets.” now more than ever, america needs strong leadership which is laser-focused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres and is not afraid of being politically incorrect.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      another terrorist attack in nyc…why are we still being politically correct      
__label__1 most americans don’t realize that all revolutions aren’t the result of overt force. hitler, for instance, was voted into power in germany, as was hugo chávez in venezuela. currently in the united states we are in the process of such a revolution by the progressive controlled democrat party – sadly too many americans are oblivious to what is happening. it is impossible to know for sure whether this revolution is being orchestrated by a spectre-like secret cabal, or is the result of years of progressive fellow travelers advancing similar goals. in either case what has resulted is in essence a coup. america’s progressive revolution is being fought with ballots rather than bullets, and the progressives are winning. in order to do this the progressive movement had to overcome traditional american values or they would never be successful electing their way to power. seriously, if the democrat party had run with its present polices 60 years ago they would have not have come close to winning a single state. so how have they managed to get to where they are today? in the ‘60’s progressives, then called liberals started taking over the liberal arts departments of our colleges and universities. those humanity majors they converted to their ideology went into journalism, education, and the entertainment media. whether it was by plan or by inclination most of these liberal college grads joined the democrat party. since kennedy every single democrat nominee for president has championed the progressive ideology. you could argue that lyndon johnson and bill clinton who were more opportunists than true believers, but that didn’t stop them from supporting progressive goals. today you’d have a tough time finding even a moderate democrat candidate. heck, nearly half of the party was fine with nominating a self-described socialist. along with a news and entertainment media protecting democrats, and the education system promoting the progressive ideology you have former and current democrats in government sponsoring policies that garner still more votes and thereby gain more power. does anyone honestly believe that a picture id is that difficult to come by? democrats are all for anything legal, quasi-legal, and some would say even illegal to recruit more voters. immigrants and refugees are welcomed, given entitlements and are set to be democratic voters as soon as possible. we all remember the acorn voter fraud scandal, but if anyone seriously thinks that that was an isolated incident should really think again. the progressive revolution is ongoing. there are around 300 so-called sanctuary cities in the united states. these progressive cities refuse to obey the law of the land and have gotten away with it. likewise whole states refuse to follow federal laws when they don’t agree with them. worse, our current president, and cabinet officers, and whole departments in the federal government ignore their oaths to defend the constitution. and, thanks to the timid establishment republicans have done so with impunity. when the attorney general of the united states eric holder lied to congress without consequences – other than being found in contempt of congress – we have a coup going on. when the irs can use its power to punish political enemies of the administration going so far as to destroy evidence, that is a revolution. and certainly when former secretary of state hillary clinton broke the law but is protected by the state department, and the department of justice refuses to indict, we have a collapse of the rule of law. that is what happens in a coup. certainly president obama acts as if he doesn’t have to follow the constitution. for now many of his more overt executive orders have been blocked by the courts, but as the progressive revolution grows in strength the democrats appoint more and more judges who view the constitution as a living document. it is doubtful that the progressive revolution is led by obama or his handlers; they just take advantage of the increasing progressive power in the country. president obama has an arrogance about him that drives him to foreshadow events like the irs investigation, hillary clinton’s email investigation, and a possible rigging of the 2016 election. [read related article: did obama just foreshadow a rigged election come november?] when he was elected he did the same thing. in 2008 he said, “we are five days away from fundamentally transforming the united states of america.” that is what he’s done and progressive will continue to try to do. hillary, if elected will continue the progressive coup, possibly beyond our power to reverse. a trump victory, like ronald reagan’s, will slow it down, but it must take a sustained effort to confront our loss of freedom.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      the progressive takeover of america – we’re in the midst of a coup

__label__1 huma abedin dumped her then-husband anthony weiner when it was revealed that he had carried on a sexting relationship with another woman – one of many – in which he had sent a risqué picture of himself, and in the picture, he was accompanied by his young son. but unbeknownst to his then-wife and the rest of the world – but certainly not surprisingly – he was carrying on another relationship during this time with a 15-year-old girl in north carolina. from january to july, he sent photos and vulgar texts to her. i’ll let the new york post fill you in on the dirty details: the 15-year-old high school student went public with a trove of lurid come-ons she got from weiner, who exchanged his “carlos danger” persona for the alias “t dog” to send her kinky texts and shirtless selfies over a cell-phone messenger app. weiner repeatedly told the unidentified teen how “hard” and horny he was, at one point boasting that after sex with him she would, “limp for a week,” the daily mail reported. weiner — whose serial sexting cost him his seat in congress and a comeback bid for mayor — also shared pornographic videos with her, asked her to get naked and masturbate for him over skype, and even told her about “rape fantasies” that grossed her out. the girl said weiner tried to cover up the sexual nature of their relationship by pressuring her to write a letter to her father and a teacher in whom she had confided, “and tell them what i said was false.” even liberal democrat governor andrew cuomo is disgusted with weiner. “if the reports are true, it’s possibly criminal and it is sick,” he said. “and frankly, i’ve heard enough about anthony weiner, and i think that goes for all new yorkers.” if weiner is charged at the federal level with sexual exploitation of children, it carries with it a minimum of 15 years in prison, and a maximum of 30 years. at the state level, disseminating indecent material and promoting the sexual performance of a child could each get him 7 years in jail. in response, weiner said that he has “likely been the subject of a hoax,” but as the post pointed out, he didn’t deny any of the allegations against him. in a prepared statement, weiner said, “i have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement [sic] about the people i have communicated with online and the things i have sent. i am filled with regret and heartbroken for those i have hurt…. i have no one to blame but me for putting myself in this position. i am sorry.”  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      huma abedin’s ex caught sexting again…this time with a 15-year-old      
__label__1 saying ‘you guys’ is one of many “microaggressions” these days. using the incorrect pronoun to refer to someone else is also considered a microaggression, and in severe cases can carry with it criminal penalties. now, mispronouncing a student’s name – even if it’s particularly difficult – is considered a microaggression. i’m talking about people from other countries who speak other languages and come from different cultures who have names that are difficult for us english-speaking people to pronounce. we’ve all had encounters with people from central america, or india, or china, or somewhere in eastern europe, and have to have them repeat their name slowly so that we can – to the best of our abilities – pronounce it correctly. but unless you speak their native language fluently, you’re not going to get it. it doesn’t matter how close it sounds to you, inside, they’re laughing at the way you say their name. and i think most of these people understand that their names might be difficult for others – such as in america – to pronounce. but now, teachers mispronouncing their students’ names – even if they’re difficult – is a “microaggression.” and there’s a national movement to make sure teachers across the country aren’t guilty of this microaggression. cns news reported: according to ‘my name, my identity: a declaration of self,’ a national campaign launched in 2015 by the santa clara county, calif. office of education (sccoe) and the national association for bilingual education, a teacher who mispronounces a student’s name can cause that student “anxiety and resentment”. “mispronouncing a student’s name truly negates his or her identity, which, in turn, can hinder academic progress,” according to yee wan, sccoe’s director of multilingual education services. rita kohli, assistant professor of education at the university of california at riverside, says it is a sign of “microagression” when a teacher mispronounces, disregards, or changes a child’s name, because “they are in a sense disregarding the family and culture of the student as well.” the washoe county school district in reno, nevada is one of 528 school districts across the country that have recently implemented a campaign to “pronounce students’ names correctly” – including names teachers and administrators find difficult or unfamiliar – in order to be sensitive to the ancestral and historical significance of a child’s name. cns news linked to a 2014 blog post by a former teacher jennifer gonzalez who argued that “mutilating someone’s name is a tiny act of bigotry.” she continued:  “whether you intend to or not, what you’re communicating is this: your name is different. foreign. weird. it’s not worth my time to get it right…. “and before you get all defensive about the bigotry thing, let’s be clear: discovering that something you do might be construed as bigotry doesn’t mean anyone is calling you a bigot. it’s just an opportunity to grow.” what wasn’t brought up, of course, is how people from outside the u.s. pronounce americans’ names. my name is easy for me to pronounce, but non-americans often have a hard time pronouncing it. and guess how much it hurts my feelings when they “mispronounce” it? not a bit. but sometimes, i do feel like samir nagheenanajar from office space:   the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      mispronouncing foreign students’ names is a microaggression

__label__1 scroll down for video for those folks paying close attention to the national news, this last year has perhaps been an awakening for many, and no doubt a disappointment for some, as to how our judicial system really works, in that although we’d like to think that “justice is blind” or that there’s “equal justice under the law” in reality there are two distinct and different although parallel systems at work within america. one for us ordinary folks, and another for those political elites, which we seldom get to see, because for the most their malfeasance is usually covered-up and committed by politicians, who for the most part are lawyers, who become judges, who become prosecutors, and who eventually become president, in short a “sheepskin” for some is a legal license to steal, which of course is on full display this election season with hillary clinton and her gang. however as this las vegas public defender found out, wearing a “black lives matter” button into a courtroom isn’t exactly the smartest thing to do, in that she doesn’t belong to the political vip lounge, and of course what transpired next, was a visible clash of cultures taking place right there within the courtroom, as district judge douglas herndon ordered attorney erika ballou to remove the button.  “i took an oath to support the constitution, all of the constitution,” ballou said. “my oath is to protect everyone’s free speech, even if i disagree with it. i am not comfortable giving my case to someone else to handle. and i’m also not comfortable abridging my free speech.” she then acknowledged she would not remove the button and wanted another judge to hear the case, which of course herndon refused to recuse himself. “we’re not here on a petition about a movement or a protest or anything like that,” herndon said. “we’re here to dispense justice on a criminal calendar of cases. and that’s why i think it’s inappropriate.” one wonders what the reaction of attorney ballou would be if a defendant that she was tasked to represent, walked into court wearing a donald trump t-shirt, and would she be as adamant in protecting that person’s free speech? judge herndon said, “i’m asking the same things of them that i ask of anybody else. please leave any kind of political or opinion protest statements outside the courtroom.”  the police union’s new executive director, steve grammas, sent a letter which objected to “attorneys and other citizens who display ‘black lives matter’ propaganda in court.” “we have received complaints from our member officers who believe that such displays have no place in courtrooms in which justice is to be dispensed,” the letter read. “we are certain that the courts would not allow similar public displays from citizens who believe that killers should be sentenced to death or that sexual predators should be castrated.” here is the letter in it's entirety: ltr to chief judge david barker by las vegas review-journal on scribd        watch: judge destroys defense attorney who refuses to remove black lives matter pin…

__label__1 over the weekend, barack obama addressed the congressional black caucus for the last time as president. he hammered the republican nominee and admonished black voters to vote for the democratic nominee. he said he’d take it as a “personal insult” for members of the black community not to vote for her. here’s what he said: “if i hear anybody saying their vote does not matter, that it doesn’t matter who we elect — read up on your history. it matters. we’ve got to get people to vote,” obama said. “i will consider it a personal insult — an insult to my legacy — if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. you want to give me a good sendoff? go vote.” well, there’s at least one member of the black community who doesn’t care that it would be a personal insult to the president for him to vote not only against hillary, but for donald trump. he goes by a.d. bell, and according to his twitter profile, he’s an “army vet, realist party affil., father, college graduate, man, not a liberal or a conservative.” in his video, bell asks the president what he’s going to do to him, since he’s voting for trump. when people say they’re “insulted,” they act on it, he said. “so, what are you going to do to me, mr. obama?” an incensed bell asked. “i feel like liberals and democrats have insulted me for a long time. i feel like liberals and democrats have insulted black people for a long time.” “you know what i’m doing?! i’m voting against them!” he yelled, pointing to his camouflage ‘make america great again’ hat. listen to what he had to say:     the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      listen to this black army vet’s epic takedown of obama’s ‘personal insult’ comments [video]

__label__0 targeting voters hesitant to embrace republican donald trump in traditionally deep-red utah, hillary clinton’s campaign launched “mormons for hillary” on tuesday. the group’s launch, first reported by the salt lake tribune, is the latest move by clinton’s campaign in utah, a state that has not gone in favor of a democratic presidential candidate since 1964. the former secretary of state opened a campaign office in salt lake city last month and has published an op-ed in the deseret news, a newspaper owned by the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints. story continued below the group announced nearly 120 members, some of which have been lifelong republicans. "in 2016, the republican party's candidate for president — my party — is belittling and scapegoating people of other religious and ethnic minorities in the harshest language," retired brigadier general and former davis county, utah, republican party chair david irvine told the tribune. "his disdain for them is equaled only by his disdain and crudity toward women. the most enduring pioneer value is charity in its broadest sense, and utahns looking for those kinds of values should be reading [clinton's book] 'it takes a village' — and voting for hillary clinton." trump himself has admitted that he is “having a tremendous problem in utah.” while trump has tapped into veins of support with religious voters around the country, reliably-republican mormons have been slow to embrace the manhattan billionaire. former gop presidential candidate mitt romney, perhaps the most well-known mormon in political circles, has said he will not support trump and in march delivered a speech condemning him. in particular, trump’s proposal to ban muslims from entering the u.s. has made him a tough sell for mormon voters whose church has a history of facing persecution. trump has since backed away from that proposal in favor of one that restricts immigration from countries affected by terrorism, but his earlier proposal damaged him with utah voters. in june, sen. mike lee (r-utah) attacked trump as well, noting that trump’s “religiously intolerant” rhetoric makes him unattractive to utahans “in part because my state consists of people who are members of a religious minority church. a people who were ordered exterminated by the governor of missouri in 1838. and, statements like that make them nervous.”      clinton camp pushes 'mormons for hillary'      
__label__0 miami — hillary clinton leads donald trump by 5 points in the newest florida poll of likely voters, the latest in a series of topsy-turvy surveys that show the race shifting left, right and center by the day. monmouth university’s survey showing clinton up 46-41 percent over trump comes a day after a new york times/siena college poll that had the race essentially tied at 41-40 percent in clinton’s favor in a four-way contest that included the libertarian and green party candidates. story continued below the times/siena poll had a larger sample, 867 likely voters, compared to monmouth’s 400 sample that has an error-margin of 4.9 points. both polls also showed sen. marco rubio ahead of democratic u.s. rep. patrick murphy, with monmouth’s survey showing the republican’s lead at a narrow 2 points. and the surveys showed that clinton leads with non-white voters, while trump is ahead with whites. monmouth’s poll, however, does indicate the race has tightened. last month, she led by 9 points. the new poll also indicates that voters don’t believe trump when it comes to his longstanding crusade to question president obama’s status as a natural-born citizen qualified to be president. “although clinton’s lead is smaller than in our last poll, she is maintaining her advantage in florida given the ominous state of her poll standing last week,” patrick murray, the monmouth university polling institute’s director, said. “florida has become less of a crucial battleground now that the campaigns’ attention has turned to the rust belt,” he said. “however, a win here would make the path to 270 electoral votes that much easier for the victor and difficult for the loser.” monmouth’s poll shows that three quarters of voters said they heard that trump finally admitted that obama was born in the united states. however, only 24 percent think trump believes that obama is a natural-born citizen; 54 percent said trump made the admission for political expediency. though trump tried to implicate clinton in the birther controversy, 47 percent said that they didn’t believe she had a role in it; 35 percent believe she did — and nearly all were trump supporters. for the overwhelming majority of voters, 76 percent, the birther issue won’t affect their vote; but 18 percent said it would make them less likely to support trump and 4 percent said it would make them more likely to favor his candidacy. trump tried to say that he has now ended the issue by way of his admission, but democrats aren’t letting it go. they see the issue as paying two dividends for clinton in the race: undercutting perceptions of trump’s honesty and juicing turnout among african-americans upset that trump crusaded for years to de-legitimize the first black president. “if trump wanted to put an end to his role in the birther controversy with his statement on friday, it does not seem to have had the intended effect,” murray said. read the complete results of the monmouth university polling insitute florida poll here: http://bit.ly/2ckfol1 updated at 2:15 p.m. to include link to monmouth university polling insitute florida poll results.      florida fla. poll: clinton leads trump, who's not believed about birther controversy      
__label__0 hillary clinton’s suggestion that donald trump’s rhetoric is treasonous and a recruiting tool for the islamic state is beneath someone who’s running for the u.s. presidency, the republican presidential nominee said tuesday. “her claim that my opposition to radical islamic terrorism is a recruiting tool — what? how does that have to do with…” trump began. “i’m being tough. why is that a recruiting? i’m much tougher than her on this problem, this horrible situation, but she goes around saying it’s a recruiting tool.” story continued below clinton on monday hinted that the real estate mogul may be committing treason by “giving aid and comfort to our adversaries” — the constitutional definition of the term — and said that he “is being used as a recruiting sergeant in and for the terrorists.” during a rally in high point, north carolina, on tuesday afternoon, trump suggested that clinton was given her recruiting attack line by an advertising firm. “you know, somebody gave her that from madison avenue. you know what madison — that’s advertising,” trump said. “they gave her that from — they said let’s call it a recruiting tool. but why? because i’m tough? it’s a recruiting tool?” clinton’s rhetoric “demonstrates a level of ignorance about the terror threat,” trump added. “that really is disqualifying for a person seeking the presidency. when she says my opposition to radical islamic terror provides aid and comfort to the enemy, we know that hillary clinton has once again demonstrated that she’s really unfit for office. her comments are not only reckless but beneath the dignity of the office that she seeks.”      trump hits back at clinton for claiming he's a terrorist recruiting tool      
__label__0 republican vice presidential candidate mike pence called the outrage surrounding a social media post from his running mate’s son “remarkable,” especially when compared to hillary clinton’s proposals on immigration and national security. donald trump jr. posted an image to twitter on monday night with a bowl of skittles and the message “if i had a bowl of skittles and i told you that just three would kill you. would you take a handful? that’s our syrian refugee problem.” along with the image, trump jr. wrote “this image says it all. let's end the politically correct agenda that doesn't put america first. #trump2016.” story continued below the message from the son of the republican presidential nominee almost immediately drew criticisms of racism. the skittles metaphor is similar to one that white supremacists have used in the past, but pence dismissed the criticism in an interview tuesday with msnbc’s kelly o’donnell. “it is remarkable to me to see the level of outrage about a metaphor used by don jr. when hillary clinton is calling for a 550 percent increase in the syrian refugee program,” pence said. “all the while our fbi and public safety officials tell us we can't know for sure who those people are coming into this country.” trump campaign senior communications adviser jason miller echoed that comparison in a statement tuesday afternoon, calling trump jr. "a tremendous asset to the campaign." "america has become less safe under hillary clinton and barack obama, and clinton's planned 550 percent increase in syrian refugees is a dangerous proposal that will put american lives at risk," miller's statement read. "speaking the truth might upset those who would rather be politically correct than safe, but the american people want a change, and only donald trump will do what's needed to protect us."      pence calls outrage over trump jr.'s skittles tweet 'remarkable'      
__label__0 donald trump should apologize for pushing the “unseemly” birther conspiracy regarding where president barack obama was born, south carolina sen. lindsey graham indicated tuesday. trump last week explicitly acknowledged that obama was born in the u.s., though he went on to blame hillary clinton for igniting the so-called “birther” controversy despite no evidence and refused to apologize for questioning the validity of the country's first black president. story continued below “i would apologize,” graham, a frequent and colorful trump critic, told bloomberg politics on tuesday. “i think the whole movement was unseemly. i had a lot of distaste for it. no factual basis. i think he would be taking the high ground, but that’s up to him.” graham referred to the birther conspiracy as a “fringe issue” that he didn’t take seriously and said trump didn’t do “the country a service by pushing this.” graham, a former gop presidential candidate, has encouraged other republicans to un-endorse trump and hinted that the next president will likely be a “she,” though he has said he won’t vote for either candidate.      lindsey graham: trump should apologize for pushing birtherism

__label__0 when is the first general election presidential debate? the first general election presidential debate of 2016 will be held at hofstra university in hempstead, new york on sept. 26. story continued below what time is the debate and how long is it? the debate will start at 9:00 p.m. eastern time and run for 90 minutes without commercial breaks. how can i watch the debate? it will be broadcast on all of the major television networks, as well as the websites for major cable news channels and c-span. who will participate in the debate? former secretary of state hillary clinton and celebrity real estate mogul donald trump. no other candidates qualified. who will moderate the debate? lester holt, who anchors "nbc nightly news," will be the moderator. it’s his second time serving in that role in the 2016 presidential cycle. holt was also a moderator for the democratic primary debate on january 17. on february 15, 2015 holt became the substitute anchor of nbc nightly news after brian williams was suspended. four months later he became the permanent anchor. what is the format of the debate? the debate will be divided into six segments of 15 minutes each. each segment will start with a question from holt, after which each candidates will have two minutes for an initial response and then will be allowed to respond to each other. on monday, the commission on presidential debates announced the tentative topics for the debate: “america's direction,” “achieving prosperity,” and “securing america.” the topics are subject to change based on news developments, according to the commission. why aren't jill stein or gary johnson participating in the debate? libertarian party presidential nominee gary johnson and green party presidential nominee jill stein were not invited by the presidential debate commission. the commission said it would only invite candidates that averaged 15 percent in five national polls it selected. neither johnson nor stein made that threshold. what's at stake for hillary clinton? the debate is clinton’s chance to turn the page on a few weeks during which trump has eaten much of the polling lead she built following her convention. clinton’s camp has also been counting on her policy knowledge and debate experience to help her expose trump’s weaknesses, but the democratic candidate also comes in facing higher expectations than trump. what's at stake for donald trump? trump has been accused lacking policy gravitas and self-restraint, and both of those perceived weaknesses could be exposed in a debate, where candidates will be grilled on their familiarity with issues foreign and domestic and be expected to keep composed under rhetorical assault from their opponents. trump has the advantage, however, of low expectations: at several turns in the presidential campaign, even modest pivots away from his bombastic primary style were hailed as pivots to professionalism, and a similar self-restraint — provided he still hits the high notes his supporters are expected — could help him clear the low bar again. what is the most watched debate in presidential history? in 1980 the debate between president jimmy carter and republican presidential nominee ronald reagan garnered a viewership of 80.6 million people, the largest television audience for a debate since nielsen ratings began collecting viewership data in 1976. in 2012, the first general election presidential debate between president barack obama and republican presidential nominee mitt romney attracted about 70 million viewers. what's the most-watched television moment of all time? super bowl xlix in 2015 on nbc is currently the most watched television program in u.s. history, attracting 114 million viewers, according to nbc news. the new england patriots played against the seattle seahawks, winning the game 28-24. still, that pales in comparison to the estimated 600 million people worldwide who watched neil armstrong and buzz aldrin make the first moon landing on july 20, 1969, or the estimated 750 million people worldwide that watched prince charles of wales marry lady diana spencer on july 29, 1981.      everything you need to know about trump and clinton’s first 2016 presidential debate      
__label__0 donald trump’s campaign, hoping to counter hillary clinton’s air assault, is in talks with veteran gop ad maker rex elsass, according to three sources familiar with the discussions. elsass, according to one of the sources, met with trump officials in new york city last week. story continued below elsass has deep connections to the trump campaign. he previously served as a top strategist to vice presidential nominee mike pence, and in 2012 he worked with trump campaign manager kellyanne conway for missouri senate candidate todd akin, who came under widespread criticism after making controversial remarks about rape. elsass is a partner at strategy group for media, a firm that has also counted jim murphy, trump’s national political director, as an employee. trump’s advertising campaign has been led by jamestown, a prominent political consulting firm with an anti-establishment edge. two jamestown employees, jason miller and larry weitzner, have taken senior roles in the campaign. also helping to lead the trump ad effort is rick reed, a veteran gop strategist who assisted the swift boat veterans for truth campaign against john kerry in 2004. discussions about bringing aboard elsass come as trump is getting walloped on the airwaves. on sept. 12, smart media group, a media buying firm that works with the republican national committee, detailed in an email to trump campaign officials how clinton was outspending the republican nominee on tv by an astonishing seven-to-one margin. with polling in many battlegrounds suggesting the race is tight, many republican strategists are concerned that trump’s lack of commercial spending could pose problems as the contest enters its final seven weeks. the ohio-based gop operative has a long history in republican politics, having worked for a number of presidential candidates over the years. during this year’s primary season, elsass advised rand paul and, following paul’s departure from the race, john kasich. in 2012, he worked for michele bachmann and newt gingrich. neither elsass nor a trump spokesperson responded to requests for comment.      trump team talking to veteran gop ad man elsass

__label__0 mitch mcconnell summoned his republican conference to a late afternoon meeting on tuesday with an unusual ask: would his colleagues support moving forward on a spending deal that doesn’t even exist yet? the answer, surprisingly, was yes. story continued below the senate voted 89-7 on tuesday evening to move forward on a bill that eventually will be used to fund the government through dec. 9 and deliver $1.1 billion to fight the zika epidemic. a bloc of conservatives voted no, but the measure easily cleared the 60-vote threshold to avoid a filibuster, powered by votes from senate democrats, centrist republicans and gop senators up for reelection. “we’ve got a lot of work to do around here,” said sen. david perdue (r-ga.), who voted “no” because of concerns over the unorthodox process. yet enough republicans supported mcconnell on the matter because there are still several opportunities to block the bill later if senators believe they are getting a raw deal in the end, senators said. the majority leader offered a brief update on the state of play to his conference, but the main reason for the meeting was to make sure there was enough support to begin a process that eventually will allow senate republicans to go home and campaign for reelection more quickly. “there are negotiations that are ongoing, and this bill in my view just sets the stage for an agreement that we hope occurs sooner rather than later,” said sen. jerry moran (r-kan.). campaign finance, trucking safety and the internet domain system are among the grab bag of issues keeping the senate from a final deal to stave off a government shutdown at the end of this month. but the biggest hurdle, zika, has been resolved without including any language that would block planned parenthood’s partner clinic in puerto rico from accessing the federal grants — a key demand from democrats. “we want a clean cr, a clean zika bill, period,” said sen. dick durbin of illinois, the second-ranking senate democrat. “we’ll save the debate on the riders for the lame-duck session.” mcconnell told reporters the parties were “close” to finalizing an agreement tuesday afternoon, but he said he he would want senators to have some time to consider it before moving forward. and senior republicans said the senate was certain to stay in session next week, ensuring that the annual slog over must-pass government spending would — as in previous years — go down to the wire. democrats pin the blame for the delay on the gop. “we should have no vexatious, poison-pill riders,” senate minority leader harry reid said. “we are not going to have a cr loaded with riders. one is too many, and that’s what they’re trying to do.” the nevada democrat took particular umbrage at the prospect of continuing a prohibition on the securities and exchange commission from requiring public companies to disclose political spending. that provision was included in last year’s omnibus spending bill, but reid said he will fight to strip it out. “we’re not going to have this bill [be] a pincushion for mcconnell’s desire to have nothing, nothing reported dealing with campaign spending,” reid said. lawmakers also are clashing over the obama administration’s plan to relinquish the u.s. government’s authority over the internet domain system to an international body on oct. 1. republicans led by texas sen. ted cruz and senate commerce chairman john thune of south dakota are pushing to continue a prohibition on the handover, which is sharply opposed by the administration. “it’s just trying to figure out how to structure it, how to do it, how to make it effective,” thune said of the internet domain issue, known as icann. “i think in some form, i think that issue has to be addressed.” republicans said both the sec language and the internet battle were still under consideration as of late tuesday. cruz voted “no” on moving forward. a gop-backed push to block transportation department rules regarding how long truckers must rest between drives is among other final issues to be determined. as of late tuesday afternoon, however, it appeared as though the trucking issue was close to being resolved, according to one source familiar with the negotiations. congressional negotiators also were continuing to discuss offsets for zika funding. and it looked increasingly likely that the continuing resolution will not include money to address the lead contamination crisis in flint, michigan, or to respond to the devastating flooding in louisiana. “the democrats are insisting upon flint, and we’ve got members who are interested in some assistance for flooding in louisiana,” thune said. “maybe it ends up that neither gets addressed — i don’t know.” thune also suggested that an administration effort to restore the export-import bank’s full financing authority was falling short. “i know that the dems are very intent on changing that quorum threshold, but even if we could pass it through the senate — and i don’t know we can — that makes a very heavy lift in the house.” jennifer scholtes and adam behsudi contributed to this report.      senate advances budget deal that doesn't exist yet      
__label__0 new york — president barack obama called on nations to "welcome the stranger" on tuesday during a much-touted gathering on refugees aimed at rallying support for the record 65 million people displaced around the world. he also managed to take a veiled shot at donald trump. story continued below the u.s.-sponsored summit, which drew a number of private sector participants, was one of two major refugee-related gatherings this week on the margins of the annual u.n. general assembly meeting. the events took place as new york-area authorities pursued and caught an afghan-born bombing suspect, the hunt for whom fueled the debate in the u.s. presidential race over refugees. trump has slammed democratic rival hillary clinton for her openness to taking in refugees and other immigrants. (one of trump's sons, in a tweet that provoked backlash on monday, compared refugees to poisonous skittles.) clinton has defended her stance, while calling for proper vetting of all who enter the u.s. in a subtle rebuke of the republican nominee's promise to build a wall along the u.s.-mexico border, obama framed the world's response to the refugee crisis as "a test of our common humanity — whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls or whether we see ourselves in one another." the president also spoke of the cause of one of the biggest refugee crises today: the war in syria. but he gave no indication he was willing to consider a greater u.s. military role to help end that conflict. "wars like the savagery in syria must be brought to an end," he said, adding that it must be "through political settlements and diplomacy, not simply by bombing." the white house unveiled a series of commitments from the international community in response to the call for action from obama and other allies in the united nations. they include some $650 million, including in-kind contributions, from more than 50 private-sector entities. the largest share was a $500 million investment pledge from billionaire george soros, who wrote in the wall street journal that he will pump money into "startups, established companies, social-impact initiatives and businesses founded by migrants and refugees themselves." ahead of this week's summits, the obama administration announced the united states will take in 110,000 refugees from around the world, including a "significant" number of syrians, in the fiscal year that starts oct. 1. that figure disappointed refugee advocates who'd hoped the administration would take it closer to 200,000 refugees. the president is, after all, urging other countries to double their intake, and a growing number of countries have stepped up to take refugees for the first time or expand their resettlement programs. in the fiscal year wrapping up this month, the u.s. will have accepted 85,000 refugees. still, advocacy groups have expressed overall strong support for the u.s.-sponsored summit, saying it will achieve concrete results. activists were less impressed with a u.n.-sponsored refugee summit held monday, which kicked down the road until 2018 many difficult decisions about how the global community should handle migration crises.      obama urges nations to open arms to refugees      
__label__0 donald trump’s white house bid is “a movement, not a campaign,” a new ad released by the manhattan billionaire proclaims. the 30-second tv spot, announced tuesday via email by the trump campaign, is entitled “movement” and features a string of phrases describing the gop nominee as a “builder, businessman, success” and praising him for “doing what others called impossible.” story continued below cutting quickly between video of construction sites, trump himself and seemingly ordinary american families and children, the video touts the real estate mogul’s campaign as “dreaming big” and “building bigger.” among other claims, the ad says trump’s candidacy is “defined by freedom” and “leaving the past behind.” the latter statement from the ad’s unseen narrator is accompanied by video from a 1992 “60 minutes” interview with bill and hillary clinton in which the former president denied having an affair with gennifer flowers, a woman bill clinton would later admit to having had a sexual relationship with. “while hillary clinton ‘distracts and diverts’ attention away from her horrific record with negative advertisements that lack substance, our campaign plans on promoting the positive energy that has turned mr. trump’s campaign into a full-fledged movement,” trump campaign senior communications adviser jason miller said in a statement that accompanied the ad’s release.      trump ad uses footage of clintons' 1992 interview about gennifer flowers      
__label__0 after fox news host sean hannity appeared in a pro-donald trump political video over the weekend, the network will prohibit him from appearing in promotional political materials through the end of the election, a spokesperson said tuesday. “we were not aware of sean hannity participating in a promotional video and he will not be doing anything along these lines for the remainder of the election season,” the spokesperson said in a statement to politico. on sunday, trump’s presidential campaign uploaded an eight-minute video that showed a number of conservative figures expressing their support of the republican candidate. one of those figures included the fox news show host, who spoke for about 30 seconds expressing his support of the candidate. the washington post’s erik wemple was the first to report on the video. hannity has been a long-time supporter of trump, and said in june that he would be voting for the republican nominee. but his appearance in the campaign video released sunday was the first of its kind this election season. it’s unclear how the network will address hannity’s appearance in the video during a town hall with trump on the network wednesday, which hannity is scheduled to host. a spokesperson said at press time that there were no updates when asked about hannity’s involvement in the town hall.      fox news: sean hannity won’t appear in any more trump ads      
__label__0 the sunlight foundation, a nonprofit and nonpartisan advocacy group that supports open government and tracks money in politics, announced tuesday that it was cutting staff and suspending its data-driven projects and reporting tools. the organization, which launched in 2006 with the express purpose of tracking money in politics, said that it would end its tool building and database maintenance, which are often used by reporters writing about campaign finance and politics. michael klein, the sunlight foundation’s board chairman, wrote in a post tuesday explaining the decision to scale back dramatically. “while we are enormously proud of what sunlight has accomplished over the past decade, and has come to stand for, we are also aware of the changes time has wrought,” klein wrote in the post. “we are aware that the robust maturation of technology over the past decade has — happily but substantially — reduced the urgency of sunlight’s early role as a leading transparency innovator. in addition, the board had to recognize that sunlight’s initiating objective— to build support for better legislation against and regulation of the power of money in politics— has been significantly limited by the us supreme court’s 5-4 citizens united decision.” it’s unclear the number of people who were laid off from sunlight foundation tuesday, or who could be laid off in the future. the organization as of tuesday morning employed around 25 people. several staffers were informed today that their positions had been eliminated, but management is still in the process of informing others. at least one staff writer, libby watson, announced on twitter that she had been laid off. a spokesperson for sunlight foundation said that financial challenges played a role in the cuts and suspension of its tools. sunlight foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, is funded through donations. “it became increasingly harder to fund and maintain all of these different things,” the spokesperson said, referring to the various tools sunlight foundation has built over the years, tracking everything from deleted tweets of politicians to political fundraising. another factor was the organization’s inability to find a permanent executive director with a vision for the organization’s future, klein wrote. sunlight foundation co-founder, ellen miller, stepped down from her role as executive director in 2014, and the organization struggled to retain upper management since then. “the board has not found a candidate for executive director who persuaded us of both a compelling new strategic vision and of their capacity to lead sunlight to its achievement,” klein wrote. “accordingly, we have determined to explore alliances with other organizations similarly motivated, perhaps merging with one of them, in an arrangement that advances and preserves sunlight’s mission and identity with increased efficiency and effectiveness.” the hope is that sunlight foundation’s work can live on and be built upon at likeminded organizations devoted to government transparency and campaign finance. those possible partnerships – or a potential merger with another organization, which klein said the organization was exploring — will play a role in the fate of the employees at the nonprofit. those potential partnerships are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. for the time being, sunlight foundation hopes to continue scaled-back operations for as long as possible.      open government advocacy group sunlight foundation cuts staff, suspends reporting tools      
__label__0 donald trump on tuesday evening declared that the nation's african-american communities "are absolutely in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever." as he has done regularly of late, trump attacked the democratic politicians who overwhelmingly control america’s urban centers as having failed the african-american populations who live there. before a mostly-white audience at a rally in rural north carolina, trump rhetorically asked black voters, “what do you have to lose?” story continued below "we’re going to make our country wealthy again. we’re going to make our country safe again. we’re going to rebuild our inner cities because our african-american communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever,” trump said. “you take a look at the inner cities, you get no education, you get no jobs, you get shot walking down the street. they’re worse, i mean honestly, places like afghanistan are safer than some of our inner cities.” while trump told the crowd that his message has been resonating with african-american voters, his poll numbers suggest otherwise. the manhattan billionaire has struggled mightily with minority voters throughout his white house bid, polling often in the single digits among black voters and in some cases registering zero percent support.      trump calls african-american communities in the worst shape 'ever, ever, ever'      
__label__0 outgoing rep. tim huelskamp is angry that he lost his primary — and he wants everyone in the house of representatives to know it. the ultra-conservative kansas republican took to the floor late tuesday afternoon to force roll call votes on a series of what leadership thought were noncontroversial bills being offered up by voice vote. he objected to 17 of the bills, blocking them from being passed by a simple voice vote tuesday evening. story continued below since his objections meant the house would be required to hold roll calls on all of them, a tedious process which could take two or three hours, leaders were forced to postpone all but three of the measures into wednesday. huelskamp's latest move comes just a few days after he threatened to force a vote on the impeachment of the irs commissioner, despite the fact that chairman jim jordan (r-ohio) struck a deal with judiciary chairman bob goodlatte (r-va.) to postpone the vote until after the election. republicans, including some of his own friends, have noted that he’s become something of a loose canon since returning to washington after being defeated in his primary in august. “so much for all of mr. huelskamp’s rhetoric about the need for lame duck members to go quietly into the night,” said one gop official. to be fair, however, a number of house freedom caucus members and the heritage foundation also had objections to several proposals. his office also noted that "a quick review appears to indicate that this is the largest number of suspensions in one day for the entire 2015-2016 congressional calendar." "americans deserve better than for congressional leaders to decide late on a friday to suddenly place 49 bills on the calendar," his office wrote politico in an email. "with no clear, public criteria for selection of these bills from among thousands of others, americans at least deserve the transparency of knowing how their member of congress votes on these bills." establishment-aligned outside groups including the u.s. chamber of commerce and joe rickett’s “ending spending” group poured more than a million into huelskamp’s race to defeat him. they said he was ineffective because he voted against everything, and argued his poor relationships in washington got him kicked off the agriculture committee, a prized spot for his district. huelskamp blames house gop leadership for not coming to his rescue. in recent days he’s openly criticized speaker paul ryan (r-wis.). some members groused privately that huelskamp looked all too happy to scuttle the floor schedule tuesday evening. he sat in the back row of the house chamber, avoiding the c-span cameras but asking for roll calls on bills. usually lawmakers go down to the desk — in full view of the cameras — to request the yeas and nays. meanwhile, around the capitol, one of the biggest questions driving tuesday chatter was whether he would force the irs impeachment issue later this week.      rep. tim huelskamp goes rogue      
__label__0 new york — john kerry has been called an "indefatigable optimist," the kind of guy determined to try, try again in spite of tough odds. it's a drive that helped him push through the iran nuclear deal and keeps him searching for ways to solve the israeli-palestinian crisis. but the latest chaos in syria has critics saying he may be trying too hard this time — looking weak in the process and undermining his own goal of a peace deal. story continued below a syrian cease-fire that kerry announced less than two weeks ago is near collapse. the first big blow came saturday after an apparently errant u.s. airstrike believed to have killed dozens of syrian government soldiers instead of islamic state terrorists not party to the truce. then, on monday, suspected syrian government airstrikes hit an aid convoy, killing at least 12 people and infuriating moderate rebels already wary of making a deal with syrian president bashar assad. and late on tuesday, a report emerged that u.s. intelligence indicates that russian forces actually carried out the strike. by any measure, the developments are a blow to the 72-year-old secretary of state. still, on tuesday on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly in new york, kerry met yet again with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov, syria's de facto international representative, to see what could be done to salvage the cease-fire. "he seems unaware that it's simply impossible to win at the negotiating table what you do not win on the ground, and he seems to be unaware that he keeps getting outsmarted and outmaneuvered by lavrov," elliott abrams, a former deputy national security adviser in republican george w. bush's administration, wrote in an e-mail to politico. "his defenders say well, better to try than to give up, but that is wrong. he looks weak, and that makes the united states look weak." the argument to keep trying is compelling. an estimated half-million people have died in the syrian civil war since march 2011, and millions more have been displaced from their homes. syria's misery is likely to be the biggest stain on kerry's legacy as secretary of state, not to mention barack obama's legacy as president. kerry's defenders grouse that he is being unfairly criticized by detractors who fail to offer reasonable alternatives — scenarios that won't slip the u.s. into another war in the middle east. and the secretary of state himself, wherever he goes, insists that the problem in syria must ultimately be solved through a political, not military solution. "what he's trying to do on syria isn't about his legacy — he doesn't view it in those terms," a state department official told politico. "critics can claim all they want that he is being unrealistic, but they aren’t sitting in the room like the rest of us watching him work tirelessly to try to find a way through, leveraging every ounce of personal relationships he has to reach [an] accord. never once have i heard him talk blindly about trust. it’s always been a sober assessment of the interests at stake and an honest effort to negotiate. the man knows people, and he knows how far he can take things." added a former administration official of kerry: "i just don't think he gives two thoughts to whether some wise guy in washington believes he shouldn't have tried. he would want to hear their alternative." but the russians, and for that matter the syrians, have little incentive to acquiesce to an administration that's on its way out; and moscow appears either unwilling or unable to rein in assad. the syrian dictator, bent on staying in power, appears impervious to criticism from enemies and pleas from allies. robert ford, a former obama administration ambassador to syria, said kerry's tactics, not his intent, pose a risk. "i’m full of admiration for him for being willing to try. he’s not afraid to grapple with big issues, and i think he deserves some credit for that," said ford, now at the middle east institute. "what’s not clear is whether his constantly going back to the russians over and over again is helping or hurting his efforts to convince them. it's making him look weak. i don’t know that the russians do things out of kindness or if instead they take advantage of weak players and weak countries." part of the problem for kerry, observers say, is that obama appears to have zero interest in committing more military muscle to give his secretary of state leverage in the talks with russia. "time will prove that kerry played a weak hand as good as he could," said randa slim, an analyst also with the middle east institute. "the blame for u.s. inaction in syria and its consequences should rest on obama's shoulders, not kerry's." it also doesn't help that there are divisions within the obama administration over what to do about syria. more than 50 u.s. officials signed a memo leaked earlier this year that urges u.s. airstrikes on the assad regime. kerry himself is reported to have asked obama to allow airstrikes on specific syrian government targets to put assad on notice, but obama, wary of deepening the u.s. military role in the conflict, has declined. the recent bargain kerry struck with russia on syria also has upset the pentagon because it included coordination between moscow and washington on airstrikes against terrorist groups such as the islamic state. defense officials are extremely wary of sharing intelligence with russia. kerry's defenders insist he is not naive, despite his professed faith in the power of negotiations. for instance, at least twice during the marathon talks that led to the nuclear deal with iran last year, kerry reportedly became fed up with iranian intransigence and threatened to quit the negotiations. in fact, kerry's determination to get a deal with tehran fueled similar questions last year about whether he was too eager for a legacy-making accomplishment. kerry has spent most of his life in public service, but he's been dogged by criticism that he passed too few notable bills during his years as a lawmaker. he also failed to defeat bush in the 2004 race for the white house. another challenge kerry has tried to solve repeatedly is the conflict between the israelis and the palestinians. after taking over as secretary of state in 2013, kerry pushed the two sides to try once again to come to terms. but ultimately that effort sputtered. the syria crisis is in many ways more complex than the decades old israeli-palestinian conflict. not only is the carnage ongoing and on an extraordinary scale, the sheer number of syrian groups involved and international actors taking sides makes three-dimensional chess look easy. the cease-fire currently on the brink in syria isn't even the first one kerry has helped devise. a truce reached in february kept hold for several weeks before eventually collapsing. then, too, kerry worked long hours to negotiate with the russians to agree to the cease-fire. that was alongside on and off initiatives to bring syrian rebel leaders and assad's representatives to the bargaining table for a long-term deal. on monday, following the airstrike on the u.n. aid convoy, senior administration officials briefing reporters had tough words for russia, saying it was responsible for the syrian government's actions. "the russians have the responsibility certainly to restrain — refrain from taking such action themselves, but they also have the responsibility to keep the regime from doing it," one official said. "the burden is on the russians to demonstrate ... quickly and in a significant way, that they are committed to this process, which — without which obviously we’re not going to be able to move forward with them." the administration's tone was more restrained following tuesday's meeting between lavrov, kerry, and others involved in the syrian peace effort. a readout from the state department said participants decided they needed to meet again, but agreed that despite the violence, "there was still an imperative to pursue a nationwide cessation of hostilities." the shorter version? john kerry is going to keep trying.      kerry's optimism is put to the test      
__label__0 child migrants suffered a major setback in the federal courts on tuesday, but congress and the white house also found themselves lectured to from the bench for failing to do more to help the juveniles, thousands of whom have been thrown into deportation hearings without defense counsel. at one level, the ruling by a three-judge panel of the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals is a clear victory for the justice department. it effectively dooms a long-awaited federal district court trial, scheduled to begin in november in seattle, on the children’s right to counsel. story continued below but at a second level, justice’s win had a hollow ring as two of the three judges wrote a concurring opinion that repeatedly invoked the words of former attorney general eric holder that the government has a “moral obligation” to ensure the presence of counsel for the children. “what is missing here. money and resolve — political solutions that fall outside the purview of the courts,” wrote judge margaret mckeown, a democratic appointee, together with her republican appointee colleague, judge milan smith. “the stakes are too high,” they concluded. “to give meaning to ‘equal justice

struggle through that system, the problem demands action now.” the underlying case arises from a federal lawsuit filed against the government in july 2014 by the american civil liberties union and the northwest immigrant rights project. the backdrop was the record number of border crossings that spring and summer by unaccompanied children from central america. in the ensuing turmoil, the obama administration responded by ordering the immigration courts to quickly arraign the new arrivals, with or without legal counsel. the accelerated proceedings — dubbed rocket dockets — overwhelmed the fragile network of private attorneys typically available to the children. judges seized the chance to issue removal orders on the spot, and in the first 13 months, nearly 2,800 juveniles — hundreds of whom were 14 or younger — received deportation orders after being afforded only a single hearing and no defense counsel. the crisis has since moved out of the headlines, but the total number of removal orders issued for the child migrants since july 2014 had already passed 12,300 by the end of may. these decisions have become a very real threat to the young migrants, especially those who arrived as teenagers and are now 18 or older. filed in seattle, the lawsuit landed before u.s. district court judge thomas zilly, who cautiously tried to define some middle ground that would at least extend added protections for the youngest defendants. when justice challenged his jurisdictional authority to hear the case, zilly issued a telltale decision in april 2015 that effectively split the baby. on the narrow statutory grounds, zilly agreed with the administration. but on the larger constitutional question of the children’s due process rights, zilly refused to dismiss the lawsuit outright and said the plaintiffs deserved a timely answer. it was this april 2015 decision by zilly that brought the case to the 9th circuit, where the administration argued that the district court had overstepped its jurisdiction and any due process claims of the children were subject to the limits imposed by congress. “whatever congress provides them, is their due process,” a justice attorney told the court bluntly in one exchange when the case was argued in july. that did not sit well with the panel, but at the same time, the judges faulted the plaintiffs trying to go around the narrow legal path set out by congress for any such appeals. it is this legal path — governing deportation appeals — that is at the nub of the jurisdictional fight. as set out in statute, all such deportation appeals must first go to the board of immigration appeals, which is part of the same immigration court system that has dealt so harshly with the children. only after exhausting this remedy can a defendant next file a petition for review and get a hearing with the respective federal appeals court for his or her circuit. advocates for the children argue that this poses a catch-22 in that no child without an attorney can be expected to navigate such a complicated appeals process. the system becomes punitive, they say, and effectively denies due process, requiring the courts to intervene. in truth, zilly, appointed to the federal bench by former president ronald reagan, has struggled openly with the very same legal dilemma from the outset of the lawsuit two years ago. he ultimately felt that the constitutional due process question had sufficient weight to demand a timely court hearing and allow him to move ahead for at least the youngest children. time and again, he showed a special concern for those under 14 years old. so much so that in a recent filing, the plaintiffs argued for a summary judgment at least for this “subclass” of child migrants. the appeals panel clearly shared some of that concern but wanted a tidier path to get to an answer and around the federal statutes. having failed to find one, tuesday’s ruling wipes out what has been years of work by child advocates trying to get a court hearing on the right-to-counsel issue. “the 9th circuit today held that the courthouse doors are effectively closed to thousands of children whose only opportunity to seek appointed counsel in their immigration proceedings is through this case,” said ahilan arulanantham, who has been the aclu’s lead counsel on the case. “the court issued that ruling even as it simultaneously recognized that virtually all children cannot represent themselves in immigration proceedings.” “we disagree with this decision, and will continue the fight to ensure that the claims of these children to appointed counsel receive their day in court. in light of the 9th circuit’s recognition of the moral imperative at stake, we again call on the obama administration to exercise its power to cease its unjust practice of requiring children to represent themselves in immigration court.” matt adams, who has taken the lead in the case for the northwest immigrant rights project, was scathing in his frustration with the court’s ruling. “the court determined that a theoretical possibility for judicial review suffices even where as a practical matter, the thousands of unrepresented children will be ordered deported without ever having an opportunity to argue that they are need an attorney to get a fair hearing,” adams said. “the court points to one case of an unrepresented child back in 2004 that reached its doors. ... but if there is only one case in 15 years, with thousands of other children who have been deported, this only demonstrates there is no meaningful opportunity.” justice had no immediate public comment, but privately officials signaled little joy with the win. indeed, the harsh treatment of the children in 2014 and 2015 remains a genuine embarrassment for the white house. draft rules are under consideration to create a more uniform system nationally, under which immigration judges would give children more time to find lawyers. and before the president leaves office next year, there is pressure to have these completed and in place.      child migrants lose major case in federal court      
__label__0 eighteen months ago, three junior senators attempted something their chamber had never considered, much less accomplished—starting to roll back the long-entrenched federal ban on marijuana. though all first-termers, the senators—kirsten gillibrand of new york, cory booker of new jersey and rand paul of kentucky—knew enough about the difficulties of marijuana politics to avoid any mention of full-scale legalization. they tailored the bill to focus narrowly on medical marijuana and the half-dozen stumbling blocks in federal law that have made it so difficult for americans to get safe access to the increasingly popular drug. story continued below they branded their bill with a clever acronym: the carers act, for the compassionate access, research expansion and respect states act of 2015, which, if passed, would do a number of sensible things: reclassify marijuana so that it is considered to have some medical value; permit banks to handle money from legal marijuana businesses; prevent the government from interfering with state-legal medical marijuana programs; exclude non-psychoactive marijuana extracts from the definition of marijuana; grant military veterans access to medical marijuana; and break the government’s monopoly on medical marijuana research. to no one’s surprise, the bill went absolutely nowhere. but it didn’t die. despite being ignored by leadership, it managed to collect 16 cosponsors by the end of 2015, a laundry list of mostly democrats, two republicans and an independent. then, early this year, a 17th name was added, and a surprising one at that: lindsey graham. the senior senator from south carolina, an establishment republican if ever there was one, a foreign policy hawk who ran for president this cycle in large part because he perceived rand paul’s isolationism as a threat to national security, lindsey graham—who represents a state that doesn’t even allow medical marijuana—has become one of the unlikeliest and potentially most influential of the bill’s backers because he is unique among the bill's cosponsors (now at 20), as he’s the only one with a gavel. and unlike his colleagues among republican leadership, graham is using his authority to move the marijuana bill forward. in mid-july, he chaired a judiciary subcommittee hearing focused on the pros and cons of changing the way the drug enforcement administration classifies marijuana like it was heroin. over the 4&frac12; decades of the war on drugs, there have been plenty of hearings on the dangers of marijuana, but before july 13 there had never been a hearing on marijuana's medical benefits. “if there was one, i don't know about it,” graham told politico magazine. the emergence of graham as an honest broker of information on this issue reflects rapidly shifting attitudes among conservative americans. opposition to marijuana legalization among republicans has withered from 60 percent in december 2014 to 42 percent in july 2016, while the percentage of republicans in favor of legalizing pot has grown from 28 percent to 45 percent over the same period. but graham does more than just add a prominent voice. his decision to chair a hearing was a critical step (though no guarantee) toward getting a vote on the carers act in the full judiciary committee, the only avenue by which it can reach the senate floor. graham, he is at pains to point out, rejects marijuana for recreational use, but he told politico magazine, “i am open-minded to the idea that the plant may have medical attributes that could help people.…i'm convinced that we should, as a nation, research the medical applications of the marijuana plant....it could be life-changing. i just want to do it in a scientific way…and the current system doesn't allow for the research that we need.” *** we’ve seen this before, when public opinion swings suddenly on a divisive cultural issue and yanks lawmakers along by the arm. it happened with gay marriage, and the impetus of the change is always personal experience. graham’s conversion has been no different. “i have several people that i personally know who have children who have some epilepsy and other diseases,” graham told politico, “and the parents seem to think this helps. and…what stuns me is how little we know and how much more we could know. some of these [diseases], like epilepsy, the families tell us that it has changed the child's life. that’s why i want more research. is that anecdotal, or is it real? to me, that's very exciting.” parents of children with epilepsy have become the most effective advocates for marijuana law reform at every level. consequently, in a very short time frame, laws legalizing cannabidiol (cbd), a non-psychoactive compound found in the cannabis plant, have passed in 16 states, mostly in the south and southeast: texas, alabama, mississippi and, yes, south carolina. the problem is that most of these laws provide little access to actual cbd because marijuana is still classified as a highly addictive drug with no medical benefit. so the state laws, in some cases, have made matters worse by providing false hope for the parents of sick children, a problem the carers act aims to solve. “when you ask if it is still illegal under federal law, it’s almost a trick question,” said jill swing, a south carolina resident and mother of a child affected by a disease that is treatable with cbd. “currently the federal government is in conflict with itself. the federal farming act of 2014 allows for cultivation of hemp….that being said, all forms of cannabis, including hemp, are considered schedule i controlled substances by the dea. that is why the cbd component of the carers act is so important.” it’s parents like swing who helped educate graham on the importance of cbd, and legalizing cbd has become sort of an entry-level course for former drug warriors who are now inching toward drug policy reform. even chuck grassley (r-iowa), chairman of the senate judiciary committee and longtime bête noire of marijuana advocates, made an appearance at graham’s subcommittee hearing in july to express his support for legalizing cbd. but he made sure to limit his support to juvenile epileptics and “children who suffer from these rare conditions.” in essence, he was acknowledging the medical benefit of marijuana but reserving the right to determine which sick people deserve access to that medicine. graham’s open-mindedness on the issue goes back to an experience with his own mother, whose death he wrote about in an autobiography he released in the run-up to his presidential campaign. in my story, a 126-page e-book available on his website, graham relates in gripping detail his mother millie’s battle with stage iv hodgkin’s lymphoma, her quick wasting, how the doctors pronounced her dead, and how lindsey rushed to her bedside and revived her, if only for a few days. his mother, 56, told him, "lindsey, let me go.” after a week, during which the 21-year-old college student witnessed his mother convulse with seizures, graham, fighting back tears, told his mother: “okay, let go. we’ll be fine. let go.” “she smiled at me,” graham wrote, “and died five minutes later.” the book never delves into whether marijuana might have helped his mother (she died in 1976, decades before the debate would emerge so publicly), but the anecdote is just the kind of experience that could cause even a lobbyist-besieged senator to empathize with cancer survivors evangelizing the benefits of medical marijuana. so, i asked graham if that’s what happened with him. “absolutely,” he said, without hesitation. “i mean, chemotherapy—they kill you to make you better. and people who go through chemo treatment go through hell. if there's an application of the marijuana plant that can help patients like that? i know they need all the help they can get. i just want to make sure we do it based on science, but that is a worthy goal....sign me up.” *** but graham’s votes haven’t always matched his thinking on the issue. it took some gentle nudging from don murphy, director of conservative outreach for the marijuana policy project, to get graham’s votes to reflect his rhetoric. it was the morning of june 11, 2015, when murphy said he caught graham in the hallway before graham went into a meeting of the senate appropriations committee to vote. graham asked murphy, “how you doing?” and murphy seized the opening. “well, that depends on how you vote on my amendment.” “well, what amendment is that?” “it’s the medical marijuana amendment,” murphy recalls telling graham, “and i’ve read that you’ve made certain positive statements about the states making these decisions and patients making these decisions, and i hope your vote reflects your previous statements.” indeed, in february 2014, graham had told wbtv in charlotte, north carolina: “…when it comes to medicinal marijuana and this [cbd] oil, i think politicians should embrace what makes sense….this is about families with sick children.” in effect, graham was making favorable statements for more than a year before murphy grabbed him in the hallway. he just wasn’t voting that way. murphy reminded him of this, he said, eliciting polite nods from graham as the senator clutched the doorknob of the committee room before disappearing inside. murphy’s amendment, sponsored by sen. barbara mikulski (d-md.), aimed at restricting federal law enforcement from meddling with state-legal medical marijuana programs. it passed the senate appropriations committee that day by a vote of 21-9, with eight republicans in favor. at the end of the meeting, murphy was ecstatic, shaking hands and thanking members, but then he was disappointed to see that graham had voted no by proxy. later that day, while roaming the halls on the second floor of the russell office building, murphy said he just happened to bump into graham and a staffer as they left his office. graham was holding a laundered shirt on a hanger, which impressed murphy because graham hadn’t delegated that chore to his staffer. “how you doing?” graham asked murphy, recognizing him from earlier. “well, i’d be doing better if, you know, i thought i’d get your vote.” “what do you mean?” graham said. “you voted no by proxy." graham looked at his staffer and said, “i did?” and the staffer said, “yeah, you did.” in long committee meetings, it's not uncommon for a member to step out for a few minutes and for a staffer seated behind the member to indicate with a head nod to the chair how the member intended to vote for a particular amendment. in this case, graham's staffer guessed incorrectly. “what!?” graham said. “i didn’t want to do that!” and right there, graham pulled out his flip phone and called the clerk to change his vote, but it was too late. from that moment on, graham was thinking about the issue in a new way. about six months later, murphy was in new hampshire lobbying presidential candidates for the marijuana policy project and he bumped into graham at a jeb bush rally, just a few weeks after graham had suspended his own campaign. graham came up to murphy and told him, “i’m on that bill!”—meaning the carers act, which caught murphy off-guard because it’s his job to know these things. he went back to his hotel that night and looked it up on his laptop and didn’t see graham’s name listed as a co-sponsor, so the next day he hunted graham down and found him at another jeb rally. “senator, respectfully, i don’t see your name on there,” murphy said. “it’s on there! i promise you, it’s on there!” graham insisted. for whatever bureaucratic reason, graham’s name wasn’t officially added to the co-sponsor list until march 10, a month after the new hampshire primary. *** on july 13, 6&frac12; months after graham withdrew from the presidential race and six months after he saw don murphy in new hampshire, graham chaired the senate’s first-ever hearing on medical marijuana. murphy was sitting in the gallery. about an hour into the hearing, graham shuffled through his papers, found what he was looking for, and holding it up, he said, “i don’t mean to advertise for this guy, but dr. reefer—”displaying a photo of a pot leaf-emblazoned billboard for a las vegas-area business that provides medical marijuana cards to qualifying residents. “he has a billboard. i think this is in las vegas," graham said, eliciting enough laughs from the gallery to wake the room up. graham entered dr. reefer into the record to demonstrate that some states’ medical marijuana programs “have not gone down the scientific route,” and he called dr. reefer a prime example of a bad actor using medical marijuana as a fig leaf to cover, in graham’s words, “de facto backdoor legalization” of marijuana for recreational use. for graham, the medical marijuana issue is a spectrum: on one end are the juvenile epileptics who need cbd, who he supports without reservation, and on the other end is dr. reefer, an operation that graham sees as making a mockery of medical marijuana in order to legitimize criminal activity. during his hearing, practically in real time, it appeared graham was trying to determine where along that spectrum he felt comfortable landing. graham was introduced to the problem of dr. reefer by miriam adelson, a medical doctor and an addiction researcher who is also the wife of billionaire casino magnate sheldon adelson. “they said, 'this is not what you want,’” graham tells politico magazine. “and i got a bunch of stuff from california, too. but the dr. reefer was just too easy, so i chose him.” a lawmaker looking for clarity on this issue isn’t likely to get much help from the adelsons, who have taken seemingly contradictory positions on medical marijuana. the dr. miriam and sheldon g. adelson medical research foundation studies medical marijuana in its facility in tel aviv, but just two years ago, in 2014, sheldon adelson, one of the most prolific donors to conservative causes, gave the anti-medical marijuana campaign in florida $5.5 million. the las vegas review journal flipped its editorial position on marijuana from pro to con after adelson purchased the newspaper. in september, the adelsons reinforced their commitment to fight medical marijuana with an additional $1 million to fight legalization in florida. “the adelsons are strong opponents of medical marijuana,” says michael collins of the drug policy alliance. miriam adelson has not responded to a request for comment from politico magazine. craig moon, publisher of the review journal , replied in an email, “the editorial board reports to me, i believe that nevadans should vote no on the recreational marijuana amendment. the adelson family also shares my view.” dr. reefer is not a real person; it’s a business that doesn’t grow or sell any marijuana. since it opened in 2001, it charges patients a fee and provides them with a medical card that allows them to purchase marijuana legally at separate establishments. it was founded by a three-time felon who ran afoul of federal authorities in 2010, when he was caught overstepping the bounds of dr. reefer’s business model by selling marijuana directly to clients. dr. reefer continues its busy referral business with its provocative brand name under new ownership (whose identities are difficult to determine). “as for the billboards, it’s nothing new,” says derek sante, spokesman for dr. reefer. “those billboards have been up for more than a decade.” although advocates like don murphy have no love for the adelsons (“it’s heartless to support making criminals out of cancer patients, and that's what adelsons' position does”), murphy concedes that operations like dr. reefer remain an obstacle to his work. “look, he’s not wrong,” murphy said, referring to graham. “the nonsense that went on in california for years has made it very difficult for those of us who are advocating for legitimate medical marijuana patients.” but murphy goes on to connect the dots between bad state law and a paralyzed congress: “california happens because legislators don’t do their jobs.” “so, anyway,” murphy said, bringing it back around to the carers act hearing in july. “i’m real happy with lindsey graham.” like many activists who sat through graham’s historic senate hearing, murphy left that day feeling like graham meant business. “i do mean business,” graham told politico magazine. “sen. graham has gone above and beyond,” says murphy. “he just didn’t put his name on it [the carers act], he actually held a hearing. and i give him major props for that, and the hearing was pretty fair.” “what we're doing today is not enough,” graham said of the federal drug-law status quo. “we need to do more, and i just want to make sure that what we do doesn't get us to legitimizing the dr. reefers of the world.” on august 11, the dea refused to reclassify marijuana from schedule i to the less-severe schedule ii, as the carers bill would do, but did promise to accept applications for licensed growing operations in order to improve access to research-quality marijuana. it didn’t indicate how many applications it would approve. (graham has not responded to requests for comment regarding the dea’s decision.) unless something changes in the lame-duck session, the likelihood the carers act gets a vote in this congress remains close to zero; the fight over supreme court nominee merrick garland is all the senate judiciary committee is focused on. while the carers act's progress is historic, it's still just a marijuana bill on capitol hill. and the lame-duck session could indeed follow a landslide of state-level marijuana victories that could rattle even the most steadfast drug-war loyalist. medical marijuana will be on the ballot in arkansas, florida, montana and north dakota, while full colorado-style legalization will be on the ballot in california, arizona, maine, massachusetts and nevada, where voters could render dr. reefer and his "de facto legalization" scheme beside the point. but don murphy of mpp is having a field day with it. he tells all the republican lawmakers in states where it's on the ballot: "i bet you marijuana gets more votes than you do."      lindsey graham’s mind-expanding pot journey      
__label__0 hillary clinton got a major boost in august from some of her richest and most loyal supporters, with 11 seven-figure checks to fuel a spending surge from the main super pac supporting her candidacy. priorities usa action raised $23.4 million in august, more than half of which came from its top five donors, according to its monthly report filed tuesday with the federal election commission. it was the super pac's best fundraising month by far, more than doubling july's take. story continued below slim-fast founder daniel abraham and newsweb chairman fred eychaner each gave $3 million. billionaire financier george soros kicked in $2.5 million, and investor donald sussman and laurene powell jobs' emerson collective both added $2 million. sussman's latest gift brings his tally for the cycle to $13 million, the most of any of clinton's benefactors. working for working americans, the service employees international union committee on political education, the national air traffic controllers association pac, investor henry laufer and his wife, marsha, all gave $1 million. the super pac took advantage of the influx to step up its spending, dropping $20.6 million and ending the month with $41.5 million on hand, according to the report. it paid buzzfeed $1 million for digital ads, $405,400 to global strategy group for research and consultant travel, $247,600 to ralston lapp media for video production and media consulting, and $234,400 to shorr johnson magnus for the same. the report showed a $28,000 payment to crowdstrike, the cybersecurity firm that has also been serving the democratic national committee in the aftermath of its email hack. the pac spent $15,600 at the ritz carlton philadelphia, where top donors and fundraisers stayed during the democratic national convention. priorities usa transferred $6.5 million to five other political groups: immigrant voters win pac, latino victory fund, planned parenthood action fund, votevets and women vote.      big money fuels clinton super pac surge      
__label__0 new york — reporters traveling with hillary clinton got a taste of the egyptian security state on monday — and they didn't much care for it. the democratic presidential candidate was meeting monday evening in new york city with egypt's increasingly authoritarian president, abdel fattah al-sisi. story continued below according to the press pool report, upon reaching the hotel, the journalists were ordered to leave their bags, phones and computers with campaign staff "outside of the zone that had been deemed secure." "reporters had to argue with egyptian security to even carry recorders on their person," the pool report states. "there were also repeated arguments between clinton campaign staff and the egyptian security officials about how many reporters could enter the meeting despite having already reached an agreement with the country’s protocol officer prior to our arrival." campaign staffers, as well as a secret service agent, were with the reporters the entire time. at one point, the journalists got stuck on an elevator with former undersecretary of state wendy sherman, who now advises the clinton campaign — "we all got cozy," the pool report states. regardless of who they were with, the reporters went through multiple security sweeps and, at one point, ordered to wait behind a divider. "because of our positioning, we were unable to see hrc when she arrived, as previously noted, and without our phones we couldn’t keep track of time," the pool report notes. sisi, a former general, took power in egypt in 2013 after massive popular protests forced out the elected government of muslim brotherhood leader mohamed morsi. during his session with clinton, which lasted more than an hour, sisi at one point said he wished to talk “about the path that we are taking in order to build up a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law, that respects human rights and liberties." but sisi is increasingly viewed as a serial human rights violator. clinton's decision to meet with him signifies the importance the u.s. places on its alliance with egypt, a relatively stable country in a chaotic middle east. but she's already drawn criticism from both liberals and conservatives for sitting down with sisi.      clinton press poolers clash with egyptian leader's security      
__label__0 former president george h.w. bush is bucking his party's presidential nominee and plans to vote for hillary clinton in november, according to a member of another famous political family, the kennedys. bush, 92, had intended to stay silent on the white house race between clinton and donald trump, a sign in and of itself of his distaste for the gop nominee. but his preference for the wife of his own successor, president bill clinton, nonetheless became known to a wider audience thanks to kathleen hartington kennedy townsend, the former maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late robert f. kennedy. story continued below on monday, townsend posted a picture on her facebook page shaking hands next to the former president and this caption: "the president told me he’s voting for hillary!!” in a telephone interview, townsend said she met with the former president in maine earlier today, where she said he made his preference known that he was voting for a democrat. “that’s what he said,” she told politico. asked about townsend’s post, george h.w. bush spokesman jim mcgrath in an email replied, "the vote president bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days. he is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim." george h.w. bush and former first lady barbara bush have stayed out of the political debate since campaigning earlier this year for their son jeb's unsuccessful bid for president. neither george h.w. bush nor his son, former president george w. bush, attended this summer's republican national convention in cleveland where trump accepted the nomination. many former gop officials from both bush administrations have also announced their support for clinton over trump, including national security adviser brent scowcroft and former commerce secretary carlos gutierrez. one bush official who has taken trump's side is former vice president dan quayle, who told politico in an interview this summer he was still holding out hope both bushes would back trump.

__label__0 philadelphia—juliette comfer, a pink-haired freshman at temple university, was wild for bernie sanders. now she’s mild for hillary clinton. “i don’t love her, but our views are aligned,” she said before clinton made a pitch for millennial votes at her school on monday. orion tucker, a junior with a nose ring and a hipster goatee, also felt the bern in the democratic primary, but he’s also backing clinton over donald trump: “the more donald runs off his mouth, the clearer the choice gets.” philip mattes, a freshman with a scruffy orange beard, is another bernie bro who’s transferred to the clinton train. “if you care about health care, student debt, all the progressive issues, you’ve got to be with her,” he said. polls suggest that most millennials prefer clinton to trump, but especially among college-aged voters who tend to lean left, her margin isn’t nearly as wide as president obama’s over mitt romney. and you could sense why at her speech on monday. the carefully curated crowd was clearly on her side—there were only about 200 attendees, many of them members of democratic campus groups who got tickets from her campaign—but the enthusiasm was not exactly overwhelming story continued below in interviews at the event, many of her millennial supporters, especially the former sanders revolutionaries, talked about her in the could-be-worse tone they might use to describe a boring but socially appropriate romantic partner. they used words like “capable,” “well-informed,” “responsible,” and “qualified.” they dutifully praised her positions on issues like abortion, student debt, mass incarceration, and climate change, while emphasizing the importance of stopping trump and his inflammatory rhetoric. but most of them did not sound particularly inspired. “bernie was a genuine grass-roots kind of guy, and he really spoke to the younger generation,” said nicole brigstock, a freshman at the university of pennsylvania who wore a “no war” pin next to her “ready for hillary” pin. “he truly cared about progressive issues. i guess i’d like to believe that she does as well.” clinton’s campaign staff acknowledges that after losing millennials to sanders by blowout margins in the democratic primary, she’s still underperforming in that age group in the general. they described the temple speech as an effort to earn the votes of young people who might not know where she stands on issues like equal pay for women, gay rights, the minimum wage, and college affordability. she also appealed to their sense of tolerance and multiculturalism, attacking trump as a racist, sexist, and generally divisive figure, repeatedly pushing her campaign themes of stronger together and love trumps hate. the conventional wisdom on millennials is that they’re swayed more by passion and emotion than substance—that in politics as well as smartphones, they’re always looking for the shiny new thing. but coming of age with the first black president, very few of them expressed excitement about the prospect of the first woman president. on the other hand, her young supporters here almost all name-checked her more traditional liberal views, in contrast to trump’s calls to build a wall and undo most of obama’s work, as well as her knowledge of policy, in even sharper contrast to trump. in her speech, clinton admitted she’s not much of an entertainer, but touted her commitment to the “slow, hard business of governing,” pointing out that she knows the interest rate on student loans down to the decimal point. “she’s showing that she’s experienced, she’s reality-based, she cares about policies we care about,” said junior mike mcdermott, a former sanders supporter who’s on the executive board of the temple democrats. “young people want to see that kind of positive message. it’s not sexy, but it’s about getting the job done.” margaret strolle, a graduate student in history at villanova, said clinton gets a bad rap from starry-eyed sanders types who think politics is about waving magic wands and making everything better. she said clinton is a realist, and like alexander hamilton in the broadway musical, has been in the room where it happens. “people deride her for being part of the system but i like her experience,” strolle said. “she’s not making big promises about how she’s going to change everything, but she’s committed to getting things done, even if it’s incremental.” trump is wildly unpopular with millennials, so the real danger for clinton is that they could vote for third-party candidates or stay home, and she warned monday that trump could win if the youth turnout is stagnant. judging from the students at her event, that might be her strongest millennial message. tom quinn, a nursing student and a registered independent who had considered voting for libertarian gary johnson, says he’s now convinced that only two candidates have a path to victory, and that trump is unacceptable. “we can’t have a racist president,” he said. bernie mann, a diehard sanders supporter—she noted they even share a name—said she’s realized she can vote for his platform by voting for clinton: “it felt a lot more real from bernie, but she’s way, way, way better than trump.” vicki gouvalis, a moderate republican and voted for john kasich in the primary, said she was undecided before clinton spoke, then told me after the event she will vote for clinton. “i was shocked by how much i agreed with her,” gouvalis said. the good news for clinton is she has room to grow with undecided millennials who loathe trump and share many of her views. the bad news is that many of them are undecided because they don’t like her or trust her. several clinton supporters who showed up monday said they’re still concerned about her emails, her support for the iraq war, and her ties to wall street. they said most of their bernie-or-bust friends are coming around as the election nears, but not all of them. “everyone keeps saying she’s a liar, and i’m like, what politician isn’t?” said jeffrey fuentes, a junior whose parents are salvadoran immigrants. “i think people will come around, but they’re not amped up like they were for bernie.” at temple, clinton tried to reach out to reluctant millennials, telling unusually personal stories about her mother and other women who influenced her, urging them to resist the notion that politics is all corrupt and no one ever changes. and there was one group of millennials at the event whose enthusiasm seemed to defy all the punditry: young black voters, who never felt the bern in the first place. james walton, a 30-year-old buyer for a philadelphia manufacturing company, said african-americans appreciate clinton’s attention to the minimum wage, police brutality, and gun control; he’s lost three friends to gun violence. “we’re millennials, too,” he said. “and she’s speaking to our demographic.” jeanmarie elican, a senior at the university of pennsylvania, said that as a black woman, she appreciates clinton’s concern about discrimination against minorities, immigrants and gays. but like so many of her fellow clinton supporters, she said she’s most energized about stopping trump, a candidate who has dismissed black lives matter, retweeted white supremacists, and argued that blacks should vote for him because their lives are so abysmal they have nothing to lose. “i have plenty to lose,” elican said. “donald trump doesn’t see black people as people. if that’s not a reason to vote, i don’t know what is.”      millennials go mild for hillary      
__label__0 new york — there's at least one muslim country that donald trump has "great respect" for. the republican presidential nominee monday showered egypt's increasingly autocratic ruler, abdel fattah al-sisi, with kind words during a special meeting on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly. story continued below trump, who has called for a ban on immigration from countries "compromised by terrorism," which presumably would include egypt, promised to invite sisi to visit the white house if he's elected president. trump also suggested he'd like to visit egypt. in a strikingly praise-filled summary of the meeting released by his campaign, the republican was said to express to sisi "his strong support for egypt’s war on terrorism, and how under a trump administration, the united states of america will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that egypt can count on in the days and years ahead." trump also was said to have "emphasized" to sisi "his high regard for peace-loving muslims." the statement came the same day that the real estate mogul, responding to a suspected terrorist attack in new york, lamented that police officers weren't allowed to use racial profiling. sisi also met with democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton. both the 2016 candidates have been criticized by people across the political spectrum for sparing any time for sisi, whose harsh rule has infuriated human rights activists. but egypt is still considered a vital ally for the united states, not least because it maintains a peace deal with israel and is a relatively stable arab country in an increasingly volatile middle east. it also is considered an important partner in the battle against islamist militancy. the meeting between trump and sisi also included trump advisers, sen. jeff sessions (r-ala.) and retired lt. gen. michael flynn, former director of the defense intelligence agency. according to the readout, trump expressed "great respect for egypt’s history" and a "great fondness" for the egyptian people. the readout did not say what sisi said in return to trump. egyptian officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment monday from politico.      trump praises autocratic egyptian leader      
__label__0 new york — staring down tightening polls both nationwide and in the battleground states, hillary clinton’s campaign manager robby mook on monday circulated a private memo to donors, supporters and top volunteers that maps out the democratic nominee’s various paths to the white house in november, paired with his analysis of donald trump’s own precarious path. “here’s the story that no poll can tell: hillary clinton has many paths to 270 electoral votes, while donald trump has very few. hillary is nearly certain to win 16 ‘ blue' states, including washington d.c., which will garner her 191 electoral votes,” writes mook in the nearly 2,000-word memo that was blasted out in the early evening, and which was obtained by politico. “if we add the five states that fivethirtyeight.com gives hillary a 70% or greater chance of winning (michigan, minnesota, pennsylvania, virginia, and wisconsin), hillary only needs 10 more electoral votes." story continued below writing at a time when democrats are growing increasingly nervous about the state of the race — and as leading party members like president barack obama and clinton herself are loudly warning that the vote is going to be close — mook then runs down the possibilities for clinton to win the remaining 10 electoral votes: taking florida’s 29 electoral votes, north carolina’s 15, ohio’s 18, or any two of colorado, new hampshire, iowa, or nevada. “put a different way, of these battleground states, hillary can win just one (florida, ohio, or north carolina) and win the presidency, which means the six additional states would only add more electoral votes to her total,” he writes. “donald trump, on the other hand, must win six of these seven states, including florida, north carolina, and ohio — none of which he can lose." mook’s analysis tracks with what top party strategists have been saying about the democrat-republican split for months, though it clashes with the trump team’s own inclusion of pennsylvania in the battleground mix. clinton, for her part, has also drilled down on that state, calculating that it should go her way but that the republican’s chances are nearly nonexistent without it. titled “50 days until election day,” the memo serves in part as a way to calm down hand-wringing party members who are increasingly concerned that trump is gaining on clinton — her lead in the four-way realclearpolitics national average is 0.7 points, down from its peak of 7.6 in early august. but the note is also a rallying mechanism, urging supporters to make more calls and knock on more doors in the homestretch. it runs through some of clinton’s policy positions and some standard knocks on trump — including quoting gop house speaker paul ryan, who this summer said trump’s insistence that a judge of mexican heritage couldn’t be unbiased in a case involving the candidate is “the textbook definition of a racist comment.” but it doesn’t stray far from clinton’s public line, except to go hard negative against clinton’s opponent at a time she is striving to push a more affirmative, not just anti-trump, message. the missive also identifies some of democrats’ structural and infrastructural advantages, such as the higher proportions of young voters and people of color in the battlegrounds than in 2012, before — in a tried-and-true campaign maneuver, taking pains to calm backers by dismissing public polls and the media. “you’ve heard us say many times that public polls must be taken with a grain of salt, but here’s why we should just dump out the entire salt shaker: in early september, an abc/news washington post poll showed hillary leading by eight points. four days later, reuters/ipsos released a poll saying hillary’s lead was only one point. here’s my favorite: earlier this month, a cbs/yougov poll showed hillary winning ohio by seven points (46-39) and three days later a bloomberg poll came out showing trump winning ohio by five (44-39),” mook writes. “a swing of 12 points in three days? go figure. is ohio a very close contest? yes. battleground states carry that name for a reason: they’re going to be close, from now until election day."      clinton campaign memo outlines map to victory      
__label__0 donald trump’s campaign is claiming vindication after one of hillary clinton’s longtime confidants was accused last week of spreading false rumors about barack obama’s origins during the 2008 democratic primary. but the real story turns out to be a little more complicated, and does nothing to prove trump’s argument that clinton and her campaign “started” the so-called birther controversy. story continued below last thursday, after former mcclatchy editor james asher tweeted that clinton associate sidney blumenthal “told me in person” that obama was born in kenya, the trump campaign pounced. “siren: former mcclatchy dc bureau chief speaks out,” senior communications adviser jason miller tweeted. mcclatchy followed up with a story that quoted a statement from asher, “during that meeting, mr. blumenthal and i met together in my office and he strongly urged me to investigate the exact place of president obama’s birth, which he suggested was in kenya. we assigned a reporter to go to kenya, and that reporter determined that the allegation was false.” blumenthal swiftly denied pushing any birther rumors. and asher, when pressed for more detail, was less definitive in an email to politico. “to the best of my recollection, these are the facts about my interaction with sidney blumenthal in late winter of 2008,” asher said. “blumenthal visited the washington bureau of mcclatchy, where he and i met in my office. during that conversation and in subsequent communications, we discussed a number of matters related to obama. he encouraged mcclatchy to do stories related to obama and his connections to kenya.” “on the birther issue, i recall my conversation with blumenthal clearly,” asher said, but acknowledged having “nothing in writing memorializing that conversation.” “this story is false,” blumenthal reiterated in an email. “i never spoke to mr. asher about this. period. donald trump cannot distract from the inescapable fact that he is the one who embraced and promoted the birther lie and is responsible for it.” “well i still have his biz card. so it's his word against mine,” asher tweeted on friday after other news outlets published blumenthal’s initial denial. but two other former mcclatchy staffers, including mcclatchy’s nairobi correspondent at the time, shashank bengali, said they were aware that asher and blumenthal were in touch. “sid was definitely speaking to asher,” bengali said. bengali, who is now a los angeles times correspondent based in mumbai, said he had been asked to investigate “obama’s kenya ties” at blumenthal’s behest, but couldn’t remember whether anyone had asked him “to check out the birther angle specifically. no one in kenya took that seriously." “what i remember is that you told me to look into everything about obama's family in kenya. i can't recall if we specifically discussed the birther claim, but i'm sure that was part of what i researched,” bengali said in an email to asher that was shared with politico. bengali interviewed obama's siblings and friends of his father, but came up empty. “there was nothing there. we didn't even publish a story," he said. blumenthal won’t say if the meeting with asher ever happened, but did not deny urging him in an email to have bengali report on whether obama had offended kenyans by making disparaging remarks about his late father, an economist who once worked for the kenyan government. the email, which was dated march 17, 2008, and shared with politico, reads: "jim, on kenya your person in the field might look into the impact there of obama's public comments about his father. i'm told by state dept officials that obama publicly derided his father on his visit there and that was regarded as embarrassing and crossing the line by kenyans for whom respect for elders (especially the father, especially a muslim father, in a patrilineal society) is considered sacrosanct. sidney" asher says he also asked bengali, after discussing the matter with blumenthal, to look into “any connections between obama and raila odinga, who had described himself as obama’s cousin and would run for president of kenya; and, second, possible relationships between odinga and unspecified controversial muslim groups.” asked about the email, blumenthal would not clarify the nature of his interactions with asher. but he wrote, “what you sent has nothing to do with birtherism at all. it is untrue i had anything to do with birtherism. obama's relationship with his father is at the heart of his memoir, ‘dreams of my father,’ and has been a commonplace subject of interest for everyone.” nor would blumenthal say if he had discussed ties between obama and odinga with asher. “i can say with certainty that i never trafficked in birtherism,” he repeated when asked. blumenthal sent along an email he sent to friends in february 2011, pointing to politico’s write-up of a poll showing that half of republican primary voters at the time that obama was born abroad. he said his subject line -- “it's official: they're nuts” -- “reflects my constant view of the matter.” he also pointed to a series of tweets asher made in which he attacked clinton in strident terms and used a pro-trump hashtag. ”#snowden should be pardoned since #hillary wasn't #indicted. only fair! #wikileaks #election2016,” one tweet reads. “#hillaryclinton #election2016 #trumppence16 note colin #powell's reference to #hrc's #‘character,’" reads another. a third tweet reads: “what is really going on with #hillaryclinton? #election2016 #hillaryshealth.” asked about those tweets on monday, asher said, “i support neither trump nor clinton. it would be incorrect to read support for trump into my tweets about clinton.” the conflicting accounts came after trump on friday accused clinton of starting what he called “the ‘birther’ controversy” -- a campaign of scurrilous rumor-mongering that he did more than anyone to stoke, only to concede last week that he was mistaken. the clinton campaign’s response to trump’s charge came fast and furious, and politico found no evidence to suggest that the former secretary of state or her 2008 operation ever trafficked in birther rumors. "as multiple, independent fact checkers have affirmed in the years since, neither the 2008 campaign nor the candidate ever questioned the president's citizenship or birth certificate,” clinton press secretary brian fallon said when asked about blumenthal, who was never paid by the 2008 clinton campaign. indeed, clinton’s former campaign manager, patty solis doyle, told cnn on friday that she fired a volunteer coordinator in iowa who had forwarded a birther-esque email, calling it “so beyond the pale of the campaign hillary wanted to run.” blumenthal, a longtime confidant of both bill and hillary clinton, emerged as a frequent correspondent in the former secretary of state’s email records, peppering her with hundreds of notes offering advice, sharing tart observations about her administration rivals, or passing along articles and “intelligence” reports from his contacts. he also sometimes boasted of having planted articles in the press on her behalf, though there is no evidence that she ever asked him to do so. blumenthal’s relationship with the clintons dates back to their battles with the right-wing media during the 1990s, in which he was a sharp-elbowed participant. after writing a well-received book about those years, “the clinton wars,” he returned briefly to journalism before playing an informal advisory role during the 2008 campaign. he sought a job in the state department when clinton was named secretary of state, but white house aides blacklisted him due to his role in pushing negative stories about obama during the democratic primary. he remained in the clinton orbit, however: in 2009, the clinton foundation put him on its staff and paid him $10,000 per month, though the arrangement ended in march 2015. blumenthal then did consulting work for american bridge, correct the record and media matters, three groups that support clinton’s presidential bid and are run by another close clinton ally, david brock. in a portion of a deposition that was accidently put online, blumenthal told a congressional committee that he was paid around $200,000 by the brock groups. hillary clinton has never repudiated blumenthal, though she has distanced herself from him, while he has continued to be her ardent defender. as recently as may, he described himself as a “friend” of clinton’s, though he did not say whether they still exchange emails. in her testimony before the house benghazi committee last year, clinton described him as a “personal friend” but downplayed the extent to which she relied on him for advice as secretary of state. "he was not advising me," clinton told the committee. "i did not ask him to send me the information that he sent me," she said, though the emails show that she did sometimes thank him for the information or ask him to “please keep them coming.” she also sometimes forwarded his emails and asked state department officials to look into his findings. during her subsequent interview with the fbi, clinton described him as “a prodigious writer whose information was sometimes accurate and sometimes not,” according to the bureau’s report summarizing its investigation into her private email server. when blumenthal’s emails first emerged, clinton was slightly less circumspect. “he sent me unsolicited emails, which i passed on in some instances, and i say that that’s just part of the give and take,” she told reporters last year. “i have many, many old friends and i always think that it’s important when you get into politics to have friends you had before you were in politics and to understand what’s on their minds,” clinton said. “and he’s been a friend of mine for a long time.”      did sid blumenthal really push birtherism?      
__label__0 john mccain has made 3 million voter contacts in arizona. rob portman marshaled 500 college interns to make phone calls and knock on doors in ohio. and pat toomey barnstormed 26 pennsylvania counties this summer in a bus plastered with the words “security, prosperity, independence.” then there’s richard burr. story continued below republicans are privately fretting that the laid-back burr isn’t campaigning aggressively enough for his third senate term and potentially risking a gop seat that the party should otherwise have in the bag. but — in his usual easygoing form — burr brushed off any concerns about national democrats spending at least $6.7 million to unseat him — a forceful play to make a red-leaning state competitive less than two months before the election. “it’s great. i think anytime they waste money it saves my colleagues from having it go after them,” burr smirked when asked of democrats’ money blitz. “am i complaining that the last [quinnipiac] poll had me up 6? no! i’m probably in better shape than we dreamed.” the senate intelligence chairman risks getting caught flat-footed against a relatively unknown opponent in north carolina, which has become a major target for democrats eyeing the white house, senate and the governor’s mansion in raleigh. but burr comes by his laid-back attitude honestly — quirks and all. he doesn’t wear socks, except on certain thursdays. he’ll bring his own lunch to caucus meetings to save a few bucks on the catered food and sometimes walks around the capitol chowing on grits. and he drives a ramshackle convertible volkswagen thing in rain, sun and snow despite the inoperable roof, leaving it in areas that could not even under the most charitable definition be called a parking spot. the car is covered with bumper stickers, including one supporting conservative democratic sen. joe manchin of west virginia. “the best way to describe richard is to look at the car he drives,” said sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.), a longtime friend. “he’s a workhorse, not a show horse. if you don’t believe me go look at his car. which is a piece of crap.” but no matter how well-liked burr is, he’s in a competitive race against democrat deborah ross, a former state representative who has sneaked up on burr and trails by about 3 points according to averages of recent polls. and national democrats are going after him because ohio has essentially been conceded to the republicans, florida is exceedingly expensive and they are searching for any path to the majority. the race is viewed as an essential piece of either party’s majority: if democrats can’t take advantage of burr’s vulnerability, party honchos will kick themselves for leaving a winnable seat on the table. and if republicans were to lose in north carolina, it would presage a bad night for them on nov. 8. plus, the state’s environment is rapidly deteriorating around burr. gop gov. pat mccrory appears the most vulnerable incumbent governor, donald trump is being badly outspent by hillary clinton and the gop’s so-called bathroom law is now denying the state prized ncaa tournament events. burr again declined to take a position on the controversial law, known as hb2, last week. “the state is on fire,” ross said in a telephone interview. “north carolina has the most statewide races that are the closest in the entire country right now.” the political landscape is threatening enough, but gop insiders say burr has exacerbated the problem by never deviating from his lax demeanor. burr says this is his last political campaign ever -- but republicans privately say it’s hard to tell how much he cares about the outcome. “in this environment you would prefer to have all of your candidates running terrified, and no one would say that he is doing that,” said one top republican strategist. “he’s not working as hard as he should,” added another. burr attended a senate republican fundraiser on sea island, ga., as his colleagues spent the past weekend campaigning. burr “should have been in north carolina,” said a third republican strategist. the senator himself said that national republicans don’t understand his strategy. his aides said he did 26 events in the first three weeks of august, though at one of them he told the associated press that he doesn’t become a candidate until the senate goes on recess in october. was that a mistake? “absolutely not. has my campaign been running? yeah it’s been running. when do i have time to go down and be a candidate? i’ve got a full-time job up here,” burr said. “what i was trying to say was, i go out and do senate business, don’t come up and ask me campaign questions. because i’m not a candidate, i’m doing official business.” the 60-year-old burr is something of a throwback on capitol hill, a longtime friend of former house speaker john boehner (r-ohio) who views politicking a distant second to the daily ins-and-outs of being a powerful intel chairman. a national sales manager for a lawn equipment distributor before entering politics, burr ran unsuccessfully for congress in 1992, but won a house seat just two years later and served there for a decade before running for the senate in 2004. burr is boosted by the fact that he’s well-respected by democrats — the biggest diss that democratic senators can come up with is that he’s not well-known in the state. in a september suffolk poll, burr was unknown by 13 percent of respondents, but ross was worse off with 45 percent of them saying they’d never heard of her. still, he led by 3 points in that survey, and ross has more room to grow her support. “the more they see of her, the more they’re going to like her,” said one democratic senator. “i don’t know the state of his campaign, i just know there’s a lot of persuadables in north carolina.” the most stunning sign of gop hand-wringing is an $8.1 million ad buy reserved by the senate leadership fund — more than the group is spending on races in the traditional battlegrounds of nevada and pennsylvania. and according to republican officials, pro-trump forces have reserved only $3.2 million in ads in the state, while pro-clinton forces have reserved $21.2 million. republicans supporting burr and the candidate himself, however, have about $20 million in ads scheduled to run this year, compared with about $9 million for democrats. and burr has a built-in money advantage, with $7 million on hand to ross’ $2 million at the end of june, and is now up on tv. but burr has been hampered by another troubling statistic: ross outraised him the past two quarters, a major accomplishment for a candidate in a first-time race and a troubling one for a longtime politician. democrats say they have benefited from ross’ obscurity; had former sen. kay hagan (d-n.c.) or former rep. heath shuler (d-n.c.) got in the race, burr may have been startled into an overwhelming show of force early on. but now in the midst of the sprint to november, ross is in serious contention. “she’s very good. she’s very sharp,” said democratic senatorial campaign committee chairman jon tester of montana. “the next seven weeks are critical, but she’s a great candidate and she’s absolutely in the mix. seven weeks is a long time, but i think that long time helps her a lot.” republicans read things another way -- that they will use the next seven weeks to stir up inflammatory pieces of ross’ record, which includes running the state’s american civil liberties union, opposing a sex-offender registry and efforts to ban flag burning. gop sen. thom tillis of north carolina called her a “no-compromises ultraliberal” – and republicans said after they are done with her, voters will figure she’s too left for the red-leaning state. “that state is competitive. it is a must-win for us,” said national republican senatorial committee chairman roger wicker (r-miss.). “we’re going to spend a lot of money pointing out the shortcomings of ms. ross, of which there are many, too numerous to mention for the rest of the [election]. and i know that some of our friends have stated publicly that they intend to do that.” wicker himself refused to concede that burr isn’t working hard enough. and worries about burr in washington strategy rooms is nothing new. his first senate campaign in 2004 was characterized by his lone ranger style as he bombed around the state, often alone, to events, republicans recounted. by 2010 he’d done little to elevate his stature, yet cruised to reelection as part of the tea party wave with the same relaxed demeanor. “this happens every six years,” remarked a fourth top gop operative. this year, though, is different. the dscc’s commitment is a major development in the race; burr faced essentially no attacks from outside groups in 2010. and the presidential tossup in combination with burr’s under-the-radar stature means he’s likely to lose his seat if clinton bests trump. yet burr is as carefree as ever, moseying through the capitol halls alone, without aides or talking points to dispense. and since he’s not listening to campaign officials, republicans have no other solution other than to trust that he knows what he’s doing. “that sometimes makes the experts uneasy,” said rep. richard hudson (r-n.c.).      gop panics over n.c. senate race      
__label__0 house republicans already struggling to protect their historic majority this fall are confronting a multimillion-dollar shortfall in their campaign budget — driven partly by freedom caucus members and other hard-line conservatives who are boycotting the gop’s campaign arm. a bloc of conservatives is refusing to transfer cash to the national republican congressional committee, convinced the committee is favoring moderate candidates over hard-line conservatives. dozens of other republican lawmakers also haven’t paid their expected party “dues,” including several in tough primaries or general election races who figure they need the money for themselves. story continued below several gop sources told politico that 3 in 10 members of the house republican conference are delinquent on their dues. and multiple senior republicans said the shortfall exceeds $10 million. “there’s a group of us who associate the nrcc with the establishment wing of the party,” said rep. mick mulvaney (r-s.c.), who added that he has a “principled objection to paying dues to the nrcc.” the freedom caucus member noted that a former top nrcc staffer helped outside groups unseat his friend, rep. tim huelskamp of kansas, in a republican primary last month, and said the committee is partly to blame. (the nrcc doesn’t spend money in republican primaries and says it has no control over outside groups.) mulvaney also says he’s still upset by ads aired against him in early 2015 by american action network, a 501(c)(4) allied with then-speaker john boehner (r-ohio). the spots implored mulvaney and other conservatives to end their blockade of a spending bill backed by leadership. after that, several other freedom caucus members stopped paying dues. “there’s a group that’s still smarting from the fact some of our own went after us, and we’ll be damned if we’re going to put money back in their hands,” mulvaney said. the dispute, which one chief of staff for a house republican called a “brewing war,” is another sign that the schism between the activist and establishment wings of the house gop conference has spread to the campaign trail. over the summer, conservative- and establishment-aligned outside groups poured millions into primary showdowns between far-right and center-right candidates. now it’s continuing in the general election, as republicans are struggling to head off double-digit seat losses with donald trump leading their ticket. the refusal by conservatives to pay has enraged some house republicans, who say the nrcc and leadership have no control over outside groups. they also note that the nrcc helped many of the nonpaying members get elected in the first place. “politics is a team game and outside of the hfc, almost every member of the republican conference is busting his or her ass to raise money and get republicans elected,” said one senior republican. “the hfc has chosen not to raise money or help get other republicans elected, but for some reason they think they should control what the nrcc does or how it spends its money? that’s nuts.” while the nrcc has about $2.5 million more cash on hand than the democratic congressional campaign committee, house democrats outraised republicans by more than $11 million combined in july and august. a big chunk of the disparity is attributable to members not paying dues, several republican sources said. the nrcc would not comment on the dues figures provided to politico. it downplayed the conservative boycott, saying in a statement that “we are always very grateful to our conference for their commitment to ensuring we maintain and grow our historic republican house majority.” but the problem appears to be serious enough that gop leaders have pleaded with members several times in recent weeks to pony up. on a conference call with dozens of members the last week of august, speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) and nrcc chairman greg walden (r-ore.) urged lawmakers to donate. walden said republicans were getting outraised by democrats in both big and small donations, and ryan said he was disappointed in members who hadn’t paid their dues, encouraging them to work as a team. and at a closed-door gop conference meeting last week, ryan and his top lieutenants told members they need to meet their assessments to close the fundraising gap with the democrats. a powerpoint presentation highlighted members who were current on dues and those who hadn’t paid, according to sources in the room. multiple lawmakers and staffers also told politico the nrcc is cracking down on members who haven’t paid, even barring some from accessing committee resources or attending events until they do pay. one mid-august nrcc email to republican chiefs of staff invited them to a reception on a rooftop terrace in downtown washington, but only for “chiefs of members who have completed their assessments.” the same goes with lawmakers: country band big & rich headlined nrcc’s second annual “house party” last week at the hamilton restaurant in d.c. but emails inviting lawmakers in early september noted that “only members who are paid in full” on their dues can attend. dues are based on ability to pay, factoring in a member’s committee assignments and seniority. getting politicians to fork over their hard-raised cash is a recurring problem for the nrcc and dccc. but the shortfall this year is especially pressing for republicans — and increasingly appears to be based on ideological rivalries. a former nrcc staffer defended the committee, saying “many in the house freedom caucus would not be there if not for the nrcc.” the committee spent $1 million help elect mulvaney in 2010, the person said, among other caucus members who’ve benefited from the committee’s largesse. at the crux of the conservatives’ boycott is a belief the nrcc is now supporting moderates who back the party’s leadership against conservatives who push the party further to the right. “when those folks are going against us … would i support that with my money? no,” said rep. dave brat (r-va.), a freedom caucus member who upset majority leader eric cantor in a primary two years ago. some conservatives, including rep. jim jordan (r-ohio), have instead decided to transfer money to right-leaning candidates they personally support. if those contenders win the gop primary, it could mean more influence for conservatives. conservatives also suspect that leadership and the nrcc are behind outside establishment-aligned groups targeting the far right of the conference. when asked about nrcc dues, brat said it’s “illogical for me to fund ads against myself” — though the nrcc does not directly play in primaries. many conservatives are still furious with aan for the round of ads they ran in early 2015 — though the freedom caucus did not take an official position on the matter. aan told politico they have spent multiple times the amount of money on positive ads for some for these same members since early 2015, including 10 times in mulvaney's case. “i’m not sure how you use issue advocacy ads run for one day 18 months ago as an excuse not to pay political dues," said mike shields, president of american action network. gop leaders have told conservatives countless times they’re not trying to undercut them in campaigns, arguing they have no control over groups like the u.s. chamber of commerce that might decide to target a conservative in a primary. allies of leadership and the nrcc also note that one of the freedom caucus’ strongest outside allies, the conservative club for growth, has actively gone after sitting lawmakers, including rep. john shimkus (r-ill.). others republicans have been slow to contribute because they’re afraid for themselves. several lawmakers or top staffers for lawmakers who’ve faced tough primaries said the nrcc doesn’t help them when they’re challenged by fellow republicans. “they want you to give a lot of money, but it weakens you in defending yourself in the primary, and for us, the primary is where we live and die now,” said the chief of staff for one member who no longer pays his dues. in the meantime, top house republicans are donating millions above their dues assessments to compensate for the shortfall. ryan, for example, has transferred nearly $30 million alone. an altar call during last tuesday’s gop conference meeting, for example, brought more than $3 million, including $1.5 million from majority leader kevin mccarthy, $500,000 from house financial services chairman jeb hensarling of texas, $250,000 from budget chairman tom price of georgia and $200,000 from walden, sources in the room say. leaders were hoping to inspire more transfers. it’s unclear so far whether they’ve succeeded.      freedom caucus stiffs gop on campaign cash      
__label__0 there’s one state where donald trump’s ground game appears to be a model of efficiency, rather than a ramshackle operation lacking organizers and field offices: israel. as part of an effort to target what the israeli chapter of republicans overseas says are as many as 300,000 u.s. citizens living there — many of them registered in places ranging from safe democratic states like new york, new jersey and california to swing states like florida and pennsylvania — the pro-trump group is employing all the traditional tools long eschewed by the campaign itself. story continued below in some ways, the trump organizing efforts are more extensive in the west bank than in west palm beach, fla. while the trump campaign and its allies spent much of the summer waving off the importance of brick-and-mortar offices in the u.s., the israeli team is expanding its physical footprint. so far, there are five offices open in areas around jerusalem and tel aviv, as well as in the israeli-occupied west bank. and the group has plans to open three more offices starting as soon as this week: in gush etzion, which is also in the west bank, near jerusalem; and two others around jerusalem and tel aviv. there’s even coalition-specific engagement—a top adviser to the chief rabbi of israel is focused on courting the ultra-orthodox vote for trump, according to the campaign manager for the israel effort. compare that to the trump campaign in florida, for example, where there is little evidence of tailored jewish outreach at all, much less constituency-focused outreach to various jewish subgroups. marc zell, who heads up republicans overseas israel, said they are “closely coordinated” with both the rnc and the trump campaign on messaging. but the israeli-based trump effort is supported by local fundraising, not the gop nominee’s campaign or the rnc. a marco rubio backer in the gop primary, zell tried to resign his gop leadership position after trump won, he said, initially distraught over trump’s nomination. but zell has since come to support the republican nominee, heartened by the strong pro-israel language included in the platform passed at trump’s convention. many israelis who whole-heartedly embrace trump appreciate his tough talk on terrorism and the fact that he represents a clear break with the obama administration, which has had a tumultuous relationship with conservative israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu. one poll of israelis from june, however, found that 42 percent of israeli citizens overall would vote for hillary clinton if they were american citizens, and 35 percent would back trump. other organizations estimate that there are only around 200,000 u.s. citizens in israel. but whatever the number, the pro-trump forces are targeting a group that includes many orthodox jews, who tend to be more conservative — and more likely to vote for trump. “people, they…come back from work, they’re going to get help through the registration process from our specialists,” said tzvika brot, a former israeli journalist who is campaign manager of the israel effort. “every evening, we’ll come to that office or some base in the houses of our volunteers. we even appoint area captains for each area in israel.” to american political operatives who have worked with the jewish community stateside, the intensive israeli efforts to target u.s. citizens on trump’s behalf underscore how little the republican is doing to court jewish voters in key american swing states like ohio, pennsylvania and especially florida. “instead of focusing on expats who are floridians who live in ashdod [in israel], i would focus on jewish americans who live in boca raton,” said michael fragin, a consultant who worked on jewish outreach for the republican national committee in florida in 2004, and remains plugged in to the jewish political world. in the u.s., he continued, “nobody i know is aware of anything going on specific to jewish outreach.” added lisa spies, who ran jewish outreach for mitt romney and remains heavily involved on the pro-israel donor landscape: “with trump, yes, there are pro-israel republicans listed on invites, or that go to events, but what they still haven’t done, and every campaign before has done, and hillary is doing, is have a concerted jewish outreach.” while the jewish vote in the u.s. is traditionally heavily democratic, there have been major efforts in recent years to convert more jewish voters to the gop. in 2012, romney surrogates like former sen. norm coleman hit the synagogue circuit for romney and billboards reading “obama…oy vey!” littered south florida roads. romney personally visited israel. and four years earlier, former sen. joe lieberman was a top surrogate for john mccain. for several election cycles, florida republicans have targeted orthodox jews, israeli-american jews and jews from south america, some of whom tend to be more conservative than their generally liberal co-religionists. and jewish republicans could claim some success in 2012: president barack obama won 69 percent of the jewish vote in 2012 — down from 78 percent in 2008. but trump, who has had to spend time swatting down accusations of racism and anti-semitism following support from bigoted backers like former ku klux klan head david duke, already has built-in challenges with the community. and his lack of campaign infrastructure and outreach doesn’t help either, some jewish political operatives say. it’s a missed opportunity, they add, especially in florida, a battleground state crucial to trump’s path to victory, where five percent of the electorate is jewish and presidential elections are routinely close. “who are their surrogates doing rallies, getting out the vote, speaking to this specific group?” spies asked. “there doesn’t seem to be an actual effort.” aaron keyak, the co-founder of the firm bluelight strategies and a former top executive at the national jewish democratic council who worked to counter republican jewish outreach in 2012, said he was surprised at the barebones effort in the u.s. this year. “’incompetence’ was never a word that came up when it came to [republican] jewish voter outreach in 2012,” he said. “you don’t even know where to start now.” this time around, coleman refuses to back trump, lieberman is supporting hillary clinton — and doing pro-israel events with moderates and republicans on her behalf — and jewish supporters and detractors of trump both agree there has been virtually no jewish-focused outreach from his campaign in florida, something the campaign itself acknowledges. “we welcome and include everybody, so i would say our approach is more general,” said susie wiles, who this month took over trump’s florida campaign, an operation that until recently had almost no field offices at all. “our approach is also more aggressive, our outreach, our voter contact is unprecedented, that includes everybody in florida.” she didn’t deny the absence of a specific jewish voter outreach plan in florida. “i would say that’s not wrong,” she said. but the lack of concerted jewish outreach effort from the campaign itself doesn’t bother some of trump’s jewish supporters in florida, who think the campaign is wise to focus on more sizable, less liberal-leaning constituencies. “those of us who are republican jews are plenty outspoken about the sell-out of israel by liberal jews, but there’s no part of us that thinks we’re going to change their minds,” said sid dinerstein, a former chair of the palm beach county gop. “there are bigger fish to fry.” the clinton campaign doesn’t see it that way. they have both a director of jewish outreach and a florida-specific jewish vote coordinator, as well as operatives in ohio and pennsylvania who focus on the jewish vote. they conduct “bubbe banking” — using the yiddish term for “grandmother” to describe programs through which jewish senior citizens call their grandchildren and urge them to vote for hillary clinton. they’re also encouraging rabbi-to-rabbi phone banking. there are jewish women for hillary events across the swing states, and weekly calls with rabbis and community leaders. the campaign has plans for more surrogates to hit swing-state synagogues, and they are highlighting centrist validators like lieberman, former new york city mayor michael bloomberg and billionaire seth klarman, a major donor to jewish causes and to republicans. that’s part of an outreach effort to moderates and republicans who care about a muscular foreign policy and strong support for israel. jews for progress, a super pac chaired by former congressman ron klein — who lives in boca raton, fla. — is also planning to advocate on clinton’s behalf in swing state jewish communities, with the goal of raising a sum in the seven figures, klein said, to fund that effort. while there are clinton volunteers in israel as part of activities run by democrats abroad, their efforts don’t appear as extensive as those from republicans overseas israel. asked whether there was a similar democratic effort, israeli operative nimrod dweck replied, “no! no. there’s no reason. three hundred thousand people, that’s like a small town.” dweck, who works on center-left issues in israel and has partnered with 270 strategies, a consulting firm whose founders played key roles on obama’s campaigns, continued, “if you want to work on your effort, go to key states in the u.s. do get-out-the-vote in the united states.”      trump's israel ground game      
__label__0 six months after hurricane katrina struck new orleans, my then girlfriend (now wife), liz, and i first arrived in st. bernard parish as volunteers. there we met a world war ii veteran named mr. andre who like many of his generation had been proud and independent his whole life, never needing assistance and certainly never asking for it if he did. though he used a walker, he insisted on holding his own food tray at the relief tent where we were working. mr. andre was a regular at the tent and after speaking with him at mealtime for three days, he finally broke down sobbing. he told us that every day for the past three months, he’d been sleeping in his pickup truck. three times a day, before each meal, he would drive to a temporary fema site to apply for aid. each time, he would be denied. mr. andre had reached his breaking point right there in front of us. mr. andre’s story is all too common after a disaster strikes. eleven years after katrina, despite tremendous progress, too many homeowners have not been able to rebuild. four years after sandy, thousands of new yorkers and new jersey citizens still have no predictable time frame for their return home. now, after the torrential flooding in south louisiana in august, more than 70,000 families — the vast majority of which, did not live in mandatory flood insurance zones and, therefore, did not have flood insurance — have just started down the arduous, painful slog that is disaster recovery in america. a delayed, unpredictable, inefficient, or otherwise prolonged recovery takes an enormous human toll. as it works now, the “traditional model” of disaster recovery in this country forces too many of our fellow citizens to stare into the abyss of uncertainty after disaster, not knowing when they’ll get home or how to navigate the myriad steps they’ll need to take to get there. during this time, retirees and seniors are robbed of their golden years as their savings are drained. for the young, fleeting formative years of childhood and adolescence are disrupted, and parents struggle to bring a sense of normalcy to their families while taking on the burden of a rent payment in addition to their mortgage payments. it doesn’t have to be this way. it shouldn’t be this way. people can be resilient to a point, but to maintain mental, physical, emotional and financial stability, they need predictability, certainty and transparency. they need hope and a clear path — one unencumbered by false starts, dead ends and unnecessary red tape. for the past 10 years, liz and i have been running sbp, a national long-term disaster recovery organization. in that time, we’ve seen firsthand how americans are hardwired to fix and solve problems, and answer the call in droves after disasters by volunteering or contributing. but we also have realized that, despite all of this generous support, there is only a certain amount of time that disaster survivors can endure, as they try to find the path home. disasters today are more frequent, inflict more damage and occur in places with no history of such disasters. according to a 2013 study, since 2007, nearly 80 percent of the u.s. population — 243 million people — live in counties that experienced at least one weather-related federally declared disaster. simply put, at a time when an efficient model is needed more than ever, disaster recovery in this country is not working as efficiently as it should or could. nearly four years after superstorm sandy, only 50 percent of homeowners who qualify for assistance through new york city’s build it back program have received it. and yet, mayor bill deblasio has stated his intention to declare victory and shutter the program at the end of the year. in new orleans, 11 years after katrina, 3,000 previously independent homeowners can’t afford to rebuild without additional help. citizens affected by the most recent flooding in west virginia and louisiana are unsure whether regional and partisan politics will prevent the allocation of federal funds. in a time of more frequent, severe and widespread disasters, the status quo in recovery cannot stand. we must not be afraid to adapt, innovate and reform our current long-term disaster recovery strategy. admittedly, to do so requires a much larger, more nuanced policy conversation, but there are three straightforward suggestions which, if implemented, would greatly help shrink the time between disaster and recovery. first, the government should enable taxpayers to pre-register for fema and small business administration disaster loans through their irs tax filing. the majority of the information required to apply for fema and sba aid following disaster is contained in annual taxpayer filings with the irs. by enabling taxpayers to pre-register with fema and the sba through their tax filings, citizens can be spared the aggravation — imagine trying to produce documentation after several feet of water has flooded your home and town hall — and delay in applying for federal disaster aid. second, congress should increase funding for americorps. national service — specifically through americorps — provides vital support and capacity to organizations that operate both in the short and long term after a disaster. besides being a vehicle for citizens to serve their country, the very existence of the post-disaster ecosystem relies upon americorps and its members. yet americorps funding is often uncertain, with lawmakers threatening to decrease or even defund the program on an annual basis. given the increased pace and severity of disasters, lawmakers should stop viewing americorps as a line item to be cut for budgetary purposes and instead boost funding for americorps and provide more opportunities for americans to serve hard-hit communities. finally, the government should implement rapid, resilient, hud-compliant housing recovery programs within the first few days after a disaster. typically, it takes at least a year for hud community development block grant funding to reach disaster affected communities. waiting a year or more results in homeowner distress, community degradation, and increased costs to the federal government due to the amplified costs of mold and secondary damage. if instead, private capital investment stood up the first year or two of the recovery with a government guarantee, and was coupled with a streamlined environmental review processes that allowed damaged or destroyed properties to be rebuilt on their original footprint without the lengthy review required of new development, communities would recover much sooner. those initial investments would then be reimbursed by hud when those funds became available. in doing so, the pace and results of the recovery will have been sustained over the course of the initial year and the federal government would stand to save significant money. the cause of more frequent disasters is not up for debate. thousand-year storms seem to be happening monthly. the effect too, is plain as day. in south louisiana last month, more than 70,000 americans lost their homes when an unnamed and unprecedented rainstorm dumped a record 30 inches of rain on the region over the course of two days. homeowners who were told they had no need for flood insurance when they purchased their home, took on eight feet of muddy water, and are now staring into the abyss. the good news is that proven, actionable solutions exist to shrink the time between disaster and recovery. now we must find the political will to fix this broken system. our fellow americans are counting on it. zack rosenburg is co-founder and ceo of sbp.      how to fix our disaster recovery strategy      
__label__0 chuck schumer is sitting on a mountain of cash. and now he’s starting to dole it out to fellow democrats who might make him majority leader. the new york senator is transferring $1 million to the senate democrats’ campaign arm on tuesday. he’s also given $3.2 million to state parties over the past week, democratic sources said. story continued below earlier this month, schumer shifted an additional $2 million from his campaign war chest to the democratic senatorial campaign committee. altogether in september, schumer has transferred $6.2 million of the $27 million he has on hand to help democratic hopefuls. republicans control 54 seats, but democrats are favored to win three back, so control of the chamber is seen as a toss-up. as the party begins making difficult decisions about where to spend and where to cut, a significant transfer from schumer could go a long way. “the kochs do not have a finite amount of money, they have unlimited money. we have a finite amount of money,” said senate minority leader harry reid (d-nev.) in an interview on monday. “we’re just trying to allocate our resources so they’re meaningful to us and our candidates.” schumer’s money could give democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in florida and ohio and eye instead cheaper races in north carolina and missouri. no one has more to gain from a democratic takeover of the senate than schumer, who will ascend to the leader job in 2017 as reid retires after a 12-year stint as party head. schumer’s donation is both a vote of confidence in his party’s candidates and a reflection of democrats’ future challenges. democrats are defending 25 seats in 2018 compared with just eight gop seats, so if democrats come up short in november they are unlikely to take back the majority this decade. schumer has also raised $2 million directly for candidates’ committees, and a joint account that he leads has collected $800,000 combined for the dscc and individual candidates. he’s planning a fall event in new york to benefit senate candidates that’s projected to bring in “upwards of another million,” according to a person close to the new york senator. “schumer has been relentless,” said a dscc official. schumer and reid have also appeared at numerous events for senate majority pac, a super pac backing democratic senate hopefuls run by former aides to reid, including his onetime chief of staff, susan mccue. the group, which can accept unlimited donations from donors, has spent more than $30 million this cycle. democrats complain that republican super pacs have far outspent them. “leader reid and senator schumer are working around the clock to raise awareness about the avalanche of money republicans are pouring into senate races through independent expenditures. the amounts are staggering,” mccue said in a statement. schumer still will have roughly $20 million on hand after the transfer. he is up for reelection in new york, with the latest polls showing him trouncing his gop challenger by more than 40 points. however, if past is prologue, schumer is likely to spend some money on it despite token opposition. schumer spent about $13 million in 2010, but that was a historically bad year for democrats. schumer’s colleagues won’t rule out the possibility that he’ll donate more to his party’s senate takeover effort. “if he thinks it will make a difference, he’ll do it. he’s very calculating,” said a democratic senator. “chuck will be there if you need him.” sen. debbie stabenow (d-mich.), a close ally of schumer, agreed that the presumptive democratic leader might provide more. “he’s going to watch everything closely. it’s my sense he’s 1,000 percent committed to taking back the senate,” stabenow said. there’s no decision yet on where the dscc might allocate the additional money from schumer. it could go toward races in new hampshire, pennsylvania or nevada, states that are all exceedingly close, or help compete in pricey florida. using the cash in red-leaning states is another option. “we’re going to make some tough decisions, which haven’t been made yet,” reid said. the national republican senatorial committee has been outraised by the dscc to the tune of $36 million. outside groups like the senate leadership fund are making up the difference, but republican officials are leaning on their rank and file to help fill the campaign coffers, with mcconnell coming up with nearly $4 million in transfers thus far. sen. john thune (r-s.d.) made a big splash with a $2 million transfer, but even though he has millions more on hand, thune said he’ll need to hang on to the rest of his cash. “i don’t think i can probably keep pace with schumer,” thune said in an interview. republicans are now trying to wring every last bit out of their members, after sen. richard shelby of alabama spurned transferring any of his $10 million. now the gop hopes that nrsc vice chairs dean heller of nevada and tom cotton of arkansas may make a last-minute transfer. they have yet to give money directly to the group, gop sources said, though they have helped raise funds directly for the nrsc. the third vice chair joni ernst of iowa gave last week, an aide said tuesday morning. republicans, however, simply don’t have their own chuck schumer. instead, they are relying on a tightening presidential race, deep-pocketed outside groups and candidates who are running far ahead of trump to eke out a win. “he’s a machine,” senate majority whip john cornyn of texas said of schumer, his workout partner. but “it may not make a difference,” the texan added.      schumer transfers millions to dems in bid for senate takeover      
__label__0 truth be told, it isn’t really about hillary anymore. her picture comes on the screen, and you are very tempted to channel surf away from it. story continued below but the donald comes on, that orange pumpkin face fills the screen, and you stop to listen to what new outrage gushes forth from his lips. it does not matter if what he says is false. that trump lies on a regular and dismal basis is no longer a question. it is a fact. for months and months, the national press corps has been tiptoeing around this. but now it has stopped clutching its pearls and has decided to call the truth the truth and a falsehood a falsehood. “trump gives up a lie, but refuses to repent,” was the front-page headline on michael barbaro’s tough-as-nails piece in the new york times on friday. the article, labeled a news analysis, was about “birtherism,” the racist lie that sought to discredit barack obama by saying he could not have been born in the united states because no african-american could honestly ascend to such a job. “it was never true, any of it,” barbaro wrote. “mr. obama’s citizenship was never in question. no credible evidence ever suggested otherwise. “yet it took mr. trump five years of dodging, winking and joking to surrender to reality, finally, on friday, after a remarkable campaign of relentless deception that tried to undermine the legitimacy of the nation’s first black president.” “he nurtured the conspiracy like a poisonous flower, watering and feeding it with an ardor that still baffles and embarrasses many around him.” but not everybody around trump is embarrassed. and his staff is paid to be baffled on a full-time basis. “we own both the momentum and enthusiasm dynamics right now,” trump campaign manager kellyanne conway said a few days ago, in the trump version of english. “everybody loves a winner, so people now see these polls tightening where we’re up, tied or within the margin of error in nearly all of the swing states,” conway said. “people are starting to see that trump can actually pull this off.” that’s right. trump is exposed as a liar and this gives him the “enthusiasm dynamics” to pull off a victory, because lies make the polls tighten and tight polls make everybody love a winner even if he lied to get his victory. poisonous flowers grow in such word salads, i guess. what was conway really saying? a translation was provided in a washington post story on sunday: “after five years of peddling lies and innuendo about the circumstances of president obama’s birth, trump on friday bowed to the facts and acknowledged for the first time that obama was born in the united states, although he refused to apologize for his efforts to delegitimize the nation’s first black president.” there it was in a news story by philip rucker and dan balz: a major party candidate had peddled lies for five years, had finally been forced to admit the truth, but was refusing to take any responsibility for his lies and their outcome. “everybody loves a winner,” conway said. on friday, trump said he was going to make a “major statement” about the whole birther mess. and he was going to make this statement from his lavish, which is to say tasteless, new hotel on pennsylvania avenue, just blocks from the white house. the press usually goes along with trump’s buffoonery, giving him virtually unlimited airtime, internet coverage and newspaper space regardless of what he has to say. this time, however, he went a little far. he managed to squeeze a lie into the nothing he had to say. “hillary clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. i finished it. i finished it, you know what i mean,” trump said. “president barack obama was born in the united states. period.” with that, trump left the stage, taking no questions and making no apologies. two days later, john dickerson had conway on “face the nation.” dickerson: donald trump advocated something for five years that was a lie. why did he do that? conway: well, you’re going to have to ask him, but again, i think this is a sideshow now. dickerson said our next president might have to send young americans off “to die in wars” and, therefore, it might be important whether the president was a truth teller or a liar. conway reacted as if dickerson was speaking martian and said the press really ought to be concentrating on trump’s new child care plan. (though she did not say if trump was telling the truth about his new child care plan.) on saturday, president obama addressed the annual congressional black caucus foundation dinner. “now, there’s an extra spring in my step,” he said with a broad smile. “i don’t know about you guys, but i am so relieved that the birther thing is over.” “i mean, [isis], north korea, poverty, climate change — none of those things weighed on my mind like the validity of my birth certificate!” he said as the audience laughed. truth and falsity are important, but so is balance. having just quoted a democrat, i’ll end with the words of a republican, abraham lincoln: “no man has a good enough memory to be a successful liar.” which may be why trump will fail in the end: he simply won’t be able to keep track of all his lies. roger simon is politico's chief political columnist.      if you can't remember all your lies, you're telling too many

brooklyn -- how robby mook says clinton can win -- by gabe debenedetti in new york: “‘here’s the story that no poll can tell: hillary clinton has many paths to 270 electoral votes, while donald trump has very few. hillary is nearly certain to win 16 ‘ blue' states, including washington d.c., which will garner her 191 electoral votes,” writes mook in the nearly 2,000-word memo that was blasted out [to donors, supporters and volunteers] in the early evening, and which was obtained by politico. ‘if we add the five states that fivethirtyeight.com gives hillary a 70% or greater chance of winning (michigan, minnesota, pennsylvania, virginia, and wisconsin), hillary only needs 10 more electoral votes.’ ... “‘put a different way, of these battleground states, hillary can win just one (florida, ohio, or north carolina) and win the presidency, which means the six additional states would only add more electoral votes to her total,” he writes. “donald trump, on the other hand, must win six of these seven states, including florida, north carolina, and ohio — none of which he can lose.’” http://politi.co/2cjjfvc adelson ponies up -- “adelson to spend at least $45 million on 2016 races in

senate majority leader mitch mcconnell. a check of a similar size is expected to go to the congressional leadership fund, a similar super pac focused on the house of representatives. and to back

white house race between clinton and donald trump, a sign in and of itself of his distaste for the gop nominee. but his preference for the wife of his own successor, president bill clinton, nonetheless became known to a wider audience thanks to kathleen hartington kennedy townsend, the former maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late robert f. kennedy. in a telephone interview, townsend said she met with the former president in maine earlier today, where she said he made his preference known that he was voting for a democrat. ‘that’s what he said,’ she told politico. “asked about townsend’s [facebook] post, george h.w. bush spokesman jim mcgrath in an email replied, ‘the vote president bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just

__label__0 george soros is pumping $500 million into migrant- and refugee-founded businesses and other initiatives, the billionaire investor announced tuesday, noting that his hope is other investors will follow suit. “our collective failure to develop and implement effective policies to handle the increased flow has contributed greatly to human misery and political instability—both in countries people are fleeing and in the countries that host them, willingly or not,” soros wrote in a wall street journal op-ed published online tuesday. “migrants are often forced into lives of idle despair, while host countries fail to reap the proven benefit that greater integration could bring.” story continued below while acknowledging that governments should play a key role “by creating and sustaining adequate physical and social infrastructure,” soros pointed to “power of the private sector” as a critical need, too. in response to the obama administration’s recently announced call to action for u.s. companies to play a larger role in the refugee crisis, soros wrote, “i have decided to earmark $500 million for investments that specifically address the needs of migrants, refugees and host communities.” “i will invest in startups, established companies, social-impact initiatives and businesses founded by migrants and refugees themselves,” he continued. “although my main concern is to help migrants and refugees arriving in europe, i will be looking for good investment ideas that will benefit migrants all over the world.” soros said his nonprofit-owned investments will complement his foundation’s philanthropic contributions and cover various sectors, including emerging digital technology. it “seems especially promising as a way to provide solutions to the particular problems that dislocated people often face,” he said. “advances in this sector can help people gain access more efficiently to government, legal, financial and health services. private businesses are already investing billions of dollars to develop such services for non-migrant communities.” investments, he added, “are intended to be successful—because i want to show how private capital can play a constructive role helping migrants.” adding that he plans to work with organizations like the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees and the international rescue committee to create principles that will guide his investments, soros said his goal “is to harness, for public good, the innovations that only the private sector can provide. i hope my commitment will inspire other investors to pursue the same mission.”      george soros to give $500 million to migrant, refugee businesses

coin shop, and as i idled over some of the display cases, i noticed a set of coins from the mid-19th century. oddly, the coins from the 1840s and 1850s were large—up until 1857, when the coins started becoming, at best, half the size of the others. “oh, the panic of 1857,” the owner said when i asked him about the change of size. “it was really bad. the president didn’t seem to have any solution except to use less gold or silver in the coins.” story continued below now that is inept presidential decision-making. during the current election campaign, there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth over the possibility that—whoever the winner is—he or she will be so terrible as a leader they will bring down the republic as the worst president since independence. and before the current candidates were known, the two most recent white house occupants, barack obama and george w. bush, have been consistently reviled by their detractors as the worst men to lead the country. but obama and bush can both take heart. and donald trump and hillary clinton can gain solace, perhaps, from knowing that no matter how badly they do, they almost certainly won’t rank last. by my reckoning, that place belongs to james buchanan, genial a man though he was. i’ve made quite a study of him. my innocent encounter at the coin shop only reinforced my lifelong determination to take an offbeat look at, let’s say, the lesser presidents. my father was definitely the only one in our suburban neighborhood with a biography of franklin pierce. everywhere we went, he forced me to read historical plaques—stopping the car in a shrieking halt at times to view them. if i were to write a book about a president, it surely wouldn’t be about washington or lincoln, or even silent cal coolidge. it would have to be about someone as ineffectual as possible. buchanan, the only president from my native state, pennsylvania, turned out to be my man. start with his anemic, minimalist solution to one of america’s great financial downturns. for a long time before buchanan, in effect, precipitated the panic of 1857, things were going well for the country, at least in an economic sense. there had been a bad downturn 20 years before, with multiple causes, like war in europe, the dissolution of the bank of the united states, and overspeculation in, oddly enough, slaves and western land. the great acquisition of land under president james knox polk, from oregon to california to texas, reinvigorated the economy, and a boom lasted for the next two decades. railroads were the big player, since so many people wanted to move west into the new territories and states. manufacturing boomed domestically, and then with foreign trade as well, since europe had quelled many of its hostilities and american items were cheaper than those on the continent. then the day before buchanan took office, congress passed what he wanted, the tariff bill of 1857, which lowered tariffs on a panoply of items from abroad—buchanan wanted to stimulate foreign trade—but made american manufactured goods of the same sort less competitive. three days later came the real fatal blow, though, the dred scott supreme court decision, which fell on the shoulders of buchanan. the case had wound through state and federal courts for at least a decade, but roger taney, the supreme court chief justice, and a fellow alumnus, with buchanan, of small dickinson college, wanted it settled. scott was a slave to a military man who at times was stationed not in his native missouri, a slave state, but in the northwest territories, which were nonslave. after his master died, scott brought the case that he should be free because he had lived in nonslave territory. buchanan wanted to be a hero, and thought if the case could be decided broadly, it could settle the question of slavery in the union for good. buchanan knew, too, though, that the court had five southerners and four northerners, and if the decision were split that way, it would be ineffective. he and taney had apparently agreed to have a narrower decision, or remand the case back to the appeals court, if it were merely sectional, since they felt the need to have some sort of bipartisanship for the decision to be legitimate. ignoring the idea of separation of powers, though, buchanan browbeat robert cooper grier, another dickinson alumnus and a justice from pennsylvania, to go along with the majority opinion, which taney would write. eventually, a new york native, justice samuel nelson, wrote a concurring opinion, making the vote even less sectional. legend has it that taney, on the capitol stairs just before he gave buchanan the oath of office at the inauguration, told buchanan that the decision would become public in the next few days. buchanan apparently changed his speech to indicate that—and that he would be all for whatever the court decided. two days later, the decision came down. taney castigated scott, whom he said was not a citizen, being a slave, and thus could not bring any suit. he also wrote that the constitution gave no state or territory the power to institute or, conversely, prohibit slavery. thus all the compromises about it, going back to the 1820s, were invalid, and, in fact, the fugitive slave law, requiring anyone who knew about it to return slaves to their owners anywhere in the country, was in force. historically, experts rate dred scott as the worst decision in the court’s history, but short of that, it was at the very least transformational for the country—with not just taney, but surely buchanan, responsible for it. as appalled as most of the country was about the morals of the decision at the time, there was a practical downside, too. now no one knew whether he or she wanted to go west, to use the railroads, or to start a business that railroads might profit from. railroad stocks started to decline in value, and then a contagion hit, and it was free fall. by midsummer, no one could take a ride on the reading, as uncle pennybags does in the monopoly game, since the reading railroad had shut down, as did lines now and then famous like the illinois central. several lines, like the delaware, lackawanna and western and the fond du lac railroad in wisconsin, declared bankruptcy. thousands were thrown out of work, and banks started foreclosing on loans and property. senator william seward, the leader of the new republican party, come home from a vacation to find out he had lost most everything he owned—his stock in the illinois central, promoted to him by his rival democrat stephen douglas, was virtually worthless. every bank in new york city effectively closed—none would convert coins or gold into bank notes. the oldest grain company in new york, n.h. wolfe and co., failed in august, as did the most prominent insurance business in the country, the ohio life insurance and trust co. buchanan and his administration did nothing to stem the public hysteria. calm words might have quelled it, but his inaction only made for further runs on banks and, thus, more turmoil in markets. the residue that mattered most, though, was the reaction caused by dred scott. instead of promoting unity and opening up the west to more settlement, as buchanan had thought, dred scott thwarted it, and brought an end to years of northern prosperity. yet the south did not succumb as badly. its agrarian culture was self-sustaining, and its cotton still had a market in europe. there was a surge in arms sales there as well, the economic downturn in the north exacerbating regional tensions. the relative good times in the south caused northerners of all parties to further blame buchanan for being a southern lackey. buchanan’s response was underwhelming, almost disdainful. he said the federal government could do nothing. in his annual message in december 1857, he said he sympathized with the travails caused by the panic, but he would do nothing for individual suffering. the government would continue to pay its obligations and would keep going on whatever public works projects it had started, but would begin no new ones. he said too many people had speculated in land and slaves and the like and “deserved the gambler’s fate.” eventually, he noted, the youth and energy of the rugged american individuals would triumph, though there would clearly be an interim of rough times. in a sense, he was right, because it took the rugged young americans who went to war in 1861 to bring the economy back. throughout his term, when a fork appeared in the road, buchanan managed to take the wrong turn. when hostilities flared in kansas, over whether that territory would enter as a slave or free state, buchanan wavered over which of two proposed constitutions would be valid, exacerbating the killings, some done by the wild-eyed anti-slavery radical john brown. when later brown seized arms with a small cadre of followers in harpers ferry, west virginia, just 40 miles from washington along the potomac, buchanan again diddled before consulting robert e. lee, who had fortuitously been home in arlington on leave from his post in texas. lee quickly went to harpers ferry to capture brown and quell the raid. in other ventures, though, buchanan dashed troops out on strange and unproductive missions. he caused chaos in utah, quelling what he thought to be a mormon revolt, causing villages to be burned to the ground and dozens of lives lost over what was merely a jurisdictional dispute. he supported mercenary william walker’s forays to conquer nicaragua and guatemala, and sent troops to try to annex parts of paraguay, primarily to acquiesce to his southern base that wanted more slave states to come into the union. then there was the little known pig war, started when a settler along the canadian border on the san juan straits in the northwest, shot a pig owned by the hudson bay co. that wandered onto his property. a standoff ensued until buchanan sent troops otherwise guarding kansas, where there was a real problem, out to calm the nonfatal—except to one pig—battle. this was at a time when there were about only 12,000 soldiers in the u.s. army, stretched as thin as could be. as the election of 1860 came close, buchanan refused to support the one democrat who could win, stephen douglas, because he just plain didn’t like him. that caused the party to split into three factions, each nominating a candidate, virtually ensuring republican abraham lincoln the election. the southern states, which had threatened secession, started doing so during the interim between lincoln’s election and his inauguration in march, thus under buchanan’s watch. buchanan took the unusual position that the constitution did not allow secession, but the president could not do anything to prevent it. as the first half-dozen states seceded, buchanan lost several cabinet members—he had a lot of southern allies—and refused entreaties by many, including former president john tyler, who would himself become a confederate congressman, to find compromises to bring the wastrel states back into the fold. meanwhile, buchanan allowed the seizure of armaments and forts by the seceding states and suggested the abandonment of the one major fortified island in the south, fort sumter. enter lincoln, who has long been rated in serious surveys and schoolmarms’ speeches as the greatest of presidents. lincoln no doubt was a man with plans and savvy, but i contend that the bar was set so low by his predecessor that maybe if there were no james buchanan, the “worst. president. ever,” there would have been a few notches more on the presidential-rating scale for abe lincoln to climb. today, george w. bush is often rated one of the worst presidents in history, thanks to his authorship of the iraq war and his presiding over the crash of ’08 and the beginning of the great recession. obama is sometimes seen in the same light, especially by the far right. but as happened with honest abe and his predecessor, perhaps that low bar will only make it easier for a president hillary clinton or a president donald trump to shine.      worst. president. ever.      
__label__0 albany — while donald trump and his supporters have recently expressed optimism the republican presidential nominee can carry new york in november, he still has a lot of ground to make up for that to happen. a poll conducted by the siena college research institute last week found democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton leading trump 51 percent to 30 percent in new york with third-party candidates included, a modest change from the 50 percent to 25 lead she enjoyed in august. story continued below while the two most recent siena polls aren’t perfectly comparable — last month’s looked at registered voters, while the one released tuesday deals with likely voters — there were some demographic groups among which trump showed improvement. in particular, voters in new york city’s suburbs seem to have warmed to him. clinton led there, 42 percent to 31 percent in august; the gap has since narrowed to 39 percent to 38 percent. trump also appears to be doing slightly better among young voters (those between 18 and 34 years old backed clinton 51 percent to 18 in august; now they back her 53 percent to 27 percent) and jewish voters (clinton’s lead slid from 51 percent to 25 percent in august to 45 percent to 31 percent this month). but trump’s support plummeted among low-income earners. in august, people earning less than $50,000 a year backed clinton 46 percent to 29; her lead among that group now stands at 64 percent to 23 percent, the poll found. additionally, clinton’s lead among african americans increased from 79 percent to 5 percent last month to 85 percent to 1 percent in the latest poll. trump is now running fourth among the state’s black electorate, with his 1percent falling short of libertarian gary johnson’s 4 percent and the green party’s jill stein’s 3 percent. the new poll also found that u.s. sen. charles schumer’s lead over republican challenger wendy long has grown from 63 percent to 24 percent in august to 69 percent to 23 percent this month. if undecided voters break the same way as those who have already made up their minds, schumer is on pace to received 75 percent of the vote in november, passing the modern record of 72.2 percent sen. kirsten gillibrand received when she defeated long in 2012. in other findings, gov. andrew cuomo’s favorability stands at 57 percent, up slightly from the 53 percent favorability rating he enjoyed in august. but voters said they “prefer someone else” to cuomo in the 2018 gubernatorial race by a margin of 49 percent to 45 percent, up slightly from 47 percent to 46 percent last month. the siena poll has a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points. siena predicts that this year’s electorate will be 50 percent democratic, 25 percent republican, and 21 percent “independent/ other.” view the poll’s crosstabs here: http://bit.ly/2cxg8e0      new york new siena poll finds clinton, schumer with big leads in new york      
__label__0 donald trump called for a change tuesday in how the u.s. handles the terror threat of the islamic state, a shift away from president barack obama and hillary clinton's policies. “crooked hillary has been fighting isis, or whatever she has been doing, for years,” trump tweeted tuesday morning. “now she has new ideas. it is time for change.” story continued below following a series of planted bombs in new york and new jersey over the weekend and a stabbing in minnesota, trump on monday hammered clinton on her record amid increasing concerns regarding the terrorist network and the threat of domestic attacks. the real estate mogul again blamed clinton and obama for refusing to utter the words “radical islamic terrorism” and accused them of emboldening terrorists across the globe. “today, hillary clinton showed again that she will say anything — and blame anyone — to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as secretary of state,” he said in a statement monday, adding that terrorists are “hoping and praying that hillary clinton becomes president so that they can continue their savagery and murder.” trump vowed to “bring an end to these senseless acts of violence” and condemned the white house, whose spokesman referred to the battle against the islamic state as a “narrative fight.” “they are wrong to say that we’re in a fight about ‘narratives,’” trump said. “these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life.”      trump hits clinton on islamic state: ‘it is time for change’      
__label__0 donald trump is the antithesis of the united states, according to u2 frontman bono, who called the republican presidential nominee “potentially the worst idea that ever happened to america.” “look, america is like the best idea the world ever came up with,” bono, whose real name is paul david hewson, told “cbs this morning” in an interview broadcast tuesday. “but donald trump is potentially the worst idea that ever happened to america. potentially.” story continued below bono pointed to nations like ireland and great britain as great countries but suggested that america is different because it’s an idea, one that trump is “trying to hijack.” “that idea is bound up in justice and equality for all — equality and justice for all, you know,” he continued. “i think he’s hijacked the party. i think he’s trying to hijack the idea of america. and i think it’s bigger than all of us. i think it’s — it’s — this is really dangerous.”      bono: ‘trump is potentially the worst idea that ever happened to america’      
__label__0 jack welch may have to think twice about backing ted cruz again, but there’s no doubt in his mind which presidential candidate he’s voting for in november: donald trump. casting the republican presidential nominee as the candidate who can strengthen the economy, create jobs, peel back regulations and be tough on terrorism and immigration, the former general electric ceo on tuesday outlined why he is backing trump. story continued below “basically, i want a strong economy that creates jobs,” welch told cnbc’s “squawk box.” “this is a binary choice. you either take the republican agenda or you take the democratic agenda,” he continued. “the democratic agenda is obama-plus stated over and over again.” regulations are also “choking” american businesses, welch said, adding that president barack obama plans to increase regulations in the final months of his presidency. he also conceded that trump, as president, may have to negotiate with congress, meaning his proposals could get watered down before they’re enacted. “well, it will be a negotiation with congress. but this is his position and i like his position, and he’ll have to negotiate with congress because congress might not wanna reform epa as much as he does and that’ll be a negotiation,” welch said. “ok, that’s a fact of life. i like him negotiating from these positions a lot more than i like the democratic candidate negotiating because she’s negotiating from obama-plus, ok? it truly is. we might not get all this, but i like starting here and fighting like hell for it because i know it’ll grow the economy 4 percent-plus.” welch last week told fox news’ neil cavuto that he would have second thoughts about backing cruz again, noting that he didn’t like the fact that the texas senator hasn’t honored his pledge to support trump as the nominee. he added that he would be casting his vote for trump because america can’t afford eight more years of democrats charting the nation’s economic course.      jack welch outlines why he's supporting trump      
__label__0 accused of a “pay to play” scheme with donald trump, a defiant florida attorney general pam bondi broke her silence with the state’s news media tuesday to say that she had no regrets in accepting a $25,000 political contribution from the republican at the same time her office said it was examining fraud allegations against trump university that it ultimately didn’t pursue. “donald trump did not get a pass,” bondi told reporters. story continued below bondi told reporters that the contribution, made to her political committee amid her 2014 reelection campaign, had no bearing on her office’s decision to not join a civil fraud lawsuit filed by new york attorney general eric schneiderman against trump university, which was defunct by the time she first took office in 2011. “there never was an investigation into donald trump by this office,” bondi said. bondi’s first political opponent in 2010, former state senator and federal prosecutor dan gelber, recently said she should at least have returned the check to trump while the new york case was pending. but bondi on tuesday said she didn’t return the check because it would have looked as if it were a bribe. “if i had returned it you would have reported ‘bondi accepted a bribe, got caught and returned it.’ that's how the reporting goes,” bondi said. “and so, no, there was nothing improper about it. so there was no reason to return it.” nonetheless, when controversy recently flared over the donation again, bondi’s committee tried to return the check but trump wouldn’t accept it. scores of complaints against trump university and he related trump institute were filed during the term of her predecessor, bill mccollum, who did not investigate. at the time she collected the contribution, only one additional complaint against trump university had been filed with her office and, bondi said, she was unaware of the complaint when she solicited the contribution from trump. the attorney general’s office fields tens of thousands of complaints yearly. still, the timing of bondi’s solicitation and acceptance of the check from trump in 2013 have made the two republicans an easy target for democrats who have filed ethics complaints, accused her of participating in a “pay to play” scheme and called for independent investigations. trump once said that he gives money to politicians "because when i want something, i get it. when i call, they kiss my ass.” but trump said he never discussed trump university with bondi and backed her because she’s a friend. as for why her office didn’t take the case, bondi said her office referred florida-based complainants – many of whom were elderly people who claimed they were scammed out of tens of thousands of dollars – to new york because trump university was based in that state. bondi has bristled at the negative press coverage and said that it’s wrong to question her pro-consumer record. “we have returned billions of dollars to consumers since i have been in office,” she said. bondi has been dogged by the timing of the trump donation and her office’s inaction since her 2014 reelection campaign – only to see the issue roar back to life when she endorsed trump in florida the day before the march 15 republican presidential primary that he handily won. the issue died down until last month, when trump began calling out democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton by accusing her of using the clinton foundation as a pay-to-play scheme. democrats hit back by pointing fingers at bondi. "my charity helps people, his is used to pay off your attorney general," bill clinton said at a florida event earlier this month. trump’s charity, the donald j. trump foundation, was ensnared in the trump university controversy because it was used to donate the $25,000 check to bondi’s committee. that broke irs rules and trump recently admitted to the washington post that he paid a fine over the error. the timing of the contribution was controversial from the start. on aug. 24, schneiderman announced his lawsuit against trump university. five days later, an orlando sentinel reporter called bondi’s office to inquire about whether she would join the suit. “we are currently reviewing the allegations in the new york complaint,” a bondi spokeswoman told the reporter. about this time – bondi is unclear as to the details – she solicited the check from trump. though her upper-level staff discussed the schneiderman complaint, she said she was unaware of it. on sept. 14, the orlando sentinel reported the trump university lawsuit and, the following day, bondi began receiving regular updates about the new york-based case. on sept. 17, bondi's political committee and justice for all deposited the trump check. the contribution was spotted by orlando sentinel columnist scott maxwell on oct. 15, who said the timing “looks awfully fishy.” but bondi described the contribution, among the largest to her committee, as relatively routine. “i was calling friends and family and many, many people because i was running for reelection,” bondi said.      florida ‘trump did not get a pass,’ defiant bondi says of fraud case

__label__0 reporters following the donald trump campaign as part of his pool will no longer travel in the candidate's motorcade, reversing part of a move made last week that was meant to improve press logistics. according to an email sent by organizers of the trump press pool, the campaign said it was the secret service's decision to remove the press pool from the motorcade as their resources are being stretched too thin amid a "heightened state of security" to keep the press' plane clean. "we have communicated that this is an issue that the campaign should have spotted long ago and are vigorously protesting the decision," an email from the pool chairs said. "we have told the campaign that if they are truly committed to transparency, than [sic] they should place the pool on trump's plane so it is a truly protective pool. they have not been responsive to that request." on monday, the journalists following trump began to fly on a new "chase" plane which would more closely follow trump's plane, and were told they would now travel within the trump motorcade. the move, which the campaign said was in the works for weeks, was expected to help prevent instances such as last week, when trump's press pool, caught in traffic on the way from a different airport, was late to a trump rally in new hampshire. instead of delaying his rally, trump mocked the press for being late. by not being in the motorcade, the pool will have to contend with normal traffic, making it more likely that they could miss or be late to other events. the trump press pool has been lobbying to travel with trump on his plane, a move which would solve these logistical problems, and one his campaign has signaled will likely never happen. nearly all previous presidential candidates, including hillary clinton, have their traveling press corps with them on their planes by this point in the campaign. the reversal is the latest in a series of events that has seriously frustrated the reporters who cover trump. from the campaign blacklisting certain outlets, to the candidate himself calling out certain reporters he feels are unfair (nbc's katy tur was once escorted out of a rally by secret service for her own protection after trump called her out), the reporters following trump have had to deal with a seemingly never-ending series of roadblocks. one of the few positives of trump's relationship with the media had been that despite the blacklists, he still held many news conferences and gaggles and managed to sit for interviews with a wide range of outlets at any time of day or night. now those interviews and news conferences have been drastically reduced. trump has over the past two months mostly stuck to appearances on fox news, and hasn't held a formal news conference where he takes questions in more than 54 days (he held a small gaggle with reporters on his plane a couple weeks ago). in an ironic contrast, clinton, who famously went months without a formal news conference has now held several in the past couple of weeks. secret service spokeswoman catherine milhoan declined to specify whether it was the campaign or the secret service's decision to keep the pool from the motorcade. "historically, the secret service has not provided resources to maintain the security of a secondary aircraft used for the domestic transport of press," milhoan said.

__label__0 hillary clinton on tuesday said she is “appalled” that donald trump has not apologized to president barack obama after spending years questioning his birthplace. “everything that i believe in, i want to bring to the white house. i wanna build on the progress that president obama has made during a very tumultuous time,” clinton told host steve harvey on the radio program “the steve harvey morning show.” “i mean, i’m appalled that donald trump will not apologize to the president and to the country for spending years questioning his citizenship and attempting to delegitimize him. and president obama and michelle obama, they’ve kept their heads high. like michelle says, when they go low, we go high. and we gotta stay high. we’ve gotta stay focused.” story continued below trump on friday made a much-hyped announcement regarding the conspiracy theory the now-republican presidential nominee began pushing years ago. his statement, however, lacked an apology and falsely pinned the blame on clinton for igniting the so-called “birther” issue. “hillary clinton started the ‘birther’ controversy,” trump said, though fact-checkers have found no connection between the conspiracy theory and clinton or her presidential campaign. “i finished it. barack obama was born in the united states, period. now we all want to get back to making the united states great again.” clinton was itching to hammer trump during the interview, which began with a remark about the importance of voter registration and the threat of a trump presidency before transitioning into light topics like what clinton's and harvey's grandchildren should call them (clinton laughed at harvey’s pitch for what his grandkids should call him — “big pimpin’” — and said her granddaughter calls her “grandma” and former president bill clinton “pop-pop”). “oh my gosh, can i have the whole hour?” clinton said when asked what separates her from trump. “i think it really comes down to our visions and our values. you know, i have a vision where we continue to pursue equality and justice and opportunity for everybody.”      clinton: i'm 'appalled' trump hasn't apologized to obama for birther conspiracy      
__label__0 making his case against nationalistic and anti-immigration movements that have grown both in the u.s. and around the globe, president barack obama told the united nations general assembly tuesday that “today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself.” obama’s remark appeared to be an allusion to republican presidential candidate donald trump, who has campaigned hard against the president’s record and has pledged to build a wall along america’s southern border with mexico. in his final address as president before the united nations general assembly, obama was critical of the isolationist movement that trump has championed in the u.s. and others have pushed abroad. story continued below “as these real problems have been neglected, alternative visions of the world have pressed forward, both in the wealthiest countries and in the poorest,” obama said after discussing economic inequality and other international issues. “religious fundamentalism, the politics of ethnicity or tribe or sect, aggressive nationalism, a crude populism, sometimes from the far left but more often from the far right, which seeks to restore what they believe was a better, simpler age free of outside contamination. we cannot dismiss these visions. they are powerful. they reflect dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens. ” “today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself,” the president continued. “so the answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration. instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared.” the president led his speech with a celebration of global accomplishments to which the u.s. has been party during his administration, listing the reduction of terrorists’ safe havens, the landmark nuclear agreement with iran and the resumption of diplomatic relations with cuba as successes. but obama also listed global problems like the flow of refugees, continued financial disruptions, and a lack of basic order and security in the middle east. the president urged the international community “that we must go forwards and not backwards,” offering a defense of western values as the best path forward for global growth and success. “i believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open markets and accountable governance, of democracy and human rights and international law that we have forged remain the firmest foundation for human progress in this century,” obama said. “i make this argument not based on theory or ideology but on facts.” in making that case, obama warned against strongman governments and oppressive tactics like media suppression. he said such strategies are stifling for economies hungry for information and ultimately lead to further crackdowns or the scapegoating of foreign enemies that can lead to war. speaking specifically of the middle east, obama called for the recognition of a “common humanity” that would serve as a stepping stone toward resolving the various conflicts in the region. again attacking isolationism, obama said the rest of the world cannot turn its back on conflict in the middle east in the hope that violence will be contained to the region. “until basic questions are answered about how communities coexist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn, countless human beings will suffer, most of all in that region, but extremism will continue to be exported overseas,” he said. “and the world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent it from affecting our own societies.”      obama warns against strongman governments      
__label__0 john boehner has his first private-sector job in roughly a quarter century. the former speaker of the house is joining squire patton boggs, the multinational law firm, as a strategic adviser based in washington and cincinnati. story continued below the firm has a healthy lobbying practice, but boehner will not become a lobbyist, according to the firm. he will "serve as a strategic advisor to clients in the u.s. and abroad, and will focus on global business development." boehner's post-congress livelihood is starting to take fuller shape. last week, the tobacco giant reynolds america announced he's joining its board of directors, a job that is likely to bring him north of $400,000 a year. boehner will have plenty of friends and allies at squire patton boggs, including former senate majority leader trent lott (r-miss.), former rep. jack kingston (r-ga.), and former sen. john breaux (d-la.). boehner's former top aide, david schnittger, is a senior policy adviser at squire patton boggs, as is natasha hammond, who worked for boehner for nine years. john criscuolo and amy lozupone, both boehner aides, will join him at the firm. squire patton boggs has deep ties to boehner's home state of ohio. ceo mark reuhlmann's father, gene, was the mayor of cincinnati, and squire sanders, one of the firms that predated squire patton boggs, was founded in cleveland. “with speaker boehner joining our team, we're better positioned than ever to grow our brand throughout the world and to fully capitalize on our integrated global platform," mark ruehlmann said in a news release. **subscribe to politico playbook: http://politi.co/1m75ubx      boehner joining squire patton boggs      
__label__0 seeking to shake up a tight presidential race, sen. harry reid declared tuesday on the senate floor that donald trump is a “swindler” who is “not as rich as he would have us believe" — as the nevada democrat moved to reprise the 2012 strategy that saw him hammer mitt romney repeatedly over his tax returns. several times on tuesday, the senate minority leader called out trump for declining to release his tax returns, suggesting that it’s because those documents would show that trump has far less wealth than he’s claimed. trump has said his net worth is $10 billion. story continued below “he was born with an inheritance but lost his daddy’s wealth. … that’s why donald trump won’t release his tax returns. that’s certainly one of the reasons, of course: he is not worth nearly as much as he claims to be. that’s a secret he doesn’t want anyone to know,” reid said in a scathing speech. “he wants everyone to think he’s this big, rich, rich man.” with just a handful of congressional days in session before the election, reid is unleashing increasingly heated attacks on trump and senate republicans supporting him. last week, he called trump a “human leech” and suggested the business mogul is overweight, dropping the kinds of political bombs that most pro-hillary clinton democrats wouldn’t touch. for reid, there’s less downside than for almost all other high-profile democratic surrogates: he’s retiring in september and is looking to make as much of a mark on the race as he can. in a sit-down interview on monday, he emphasized that trump cannot sustain a charge in the polls that now has him closer than ever to catching clinton, declaring that “american polling is such a joke.” “i’ve always been a pessimist; that’s just my nature,” reid said in his office. “despite my base pessimism, i’m convinced that this election is turning. what trump has done in the last couple weeks, you can’t overcome that. you can’t do it.” while reid has previously lit into trump for his business dealings, his comments about income taxes on tuesday are reminiscent of reid’s efforts to paint romney as a tax dodger in 2012, when reid repeatedly came to the floor to declare that romney did not pay any income taxes. although his claims were ultimately unproven, reid has never shown any remorse for his attacks on romney, and in fact on tuesday showed that he believes the tactics are effective enough to use again on trump. quoting trump, reid said that the gop presidential nominee’s personal wealth fluctuates with the financial markets — which reid said is cover for a man he said would be “scammer in chief.” “simply put, trump is faking his net worth because he doesn’t want us to know that he’s not a good businessman,” reid said. “since 2008, trump has not donated a single penny to his own charity … does he have money to donate? he says he does, but he doesn’t.” the trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. and republicans aren’t exactly rushing to shield trump from reid’s attacks; many, in fact, have said that trump should release his tax returns in accordance with presidential tradition. “i’m not going to comment about the presidential race or what our nominee should or should not do,” senate majority whip john cornyn (r-texas) said tuesday morning. last week, trump responded to reid’s months-long string of attacks on him from the senate floor, telling the washington post that reid should “start working out again with his rubber workout pieces,” a reference to the devastating eye injury reid sustained while exercising in 2015. reid then went on a parade of media hits to strike back at trump last week. in the interview on monday, reid said that because of his injury and his use of a cane, he is “pretty sensitive” to trump’s mockery of new york times reporter serge kovaleski, who has a disability. “he denigrates people who are handicapped. he says that he thinks i should go out and do some more exercise, suggesting that i should blind myself in my other eye,” reid said. “i don’t think that’s really so good.”      reid accuses trump of overstating wealth      
__label__0 hillary clinton is a copycat who’s probably sleeping because she needs to rest, donald trump suggested tuesday. in a pair of tweets bookended by a post announcing “two big rallies” in north carolina, trump accused the democratic presidential nominee of “copying my airplane” and continued his assault over her stamina, or alleged lack thereof. story continued below “do people notice hillary is copying my airplane rallies — she puts the plane behind her like i have been doing from the beginning,” trump mused in a tweet tuesday morning. “hillary clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest,” he added minutes later. “sleep well hillary — see you at the debate!” trump’s critical comments come shortly after clinton warned voters during a radio interview with steve harvey, “the next 50 days will determine the next 50 years.” clinton also previewed what she expects from trump in monday's presidential debate in new york, telling harvey she will do her “very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as i can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we’ve seen coming from my opponent.” “you know, i can take it, steve. i can take that kind of stuff,” she added. “i’ve been at this and, you know, i understand it’s a contact sport.” trump also attacked clinton earlier tuesday, questioning her effectiveness against the islamic state as head of the state department. “crooked hillary has been fighting isis, or whatever she has been doing, for years,” he said. “now she has new ideas. it is time for change.” clinton has no public events planned for tuesday and has opted to stay at home in chappaqua, new york, as she prepares for the debate with trump. she had a full campaign schedule on monday — between holding a news conference in white plains, new york, a campaign speech and a fundraiser in philadelphia, and three meetings with foreign leaders in new york city. she is scheduled to return to florida for a campaign rally and fundraiser on wednesday. gabriel debenedetti contributed to this report.      trump needles clinton: ‘sleep well hillary — see you at the debate!’      
__label__0 hillary clinton on tuesday warned that the nearly 50-day sprint to election day will impact far more than just the next four or eight years. making an appeal to black voters during an interview on the “steve harvey morning show,” clinton stressed that voters can’t sit this one out. story continued below “every issue they care about is at stake in this election,” clinton said. “this is not: ‘oh, you know, a little here, a little there. we can — you know, we can take it, no matter who wins.’ no. the next 50 days will determine the next 50 years, and i say that absolutely seriously.” the former secretary of state said she hopes everyone is registered to vote and directed listeners to a website to find out whether they’re registered “because i need you.” “we gotta stand up and be counted in this election,” she added. clinton’s comments come after president barack obama made an appeal on clinton's and his own behalf in an address to the congressional black caucus foundation on saturday. “my name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,” obama said. “tolerance is on the ballot. democracy is on the ballot. justice is on the ballot. good schools are on the ballot. ending mass incarceration, that’s on the ballot right now.” but up next on the docket is the first presidential debate between clinton and trump on monday in new york, where the former senator expects to absorb a bunch of body blows from an aggressive foe. “i am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as i can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we’ve seen coming from my opponent,” she said. “you know, i can take it, steve. i can take that kind of stuff. i’ve been at this and, you know, i understand it’s a contact sport.” what clinton won’t take, though, is any insults toward anyone else. “you know, his attacks on african-americans and immigrants and muslims and women and people with disabilities, it’s just — it’s just something we cannot tolerate,” she said. as clinton wrapped up her interview, trump taunted her on twitter: “hillary clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. sleep well hillary — see you at the debate!”      clinton: ‘the next 50 days will determine the next 50 years’

an intensified anti-crime and anti-drug campaign.” in a statement, they said: “meps urge the philippines government to put an end to the current wave of extrajudicial executions and killings, launch an immediate investigation into them and adopt specific, comprehensive policies and programs in full compliance with national and international obligations and respect for human rights.” duterte’s response was brief. “i read the condemnation of the eu against me. i will tell them, ‘f–k you.’ you’re doing it in atonement for your sins,” he told local government officials in davao city, media in

__label__0 gov. chris christie has the third-worst approval ratings of any governor in the country, according to a poll released tuesday. according to morning consult, new jersey voters give christie a 29 percent approval rating and 68 percent disapproval rating. that's down from a 36 percent approval rating in the spring, and not far behind the two worst ranked governors. story continued below republican sam brownback of kansas fares the worst, with a 23 percent approval rating and 71 percent disapproval rating. democrat dan malloy of connecticut has a 26 percent approval rating and a 70 percent disapproval rating. the numbers in the morning consult poll are actually slightly better for christie than a rutgers-eagleton poll released monday, which showed 26 percent of voters approving of his job performance and 69 percent disapproving, while just 23 percent said they had a favorable opinion of the governor. both surveys were conducted before the bridgegate trial got underway on monday — a spectacle that has already proven embarrassing for christie amid the prosecution's claims that he knew of the george washington bridge access lane closings as they happened. there is a potential consolation for christie in the morning consult poll. two republicans he helped elect in blue states against long odds as chairman of the republican governors association are among the most popular in the country. massachusetts gov. charlie baker and maryland gov. larry hogan both have 70 percent approval ratings and disapproval ratings of 18 percent and 17 percent, respectively. only republican south dakota gov. dennis daugaard is more popular, with a 74 percent approval rating. the margin of error for the new jersey poll results is plus or minus 2 percentage points.      new jersey christie among the most unpopular governors in the country, poll finds      
__label__0 the national rifle association’s new spot is aimed at people who are already afraid, and hammers hillary clinton for wanting to leave them defenseless. the gun rights group said it’s spending $5 million to run the spot on national cable and on regional stations in pennsylvania, north carolina, nevada, ohio and virginia. the ad does not mention donald trump, who the group endorsed in may. but it does dovetail with messages that both he and the nra have delivered before, casting clinton as an elitist who would take away individuals’ guns while benefiting from armed protection herself. story continued below the ad, called “nightstand,” shows a woman, alone in bed, awakened in the night by an intruder. she dashes for a landline phone, and a gun stored in a safe. but it fades away before she can grab it. a narrator says the average 911 response time is 11 minutes. “hillary clinton would take away her right to self defense, and with supreme court justices, hillary can,” the narrator says. “don’t let hillary leave you protected with nothing but a phone.” self defense against other people has become the top reason for gun ownership in the united states, according to a new study from harvard and northeastern university researchers. about two-thirds listed that reason for owning guns in 2015, the trace reported, and handgun ownership has risen proportionally compared with rifles. that’s despite drops in violent crime over recent decades. while clinton has made tighter gun laws, including universal background checks, a centerpiece of her campaign, she has not said she wants to ban firearms or repeal the second amendment. however, the nra points to comments she made at a fundraiser that the supreme court is “wrong on the second amendment,” an apparent reference to a 2008 case that affirmed an individual’s right to bear arms. with its latest buy, the nra has spent more than $11 million to support trump’s candidacy, adding to its status as the biggest outside spender. the group’s previous spot highlighted that clinton has armed protection, even as she would restrict it for others. trump recently seized on this line of argument as well, in a way that some interpreted as inciting violence. speaking friday in miami, trump called for her “bodyguards” — the u.s. secret service — to disarm. “take their guns away. she doesn’t want guns … let’s see what happens to her. take their guns away, ok? it’d be very dangerous,” trump said. that followed an ad-lib in august when he said “second amendment people” could stop her from nominating supreme court justices if she wins the election.      nra warns voters that clinton will leave them unprotected      
__label__0 the “horrible” shooting death of an unarmed black man in tulsa, oklahoma, on friday is “just unbearable and needs to be intolerable,” hillary clinton said tuesday. speaking to radio host steve harvey, clinton anxiously contrasted herself and her opponent, donald trump. “oh my gosh, can i have the whole hour?” clinton said when asked what separates her from the republican presidential nominee. “i think it really comes down to our visions and our values. you know, i have a vision where we continue to pursue equality and justice and opportunity for everybody.” story continued below clinton highlighted how she’s been a champion for minorities and women and touted her plans to raise incomes, create more good jobs, make colleges — including historically black colleges and universities — more affordable and address systemic racism before talking about the tulsa shooting unprompted. “this horrible shooting — again. how many times do we have to see this in our country?” clinton asked, referring to the incident in which terence crutcher, an unarmed black man, was shot dead by police despite having his hands up as he walked to his suv with armed officers behind him. “in tulsa? an unarmed man? with his hands in the air? i mean, this is just unbearable and it needs to be intolerable.” for her part, clinton suggested that she could be part of the solution to reform policing practices and remove bias by appealing to white americans. “you know, maybe i can, by speaking directly to white people, say, ‘look, this is not who we are.’ we’ve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias,” clinton said. “there are good, honorable, cool-headed police officers. we’ve seen them in action in new york over the last, you know, 48 hours because of the terrorist attack. we can do better. we have got to rein in what is absolutely inexplicable, and we’ve got to have law enforcement respect communities and communities respect law enforcement because they have to work together.” the former secretary of state also recalled meeting marian wright edelman, who founded the children’s defense fund, as a law school student. “that gave me the opportunity to really see what we need to do because i believe you’ve gotta change both laws and hearts,” clinton said. “we’ve gotta change laws to protect people, to protect everything about them, and we’ve got to be a clear and loud voice for our society being what it should be: the city on the hill striving for the more perfect union,” she continued. “and that’s my view. and i don’t think that’s how my opponent sees it.”      clinton: tulsa shooting by police should be 'intolerable’      
__label__0 it’s no coincidence donald trump rolled out his child care proposal this week in suburban philadelphia, with his daughter ivanka by his side. to win pennsylvania, the gop nominee must remain competitive in the populous suburbs that ring the state’s largest city. recent polls suggest he’s not even close. story continued below and unless trump can boost his performance on the outskirts of cities like philadelphia, milwaukee, detroit and columbus, ohio — particularly in the more affluent suburbs where middle-class women and college-educated white voters have eyed him askance — he risks being overwhelmed by the large democratic margins delivered by the nearby big cities. “he’s played the white, working-class speech,” said terry madonna, a veteran pennsylvania pollster, referring to the message trump has aimed at working class white men in economically struggling communities. “he’s not really made an appeal to [suburban] individuals.” the suburbs, where 47 percent of all votes were cast in 2012, went narrowly for romney after voting narrowly for barack obama in 2008. this time around, with trump doing little to tailor his message beyond his base of disaffected white men, he’s lagging far behind romney’s performance. a franklin and marshall college poll in late august showed hillary clinton with a 45-31 advantage in the philadelphia suburbs. an analysis from the milwaukee journal sentinel revealed drastic underperformance by trump in suburban milwaukee’s waukesha county, a conservative bastion where gop candidates typically run up huge margins. while trump led clinton by 45 percent to 32 percent over the summer, he was far behind romney’s pace there — the 2012 gop nominee carried waukesha by 67 percent to 32 percent. the story is similar in virginia, another swing state. according to an august washington post poll, trump was running well behind romney’s clip in the close-in d.c. suburbs and also in the northern virginia exurbs — places like loudoun county, a critical battleground that obama won by 5 points in 2012. “i think it's more a matter of tone than it is his platform,” said val digiorgio, chairman of the republican party of chester county, the only one of philadelphia’s four main suburban counties that romney won in 2012. “we're a county where fiscal conservatives tend to do very well. if he could convince these folks that he's a fiscal conservative and acts more presidential, he could win over some of these voters. they dislike hillary so intensely.” gop leaders and pollsters say trump can’t win without making inroads in the suburbs — and voters there are turned off by his bluster and sometimes-erratic nature. but many also say clinton’s unpopularity is keeping trump in the hunt. “there are some voters out there, they would prefer not to vote for clinton, but they have yet to see trump as a viable alternative,” added john brabender, a gop strategist who helped steer rick santorum to a senate victory in pennsylvania. “trump can still take advantage of it. trump needs to show a comfort level from a personality and temper standpoint.” trump’s temperament has been a persistent issue throughout the campaign — nowhere more than in the suburbs — but there are signs an image makeover is underway. aside from his uneven attempts to moderate some positions, eschew some of his harsher rhetoric and hew more closely to a script with the use of a teleprompter, the campaign has been dispatching his children and their spouses to the critical suburban counties that could decide his fate. on sept. 11, trump’s daughter-in-law lara made an unannounced stop in painesville, ohio — in suburban cleveland’s lake county — for a 9/11 memorial event. she’s also been active in her native north carolina, where she reportedly helped open a field office in the charlotte suburbs. she’s also joining trump’s other women surrogates to help soften his image in these key communities. trump’s daughter, ivanka, stood alongside her father to unveil trump’s new child care plan in delaware county, a democratic-leaning suburb of philadelphia,. she’s also arranging a trip to colorado next week — after a saturday visit to the denver suburbs by her father — for a series of events. last week, donald trump jr. was also in colorado too for events in downtown denver — one with millennials, one with sportsmen — before heading north for a fundraiser in windsor. the campaign is also in talks to send one of the trump kids next month to chester county, another crucial suburb outside philadelphia, when the local gop holds its fall reception. trump supporters view the candidate's children as highly effective surrogates who can smooth some of the mogul’s rougher edges and articulate (or talk around) some of trump’s harsher policies and rhetoric, the central challenge trump has faced to making inroads in the suburbs. “the important thing is that you’re sending people that connect with people in the community,” said robert blaha, trump’s colorado campaign chairman. “ivanka coming and talking to young millennial women -- like the role she played last night on the stage — the more you can connect with those groups, the more people can understand the candidate.” the suburbs, of course, aren’t a monolithic voting bloc. while trump’s struggles appear most acute in the affluent suburbs and among minorities in more mature suburbs, he’s actually well-positioned to make gains in some of the more industrial suburbs, which are prevalent in ohio. “a lot of suburbs have mini rust belts within them, and the same sort of angry, white working class voters have found trump appealing,” said larry levy, executive dean of the national center for suburban studies at hofstra university. “when you add it all up, the give and the take, trump is almost certainly going to do worse than prior republicans. a big tiebreaker is the number of new immigrants and other minorities, are the fastest growing population bloc in many suburbs.” in ohio, levy noted, the cleveland suburbs are riper targets for trump because of their industrial tilt, while the columbus suburbs are full of those more affluent white voters that haven’t warmed to trump. suburban republican leaders say that even in places where trump may be lagging behind romney’s performance, they see some recent evidence his fortunes may be improving. “our polling indicates he's down among the more affluent, suburban part of the county,” digiorgio, the chester county chairman, said. “i'd say he's rebounded since then. he's probably still losing chester county.” dale fellows, chairman of the cleveland-area lake county gop, said he’s seen an uptick in support for trump among women. he noted the recent visit by lara trump, who was accompanied by trump surrogates lynnette hardaway and rochelle richardson, the youtube personalities who go by the names diamond and silk. “republican women are starting to become more engaged,” he said. “that’s, i think, going to make a big difference in the outcome of the election.” in virginia’s loudoun county, outside of washington d.c., trump is still working to put his base together. “i’ll be honest, that’s something that’s still happening,” said will estrada, chairman of the county gop. but he points to what he views as some optimistic signs — from a mad rush to claim trump lawn signs to a decision by longtime trump hater and prominent conservative radio host mark levin, a resident of the county in leesburg, to relent and announce his support for trump. “every day that gets closer to election day, we’re seeing the base come on board with donald trump,” he said.      trump's suburban struggles      
__label__0 elizabeth, n.j. — a suspicious device found in a trash can near a train station exploded early monday as a bomb squad was attempting to disarm it with a robot, officials said. elizabeth mayor christian bollwage said the fbi was working to disarm one of five devices found in the same bag in a trash can by two men at around 8:30 p.m. sunday near the elizabeth train station. the men had reported seeing wires and a pipe coming out of the package, bollwage said. story continued below there was no immediate report of injuries or damage. the mayor warned that other explosions were expected. fbi agents and police converged on an apartment above a fried chicken restaurant near the train station before 6 a.m. monday, but it was not clear whether their search of the dwelling was connected to the explosion. new jersey transit service trains resumed service on the northeast corridor and north jersey coast line at 5:30 a.m. monday, but they faced residual delays because service was suspended after the devices were found. amtrak was operating on a modified schedule. train passengers reported being stuck on amtrak and nj transit trains for hours sunday night, while some trains moved in reverse to let passengers off at other stations. amtrak said 2,400 passengers were affected and trains were being brought in to other stations for people to get other transportation. it wasn't clear when the elizabeth station would be open, a threat to cause major issues on the monday morning commute into new york. the discovery of the suspicious package came a day after an explosion in manhattan injured 29 people, and an unexploded pressure-cooker device was found four blocks away in new york city. also saturday, a pipe bomb exploded about an hour from the elizabeth train station in seaside park, new jersey, forcing the cancellation of a military charity 5k run. officials said it didn't appear that those two incidents were connected, though they weren't ruling anything out. investigators didn't immediately comment on whether they thought the elizabeth incident was connected to either of the two blasts. bollwage said that he wasn't willing to say that elizabeth had become a target and that it was possible that someone worried about the authorities was trying to get rid of the package. "i'm extremely concerned for the residents of the community, but more importantly extremely concerned for everyone in the state and country where someone can just go and drop a backpack into a garbage can that has multiple explosives in it," bollwage said. "you have to wonder how many people could have been hurt."      device near new jersey train station explodes while fbi investigates

arrived here on sunday night when two men walked out of hector’s place restaurant near the city’s train station and found a backpack containing five explosives resting atop a municipal garbage can, mayor j. christian bollwage said. story continued below “after finding that the backpack contained ‘wires and a pipe,’ the mayor said, the men dropped the item in the street and contacted the elizabeth police department shortly about 8:45 p.m. the police, in turn, called the union county bomb squad, and the investigation was quickly turned over to the f.b.i. and the new jersey state police, mr. bollwage said. the f.b.i. then sent in a pair of robots and determined that the backpack held five bombs, some of which were pipe bombs, the mayor said. around 12:30 a.m., the robots

crusader coalition.’ “the amaq news agency, media wing of the islamic state in iraq and the levant (isil), has used nearly identical language in taking credit for at least a half-dozen other attacks in western countries in recent months, analysts say. if confirmed, the episode also marks a new chapter in isil’s link to minnesota. isil’s claim, a little more than 12 hours after dahir a. adan, 22,

could sign literally the first day in office.’ “over the summer, i interviewed several dozen people about what the united states could expect from donald trump’s first term. campaign advisers shared his plans, his associates relayed conversations, and i consulted veterans of five republican administrations, along with economists, war gamers, historians, legal scholars, and political figures in europe, asia, and latin america. most of the people i spoke with outside the campaign expected trump to lose. but they also expected his impact to endure, and they identified examples of the ways in which he had already altered political chemistry far beyond the campaign. after seventy years of american efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, trump has suggested that south korea and japan

__label__0 bill clinton defended his wife and the clinton foundation in an interview that aired monday, saying he trusted the state department to make sure there wasn’t a conflict of interest between the foundation’s donors and hillary clinton’s work at state. “i trusted the state department wouldn't do anything they shouldn't do, from a meeting to a favor,” the former president said in an interview with npr. story continued below he said some donors may have given to the foundation to build a relationship with the clintons, but most contributed because they supported the work of the foundation. “melinda gates didn't get involved in the no ceilings project with hillary because she needed to support her, or me, or the foundation for access,” he said. clinton also suggested that his wife’s unpopularity with voters is due in part to the negative coverage of the ongoing email scandal. “they're responding to the fact that this email thing was treated like the most important event since the end of world war ii,” he said. “i wonder if there's a man in america that could have taken what she's been through in the last year and a half.”      bill clinton on foundation controversy: 'i trusted the state department'      
__label__0 donald trump on monday morning claimed credit for accurately calling the weekend’s explosion in manhattan a bombing, even before full details were in, as the republican presidential nominee attempts to exploit the latest terror threats to boost his campaign. trump slammed the media for attacking him over his early use of the bomb term and accused them of editing out clips of democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton using a similar term. (cnn came under fire for using a clip of hillary clinton that axed her reference to the bombings, the first response from her gaggle with reporters saturday.) story continued below “if you saw her in the back of the plane — and she used the word ‘bombs’ also, by the way. i heard — i didn’t see it — but i heard i was criticized for calling it correctly,” trump told “fox and friends” in a telephone interview. “but what i said was exactly correct. i should be a newscaster because i called it before the news.” trump claimed “everybody” has said that he was right but “called it too soon.” “ok, give me a break,” he continued. “but hillary clinton used the word ‘bombs’ shortly thereafter and nobody said anything about it. and somebody said some of them edit that word out. they took it out. hey, folks, it’s a rigged system, and i’ve been saying it for a long time. and the news is as dishonest as anybody there is.” trump told supporters at a rally in colorado springs, colorado, on saturday night that “a bomb went off,” a remark that preceded public confirmation from local officials as they responded to an explosion that injured 29 people. “just before i got off the plane, a bomb went off in new york, and nobody knows exactly what’s going on, but boy, we are living in a time,” he said saturday. clinton, however, did the same thing, all the while attacking her opponent for his untimely assessment. speaking to reporters aboard her campaign plane saturday evening, clinton said that she had been briefed “about the bombings in new york and new jersey and the attack in minnesota.” despite using a similar term as trump, though, the former secretary of state dinged her rival just moments later. “i think it's important to know the facts about any incident like this,” she said. “i think it's always wiser to wait until you have information before making conclusions because we are just in the beginning stages of trying to determine what happened.” the real estate mogul suggested the media were attacking him not because he cited the explosion as a bombing before it was confirmed but because polls are tightening. national polls released last week by fox news and cbs news/new york times show a tight race between both candidates in a head-to-head, with trump leading by 1 percentage point in the fox news poll but trailing by 2 percentage points in the cbs news/new york times survey. “the reason is because my poll numbers now are so good that they’re so worried,” he said. respondents to the fox news poll narrowly favor clinton as the candidate they think would perform better on the terrorism and national security front, 47 percent to 46 percent. terrorism has punctuated the presidential campaign, with domestic and international attacks striking areas including san bernardino, california; orlando, florida; and paris and nice, france. the attacks, at times, have yielded very different responses from the candidates trying to convince americans that they can best handle these threats as commander in chief. clinton has tried to position herself as the steady hand america needs, while trump has portrayed himself as a strong leader who will obliterate terror threats. clinton’s responses to such incidents are usually much more cautious and measured than trump’s, who is often criticized for his actions in the wake of terror attacks. case in point: following the domestic attacks in san bernardino and orlando, trump proposed a temporary ban on muslims that he has since modulated and triumphantly tweeted that he is appreciative of “the congrats for being right on radical islamic terrorism.” on monday, he seemingly recommended profiling, arguing that law enforcement officials “know who a lot of these people are” but “don’t wanna be accused of profiling and they don’t wanna be accused of all sorts of things.” “we don’t wanna do any profiling,” trump said. “if somebody looks like he’s got a massive bomb on his back, we won’t go up to that person and say, ‘i’m sorry,’ because if he looks like he comes from that part of the world, we’re not allowed to profile. give me a break.”      trump takes credit for 'bomb' call: 'i should be a newscaster'      
__label__0 new york — police released a photo of a 28-year-old immigrant wanted for questioning monday in bombings that rocked a manhattan neighborhood and a new jersey shore town, and new york's governor and mayor said the blasts are looking increasingly like an act of terrorism with a foreign connection. ahmad khan rahami, a naturalized u.s. citizen from afghanistan with an address in elizabeth, new jersey, should be considered armed and dangerous, new york city mayor bill de blasio said in one of a series of tv appearances just minutes after the photo was released. story continued below in addition to the blast in manhattan's chelsea neighborhood on saturday, a pipe bomb exploded in a new jersey shore town before a charity 5k race and an unexploded pressure cooker device was found blocks away from the explosion site in chelsea. on sunday, five explosive devices were discovered at an elizabeth train station. new jersey state police said monday, citing the fbi, that the bombings in chelsea and the new jersey shore town seaside park were connected. no one was injured in the jersey blast. new york gov. andrew cuomo said as investigators gathered information they learned there were "certain commonalities among the bombs," leading authorities to believe "that there was a common group behind the bombs." "we want to get this guy in for questioning," de blasio said on cnn. "we need the facts to be able to piece all this together. ... i think we're going to know a lot more in the course of the day. things are moving very quickly." early monday, fbi agents swarmed an apartment above a fried chicken restaurant in elizabeth that's tied to rahami. the activity came hours after one of five devices found at the nearby elizabeth train station exploded while a bomb squad robot attempted to disarm it. no one was injured. saturday night's blast in the bustling chelsea neighborhood injured 29 people, and another unexploded device made out of pressure cooker was found several blocks away. in the immediate aftermath of that bombing, de blasio and cuomo were careful to say there was no evidence of a link to international terrorism. both said monday that appears to be changing. "the more we learn with each passing hour, is it looks more like terrorism," de blasio said in a later interview on ny1 news. cuomo, in a separate interview on msnbc, said: "today's information suggests it may be foreign related but we'll see where it goes. ... my operating premise is anytime, anywhere, seven days a week you could have an incident like this." the white house said president barack obama was briefed throughout the night and early monday on the investigation into bombs found in new york city and new jersey. spokesman josh earnest said obama will comment publicly later monday. on sunday night, fbi agents in brooklyn stopped "a vehicle of interest" in the investigation of the manhattan explosion, according to fbi spokeswoman kelly langmesser. she wouldn't provide further details, but a government official and a law enforcement official who were briefed on the investigation told the associated press that five people in the car were being questioned at an fbi building in manhattan. the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the ongoing investigation. no one has been charged, and the investigation is continuing, langmesser said. cuomo, touring the site of saturday's blast in chelsea, said the unexploded pressure cooker device appeared "similar in design" to the bomb that exploded in chelsea. on sunday, a federal law enforcement official said the chelsea bomb contained a residue of tannerite, an explosive often used for target practice that can be picked up in many sporting goods stores. the discovery of tannerite may be important as authorities probe whether the two new york city devices and the pipe bomb at the jersey shore are connected. cellphones were discovered at the site of both bombings, but no tannerite residue was identified in the new jersey bomb remnants, in which a black powder was detected, said the official, who wasn't authorized to comment on an ongoing investigation and spoke to the ap on condition of anonymity. the pipe bomb exploded saturday in seaside park, new jersey, before a charity 5k race to benefit marines and sailors. the race was canceled and no one was injured. the bombings in new york city and new jersey happened the same day that a man stabbed and injured nine people at a minnesota mall before an off-duty police officer fatally shot him. the st. cloud police chief said the man reportedly made at least one reference to allah and asked a victim if he or she was muslim before attacking. the islamic state group has claimed responsibility.      28-year-old man sought in manhattan blast      
__label__0 the islamic state and its supporters shocked north america and europe over the past year with a series of attacks, sowing public fear and becoming the top security issue in the u.s. presidential election. journalist rukmini callimachi has become an indispensable guide to understanding the group—and cutting through the fog of misinformation from politicians. we asked graeme wood, a journalist known for his own groundbreaking atlantic cover story tracing the islamic state’s intellectual roots, to talk with callimachi about what it’s like to try to penetrate one of the world’s most dangerous and shadowy organizations—and what we’re still getting wrong. graeme wood: we’re still shocked and surprised by what isis does, even though this has been going on for years. the continued shock is partly due to their violence, but i wonder if it might be partly our fault, as journalists, for failing to help the public understand isis. what are we doing wrong? rukmini callimachi: the systemic failure in the media in covering isis is that the majority of reporters are doing it in a semaphore fashion. their main entree to the group is what u.s. officials and analysts say, and they’re not contacting members of the terror group or really studying its propaganda. i can’t think of any other beat where we do that. if we cover a court case involving a murderer, we would still seek out the side of that murderer, even as we realize that what people say is going to be self-serving. wood: you’ve now interacted with many isis people—including in person. what do they have in common? callimachi: first, i would say, is ideology. i have never spoken to any member of these groups, not just isis, but also al qaeda, shabab, etc., who wasn’t driven by the ideology. beyond that, a lot of people are wounded in some way—they’ve fallen out of society in some manner. so the sunday school teacher in washington state, who in three months converted online and was planning for travel to the islamic state, had been born with fetal alcohol syndrome, couldn’t hold down a job, had very few friends. you see an emptiness at the core of this person. all of the ones i’ve spoken to seem to have veered off course from lives we consider acceptable and successful. of course, there are others like osama bin laden, who was a wealthy and successful businessperson. wood: why do they talk to you? callimachi: it’s become extremely difficult to speak to active isis members now. i was speaking to them in 2015, and the last one was killed in a drone strike. so now, if i’m speaking to them, it’s after they’ve defected. of course there is self-selection there, because these are people who became disaffected. wood: do you think it helps that you’re a woman? callimachi: it’s a double-edged sword. i’ve had countless jihadis shut me down straightaway and say, “i’m not allowed to speak to any woman who is not my relative.” but among the few i’m able to get through to, i think that being female makes me more approachable, soft, all the stereotypes of what female means. wood: what are the biggest remaining mysteries? what are the things we need to know that would really help us understand the group? callimachi: i’m really curious as to the actual structure of the emni [the intelligence unit that handles foreign attacks]. and abu muhammad al-adnani, the head of it. there are so few pictures of him. we don’t even really know what he looks like. for somebody with this outsized influence projecting murder abroad, you’d think that we would know a lot more by now. and then the role of the hostages. one of isis’ biggest propaganda coups was the beheadings of the aid workers and journalists. is [emni], the group that is exporting fighters overseas, also the one that was holding james foley and john cantlie and kayla mueller? wood: in one frightening quote, a jailed isis supporter tells you he thinks the number of isis operatives who have been sent to europe is in the hundreds. why haven’t we seen more attacks? callimachi: you have to keep in mind that there’s a number of logistical hurdles that they have to jump through in europe in order to get explosives or guns. so for example, the villejuif shooter in april 2015 who planned to attack a church: according to french press reports, he was instructed by isis to go to a sandwich shop, and the weapons would be waiting for him in a car parked outside. he was just told the make of the car, told to go there, told to pick them up. putting that kind of attack together, using encrypted communications or other means, is not easy. but during the height of ramadan, i was covering one or two attacks a week. these are people willing to die. wood: one change we’ve seen is a dramatic increase in body counts per attack. for a long time, they were very low, with many attacks killing no one but the attacker, but now with paris, orlando and nice, the numbers are much higher. do you think that isis is planning a spectacular attack, along the september 11 model—or would that be too risky for them, too likely to be detected? callimachi: they’re implementing what was the strategy of al qaeda, which was to have attacks of different levels simultaneously. … so the idea is, on the one hand you have these spectacular attacks that take months to plan, and others like reda hame, a french national, who went to syria and was there for about a week, given a couple of days of target practice and one day of encryption training, sent back and arrested almost immediately. and then there are the ones inspired solely through digital means, through the group reaching out through its propaganda and inciting them to attack. from what we are seeing, they are trying to do all three at the same time. it seems to me that a 9/11-style attack is impractical. they’d be putting in so many resources and so much time—but they can get the same horrific results from a guy with a truck. the death count is not the same, but the emotional impact for people in france was significant, and it took just a rental-car contract. wood: we’ve both written about isis’ habit of justifying its actions with religious argument. what’s the best evidence for and against the view that a religious vision is at the core of what isis is doing? callimachi: people who have left the group talk about how a religious inspiration took them to isis. it was their feeling of being marginalized as muslims in the society where they were living, and then buying into the promise of a caliphate and of a muslim land that is governed as in the time of the prophet. i have yet to meet anybody, or speak to anybody, who was not religiously motivated at some level. there are other things: the excitement of taking part in a war, a sense of belonging. wood: when you talk to people who have removed themselves from isis, what do they say? callimachi: they say that there comes a moment when the inconsistencies and apparent hypocrisies of their sheikh lets them down, and they begin rereading scripture and find ways that vouch for a nonliteralist reading of the koran. we know that muhammad waged war against the qurayshi tribe, his own tribe, and it’s from that conflict that much of the concept of jihad and verses that isis now uses to justify beheadings come from. a young man just told me that he went back and read this carefully [and saw] the prophet and his people were fighting the quraysh because they were not allowing the prophet and his people to practice their religion. we are now in a society, he said, where the prophet muhammad could practice his religion freely. so anyway, i find that interesting, you know: scripture is also the way out. our guide to the thinkers, doers and visionaries transforming american politics.      what politicians don’t get about the islamic state

2011, with even less space in parliament for any real opposition party | vasily batanov/afp via getty images by oliver carroll 9/19/16, 3:14 pm cet updated 9/20/16, 6:08 am cet moscow — two years of economic recession, western sanctions and wars in ukraine and syria haven’t shaken vladimir putin’s grip on power. instead, sunday’s election to the russian state duma saw the president’s united russia party win a greater share of the vote than in 2011, with even less space in parliament for any real opposition party. there was never any doubt about the outcome, and many russians didn’t bother to turn out. nationwide, only 48 percent voted compared to 60 percent in the previous elections for the lower house of parliament. the numbers were even worse in moscow and st. petersburg, bastions of the educated middle classes and traditionally more protest-oriented. this time, despite some reports of voter fraud, there were no signs of demonstrations. “they did everything [so] that people would ignore the elections, from holding them just after the summer break, to the most low-key election campaign i can remember,” said political expert grigorii golosov. on monday, with 93 percent of the votes counted, united russia had 54.2 percent of the vote, up from 49.3 percent five years ago. russia’s new electoral system, a mix of party lists and single mandate districts, means that putin’s party wins a huge constitutional majority of 343 seats in the 450-seat duma — compared to 238 seats in 2011. with its super majority, united russia will have free rein over parliament, dropping the need to bargain with friendly opposition parties. it can also change the constitution at will. in southern russia a cctv camera caught a polling official stuffing a ballot box. on the latest figures, the communist party will likely finish second, slightly ahead of the liberal democratic party of russia, with the center-left just russia fourth. they were all in the previous parliament, and traditionally support the government on many issues and refrain from attacking putin. while there is some pressure for the communists to be more independent— their leader gennady zyuganov at one point refused to recognize the results — all three can be expected to remain loyal. all in all, it was a terrible election for russia’s liberal fringe, which now faces the prospect of obliteration. they’re down from one seat in the previous duma to none. their best hope, the liberal opposition yabloko party, scored less than 2 percent of the vote, and will now lose out on government funding. the liberal-democratic parnas party failed to get 1 percent, and most of the candidates supported by exiled oligarch mikhail khodorkovsky were wiped out. also on politico oliver carroll also on politico kristen east also on politico vince chadwick the centrist opposition also failed to break through in any of the single-mandate districts. the closest candidate, yabloko’s dmitry gudkov, lost in the moscow suburbs. as he faced defeat, gudkov told politico he had battled the full might of the government machine, but said that the result was ultimately down to the passivity of russian democrats. “voters didn’t turn up,” he said. “russia’s middle class now is about to get what it deserves.” only one independent and two right-wing populist candidates made it into the duma, but they won’t give much support to the liberal opposition. one of the nationalist winners of the single-mandate run-offs was vitaly milonov, a former deputy of the st. petersburg city government who has campaigned on an anti-gay rights platform. although the outcome was never in doubt, the kremlin made sure that the voting procedure was cleaned up from 2011, when voter fraud sparked anti-putin protests. however, there were still questionable incidents, the most obvious being in rostov in southern russia where a cctv camera caught a polling official stuffing a ballot box. in other places, voters were lured to the polls with free sausages and other goodies. denis korotkov, a correspondent for the st. petersburg news portal fontanka, managed to vote several times. he immediately wrote about the incident and brought it to the attention of the authorities. law enforcement subsequently detained korotkov — who is now threatened with prosecution for electoral violations. while the opposition faces being wiped out, the upshot for putin is that his control of russia is stronger than ever. he is likely to decide to run for a fourth term as president in 2018. as part of the preparations for yet another run, putin recently reshuffled his closest advisers, weeding out those who might dare to challenge him and replacing them with lesser-known men completely dependent on his favor. the election also means there is likely to be little change in russia’s policies on ukraine and syria, or in its economic program. “in practical terms, little will change with the new parliament,” wrote capital economics, an analysis firm, in a post-election note. “united russia already held a majority in parliament, and didn’t face effective opposition. the strong showing for united russia (and disappointing results for the opposition) suggests that the direction of policy will be largely unchanged.”  © 2016 politico sprl log in to access content and manage your

__label__0 hillary clinton on monday urged americans not to get “diverted and distracted” by donald trump's inflammatory words as the united states combats the threat posed by the islamic state. “let’s not get diverted and distracted by the kind of campaign rhetoric we hear coming from the other side. this is a serious challenge,” clinton told reporters after delivering a statement from white plains, new york. “we are well equipped to meet it. and we can do so in keeping with smart law enforcement, good intelligence and in concert with our values.” story continued below clinton addressed the recent string of attacks in new york, new jersey and minnesota on monday, remarking that the terrorist threat of the islamic state is real while also casting herself as the only candidate with the experience necessary to handle such threats. “this threat is real but so is our resolve. americans will not cower. we will prevail. we will defend our country and defeat the evil, twisted ideology of the terrorists," said clinton, who implicitly contrasted her role as head of the state department and trump’s inexperience in politics and government as she declared, "i’m the only candidate in this race who has been part of the hard decisions to take terrorists off the battlefield.” clinton also presented herself as a longtime advocate of “tough vetting” and called for an improved visa system. her response monday contradicted trump’s message. while the republican presidential nominee seemingly encouraged racial profiling to help law enforcement stop future attacks during a phone interview with “fox and friends,” clinton talked up her bona fides. “i was part of the national security team that worked with president obama, developed strategies to fight the terrorists — sometimes that involved direct kinetic action, sometimes that involved working with allies and partners, sometimes that involved capture,” she said. “i won’t get into classified information, but i have sat at that table in the situation room, i have analyzed the threats, i have contributed to actions that have neutralized our enemies. i know how to do this and i understand how we don’t want this to get even bigger than it already is.” as for trump’s contributions to the terrorism conversation, clinton cited his rhetoric as ammunition for the other side. “we know that donald trump’s comments have been used online for recruitment of terrorists,” she said. “we’ve heard that from former cia director michael hayden, who made it a very clear point when he said donald trump is being used as a recruiting sergeant in and for the terrorists. we know from the former head of the counterterrorism center, mike olsen, that the language that mr. trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries.” trump on monday again criticized president barack obama and clinton for refusing to go after “radical islamic terrorism.” but clinton brushed off the real estate mogul’s criticism of her record. “well, it’s like so much else he says: it’s not grounded in fact. it’s meant to, you know, make some kind of demagogic point,” clinton said. “and the facts are pretty clear that, you know, we still have challenges. that’s what i have been talking about throughout this campaign. i am prepared to, ready to actually take on those challenges, not engage in a lot of, you know, irresponsible, reckless rhetoric, but to do the hard work as i’ve done before, to put into place the strategies for local and state law enforcement for an intelligence surge, for the kind of preventive actions we need to take here at home and to intensify our efforts to defeat isis.” clinton suggested americans won’t hear her opponent’s plan, and not because it's secret. “he keeps saying he has a secret plan. well, the secret is he has no plan,” she said. “so let’s focus on what we really can do, and what i've laid out is a path forward that will keep us safer, protect our country and go after the terrorists to finally destroy them.”      clinton warns against getting 'distracted' by trump's terror talk      
__label__0 donald trump’s campaign on monday hit back at the white house’s characterization that the u.s. is in a “narrative fight” with the islamic state, insisting “we should all be very concerned” by the obama administration’s assessment. “for the u.s. troops in iraq and syria who are on the front lines against isis, it’s a real fight where we’ve lost real lives,” trump senior communications adviser jason miller said in a statement. “diminishing the threat the obama administration has allowed to materialize on its watch puts us all at risk and is another reminder that we need new leadership in the fight against radical islamic terrorism. hillary clinton has backed president obama’s failed isis strategy to the hilt, and voters should know whether she too shares the white house’s troubling assessment of the situation.” story continued below in an interview with cnn’s chris cuomo on monday, white house press secretary josh earnest pointed to the ongoing battle against the islamic state as a “narrative fight.” “when it comes to isil, we are in a fight, a narrative fight, with them. a narrative battle,” earnest said. “and what isil wants to do is they want to project that they are an organization that is representing islam in a fight and a war against the west, and a war against the united states. that is a bankrupt false narrative. it’s a mythology, and we have made progress in debunking that mythology.” during his phone interview with fox news on monday, trump seemingly suggested that law enforcement officials should profile muslims to stop terrorist attacks, a remark that came in response to the bombing in new york on saturday that injured 29 people, and again hammered president barack obama and hillary clinton for refusing to call out “radical islamic terrorism.” “here’s another element of this fight,” earnest added. “we can’t play into this narrative that somehow the united states or the west is against — is fighting against the muslim religion.”      trump's camp accuses obama aide of downplaying terror threat      
__label__0 united nations — the new york-area hunt for an afghan-born bombing suspect cast a pall on this week's gathering of international leaders at the u.n. general assembly, a session u.s. president barack obama plans to use to rally support for helping the world's refugees. instead, the search for and eventual capture monday of 28-year-old ahmad khan rahami gave a fresh talking point to republican presidential nominee donald trump, who wants to dramatically curtail u.s. admissions of refugees and other immigrants and who has criticized his democratic rival hillary clinton's more welcoming stance. story continued below "i just saw that and wanted to weep," a u.s.-based refugee advocate told politico as news spread of the manhunt. "trump is going to be all over this bullshit." and he was. "think of it," the real estate mogul told fox news on monday morning. "hillary clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands of these same people that are, you know, they have such hatred and sickness in their hearts. it’s sickness, but it’s — it’s sickness and it’s hatred, and she wants to allow hundreds of thousands." clinton responded, in a hastily arranged news conference on an airplane tarmac near her new york home, with a reiteration of her call for stricter "vetting" of immigrants and an "intelligence surge" to better identify terrorist threats. "so i am absolutely in favor of and have long been an advocate for tough vetting for making sure that we don't let people into this country, and not just people who come here to settle, but we need a better visa system," she said. but she sought to distinguish between terrorists like the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks and refugees in general, while taking a shot at trump for good measure. "these were not refugees who got into airplanes and attacked our city and our country," clinton said. "so let's not get diverted and distracted by the kind of campaign rhetoric we hear coming from the other side." authorities were still piecing together details about rahami, a naturalized u.s. citizen who was born in afghanistan but whose last known address was in elizabeth, new jersey. according to media reports, he was wounded in a shootout with police in linden, new jersey, but taken into custody by noon monday. he is wanted in connection with a blast that hurt 29 people over the weekend in the chelsea area of new york city, as well as other bombs found in the city and in new jersey. it was not immediately clear how rahami reached the united states, or whether he even arrived as a refugee. but activists acknowledged that such nuances would likely get lost in the debate this week as terrorism will likely become an even more prominent issue than it already is. this year's general assembly, and the many events on the sidelines, are tackling issues ranging from how to stop growing microbial resistance to antibiotics to climate change. the bloody civil war in syria, the battle against the islamic state terrorist network and the dilemma over north korea's nuclear program are also key topics. the world's refugee crisis — in which an unprecedented 65 million people are either displaced in their own countries or sought help in other states — is receiving special attention, however. on monday, u.n. secretary general ban ki-moon kicked off a summit of world leaders to discuss the topic. and on tuesday, obama will host his own refugee summit. of huge concern is the plight of syrian refugees, hundreds of thousands of whom have trekked to europe to escape the despair of refugee camps. during his opening remarks on monday morning, ban, who will leave the secretary-general's seat in just a few months, called on nations not to be afraid of refugees fleeing violence and persecution. "refugees and migrants are not to be seen a burden; they offer great potential, if only we unlock it," he said. "acting together, we can respond to rising xenophobia and turn fear into hope." as the u.n.-sponsored summit kicked off, millions of people in the new york area received alerts on their cell phones about the search for rahami, who authorities warned was likely armed and dangerous. refugee advocates say they have mixed feelings about the two summits. they believe the u.n.-sponsored event monday is falling short of concrete steps groups such as amnesty international and oxfam sought. the leaders gathered monday adopted the so-called new york declaration for refugees and migrants, but the statement puts off much of the heavy lifting of coming up with a new strategy for handling mass migration crises until 2018. there's more hope that the u.s.-sponsored event on tuesday will lead to tangible results, including serious commitments from the private sector on ways to assist refugees. but activists are disappointed that while obama is calling on other countries to double their intake of refugees, he isn't willing to lift the u.s. intake as much. obama has set a target of 110,000 refugee admissions, including a significant number from syria, in fiscal year 2017; some activists had hoped for 200,000. opposition among republicans in congress, which controls funding for the u.s. refugee resettlement program, likely stayed obama's hand. clinton said last year that she'd like to see the u.s. accept some 65,000 refugees from syria; but in the year since, she's stayed silent on any numbers. her campaign stresses that while clinton believes in keeping the u.s. refugee resettlement program intact as a symbol of american generosity, she believes newcomers must be properly screened. her relative reticence on the subject — at least as compared to trump — has rankled some refugee advocates, who now wonder whether, with the latest attack in new york, whether she will become even more shy. "it's really important that hillary make a strong statement supporting the fiscal year 2017 admissions goals set by president obama and make a commitment to continue to increase our annual refugee admissions once she's elected," said yasmine taeb of the friends committee on national legislation, a quaker lobby. taeb acknowledged the "tough political climate," noting "the rise in anti-muslim and anti-refugee rhetoric." but she urged world leaders not to "turn our backs on innocent women, men, and children fleeing violence and persecution." trump, clinton and obama were all set to hold bilateral meetings with world leaders in new york on monday. clinton and trump are due to meet egypt's president, while clinton also will meet ukraine's president and the prime minister of japan. obama's meetings include one with iraq's prime minister; the pair will likely discuss ways to keep up the fight against the islamic state. nolan d. mccaskill contributed to this report.      terror attacks complicate obama's refugee push      
__label__0 new york — an afghan immigrant wanted for questioning in the bombings that rocked a new york city neighborhood and a new jersey shore town was captured monday after being wounded in a shootout with police that erupted when he was discovered asleep in the doorway of a new jersey bar, authorities said. wabc-tv footage showed a man believed to be 28-year-old ahmad khan rahami being loaded into an ambulance on a stretcher in linden, new jersey. he appeared to be conscious and looking around. story continued below two officers were wounded in the gun battle but were not believed to have been seriously hurt, authorities said. linden mayor derek armstead said that the owner of a bar reported someone asleep in the doorway of his business. a police officer went to investigate and recognized the man as rahami, police and the mayor said. rahami pulled a gun and shot the officer — who was wearing a bulletproof vest — in the torso, and more officers joined in a running gun battle down the street and brought rahami down, police capt. james sarnicki said. the arrest came just hours after police issued a bulletin and photo of rahami, a naturalized u.s. citizen from afghanistan with an address in elizabeth, new jersey. authorities said the blasts were looking increasingly like an act of terrorism with a foreign connection. police did not disclose how they zeroed in on rahami as a person of interest in the bombing investigation but were known to be poring over surveillance video. at the same time, five people who were pulled over in a vehicle sunday night were being questioned by the fbi, officials said. the shootout came after a weekend of fear and dread in new york and new jersey. in addition to the blast that injured 29 people in manhattan's chelsea neighborhood on saturday, an unexploded pressure cooker bomb was found blocks away, and a pipe bomb exploded in a new jersey shore town before a charity race. no one was injured there. on sunday, five explosive devices were discovered in a trash can at an elizabeth train station. also on saturday, a man who authorities say referred to allah wounded nine people in a stabbing rampage at a minnesota mall before being shot to death by an off-duty police officer. the islamic state group claimed responsibility. authorities have not drawn any connection between the violence in minnesota and the bombings in the new york area. citing the fbi, new jersey state police said monday that the bombings in chelsea and the new jersey shore town seaside park were connected. new york gov. andrew cuomo said as investigators gathered information, they learned there were "certain commonalities among the bombs," leading authorities to believe "that there was a common group behind the bombs." before rahami's capture, cuomo said investigators have no reason to believe there are further threats, but the public should "be on constant guard." around the time rahami was taken into custody, president barack obama was in new york on a previously scheduled visit for a meeting of the u.n. general assembly, and said it was "extremely fortunate" nobody was killed in the bombings. he called on americans to show the world "we will never give in to fear." "we all have a role to play as citizens to make sure we don't succumb to that fear. and there's no better example of that than the people of new york and new jersey," the president said. "folks around here, they don't get scared." rahami lived with his family in elizabeth in an apartment above a fried-chicken restaurant owned by his father, on a busy street a few miles from the newark airport. early monday, fbi agents swarmed the apartment. elizabeth mayor christian bollwage said rahami's father, mohammad rahami, and two brothers sued the city after it passed an ordinance requiring the first american fried chicken restaurant to close early because of complaints from neighbors that it was a late-night nuisance. ryan mccann, of elizabeth, said that he often ate at the restaurant and recently began seeing the younger rahami working there more. "he's always in there. he's a very friendly guy, that's what's so scary. it's hard when it's home," mccann said. in the immediate aftermath of the new york bombing, de new york mayor bill de blasio and cuomo were careful to say there was no evidence of a link to international terrorism. both said monday that appeared to be changing. "the more we learn with each passing hour is it looks more like terrorism," de blasio said in an interview on ny1 news. cuomo said on msnbc: "today's information suggests it may be foreign-related, but we'll see where it goes." on sunday night, fbi agents in brooklyn stopped "a vehicle of interest" in the investigation of the manhattan explosion, according to fbi spokeswoman kelly langmesser. she wouldn't provide further details, but a government official and a law enforcement official who were briefed on the investigation told the associated press that five people in the car were being questioned at an fbi building in manhattan. the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the investigation. on sunday, a federal law enforcement official said the chelsea bomb contained a residue of tannerite, an explosive often used for target practice that can be picked up in many sporting goods stores. cellphones were discovered at the site of both the new york and new jersey bombings, but no tannerite residue was identified in the new jersey bomb remnants, in which a black powder was detected, said the official, who wasn't authorized to comment on the investigation and spoke to the ap on condition of anonymity. the pipe bomb that exploded saturday in seaside park went off before a charity 5k race to benefit marines and sailors. the race was canceled. one of the five devices found at the elizabeth train station exploded while a bomb squad robot tried to disarm it. no one was hurt.      police capture man sought in new york-area bombings      
__label__0 at least 858 people who had previously been ordered to be deported or removed from the u.s. were instead granted citizenship, the department of homeland security’s inspector general announced monday. the mistaken citizenships were granted, the department of homeland security explained in a press release, because neither its digital fingerprint repository nor the fbi’s fingerprint repository contain exhaustive records of individuals who have previously been deported. story continued below the discovery was made by the department of homeland security’s office of inspector general, which released a report monday on the incomplete fingerprint records and the mistakenly granted citizenships. the department of homeland security’s records are incomplete, the release said, because paper fingerprint cards used before 2008 were not consistently digitized. the fbi’s records are incomplete because fingerprints collected during immigration enforcement activities were not always shared with the bureau. the inspector general's report specified that those granted citizenship were only "potentially" ineligible and were not necessarily granted citizenship incorrectly. a statement from the department of homeland security said that the department is taking steps to correct the issues that led to the incomplete fingerprint records and that not all applicants whose records were incomplete wound up being granted citizenship. "it is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently. preliminary results from the file reviews show that in a significant number of these cases naturalization had been denied and that, in some, naturalization was not improperly granted," department spokesman neema hakim said in the statement. "other cases are subject to ongoing criminal investigation or to denaturalization proceedings that are pending or completed." in at least three cases, the inspector general’s office discovered previously-deported individuals who were granted citizenship and then obtained clearance for “security-sensitive work at commercial airports or maritime facilities and vessels.” the release said all three have since had their security credentials revoked. “this situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of u.s. citizenship through fraud,” inspector general john roth said. “to prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications, [u.s. citizenship and immigration services] needs access to these fingerprint records.” republican presidential candidate donald trump has made the vetting of immigrants as they enter the u.s. a major part of his presidential platform, suggesting during the gop primary that america temporarily ban all muslims from entering the u.s. until a more stringent vetting process could be put in place. he has since backed away from that proposal, which drew widespread criticism from both parties, in favor of a ban on immigration from “any nation that has been compromised by terrorism.”      u.s. mistakenly granted citizenship to hundreds of immigrants      
__label__0 even as law enforcement continues to investigate a series of bombings over the weekend in and around new york city, president barack obama said monday that military successes against the islamic state have exposed the militant group “as the failed cause that it is.” the president declined to offer specifics of the investigation into the bombings, referring reporters to the fbi and other law enforcement agencies for updates. but as the president was speaking, nbc news and other media outlets began reporting that ahmad rahami, a man wanted in connection with the bombings, had been taken into custody. story continued below law enforcement has not publicly tied rahami, a u.s. citizen of afghan descent, to any terrorist group but in his public statement monday, obama spoke not just about the investigation into the weekend’s attacks but also the global fight to combat terrorist groups like the islamic state and al qaeda. “we will continue to lead the global coalition on the fight to destroy isil, which is instigating a lot of people over the internet to carry out attacks. we are going to continue to go after them. we're going to take out their leaders, we're going to take out their infrastructure,” the president said from new york, where he will attend the united nations general assembly meeting later this week. “as we take away more of their territory, it exposes isil as the failed cause that it is. and it helps to undermine their ideology which over time will make it harder to recruit and inspire people to violence.” speaking specifically to the ongoing investigation into the bombings in new york and new jersey, the president said he had been briefed by fbi director james comey and had spoken with new york gov. andrew cuomo and new jersey gov. chris christie. the president also said that a “particularly high level of federal resources” were already in place in new york to assist with the un general assembly and that those resources would be able to assist in the investigations. recalling his conversations with governors cuomo and christie, obama praised new yorkers and new jerseyans for their toughness: “folks around here, you know, they don’t get scared. they are tough. they are resilient. they go about their business every single day.” “that kind of toughness and resoluteness and a recognition that neither individuals nor organizations like isil can ultimately undermine our way of life. that's the kind of strength that makes me so proud to be an american,” the president said. “by showing those who want to do us harm that they will never beat us, by showing the entire world that as americans we do not and never will give in to fear, that's going to be the most important ingredient in us defeating those who would carry out terrorist acts against us.”      obama calls islamic state a 'failed cause'      
__label__0 new york rep. peter king rejected former secretary of state hillary clinton’s focus on the need for law enforcement to do a better job of building trust with american muslims. instead, the 11-term congressman called for more surveillance within the community. “i disagree with her when she puts the emphasis on building trust with the muslim community, they have no reason not to trust the police,” king said on msnbc shortly after clinton answered questions from the press on the weekend’s bombing in manhattan. story continued below king is not new to this topic. his insistence to hold hearings on homegrown radicalization within islam drew comparisons to sen. joseph mccarthy’s infamous communist witch hunt. (king has said he considers such attacks on him a "badge of honor.") as she has before, clinton called for an intelligence surge to thwart isil’s efforts to inspire terror, but cautioned against a broader offensive against a faith. but the only way to gather such intelligence, king said, is to step up surveillance. “so listen, it's not going to be the handshake of a friendship that's going to bring muslim americans outside,” king said. “to get more intelligence, you have to do that by surveillance, by undercovers. that’s what has been done with every other ethnic group in this country when there is crime, whether it's the westies and the irish, whether it’s the italians and the mafia, that's how you do it. we shouldn't be pandering to political correctness."      rep. peter king: we shouldn't be 'pandering' to political correctness      
__label__0 the donald trump campaign has improved logistics for the traveling press following the candidate, putting the journalists in the motorcade and on a dedicated chase plane. though reporters covering the republican nominee will not necessarily travel at all times on the same plane as trump, they will now be in a dedicated "chase" plane and will drive within the trump motorcade. these moves will significantly improve travel for the media covering trump, who last week were left behind when reporters got stuck in new york city traffic trying to get a different airport than the one trump, whose motorcade cuts through traffic, was flying out of for an event in new hampshire. despite requests to wait for the traveling press, trump started the event without his traveling press corps and mocked them for being late. reporters will travel with trump on his plane "when logistically feasible," the campaign said, according to one member of trump's traveling press corps. trump campaign spokeswoman hope hicks, when asked whether the improved logistics were in reaction to last week's problems, said the move "has been in the works for weeks." neither campaign has a full protective pool, meaning reporters cover the candidate as the president is covered by the white house press corps, from leaving their residence to return. hillary clinton's press corps have a quasi-protective pool, and have been traveling with her on her plane and within her motorcade since the labor day holiday. however, her press corps is not with her at all times as was evidenced earlier this month when clinton fell ill and left a 9/11 memorial service early, leaving the press corps behind and without information for nearly two hours.      trump campaign improves press pool logistics      
__label__0 newark, n.j. — gov. chris christie was told of the george washington bridge lane closures as they were occurring in 2013, a federal prosecutor told jurors on monday in u.s. district court. david wildstein, who has already pleaded guilty to playing a role in the incident, and bill baroni, who is now on trial for his alleged role in the scheme, “bragged” about the traffic gridlock that lane closures were causing when they spoke with the republican governor at a sept. 11 memorial in lower manhattan, assistant u.s. attorney vikas khanna said. story continued below the two christie-appointed former port authority officials mentioned the democratic mayor of fort lee, mark sokolich, whom they are accused of trying to punish after he refused to endorse christie’s reelection campaign, the prosecutor said. “the evidence will show that baroni and wildstein were so committed to their plan that, during the precious moments they had alone with the governor, they bragged about the fact that there were traffic problems in fort lee and that mayor sokolich was not getting his calls returned,” khanna told jurors during his opening remarks monday morning. khanna did not elaborate on what was allegedly said during the conversation with christie, but he told jurors that “evidence in this case may show that others could have, should have, perhaps knew certain aspects of what was going on.” baroni, the former deputy executive director of the port authority of new york and new jersey, and bridget anne kelly, christie’s former deputy chief of staff, were indicted in may 2015 on charges of conspiracy, fraud and civil rights violations. christie, who is currently a top adviser to republican presidential nominee donald trump, has denied any knowledge or involvement in the lane-closing incident. and an ostensibly independent report commissioned by christie said, referring to a much publicized picture of christie and wildstein chatting at a public event three days into the manufactured traffic jams at the bridge, that there was “no evidence we have seen that the governor and wildstein actually had any substantive discussion of the fort lee lane realignment at that public event.” wildstein, a sharp-elbowed political operator who was a boyhood schoolmate of christie, has already implicated the two others and will testify during the trial. the trial is expected to last six weeks. the allegation that christie was told about the george washington bridge fort lee access lane closings as they were happening doesn’t exactly contradict the governor's own words. but the prosecution's version of the incident does not square with the governor’s own claims, or with the report on bridgegate produced by the outside firm hired by the christie administration. the allegation that the lane closings were mentioned to christie at a 9/11 commemoration ceremony in lower manhattan in 2013 is not new. but that 2014 report by the law firm gibson dunn & crutcher — commissioned by christie and paid for with millions in taxpayer funds — not only denied evidence of a "substantive" discussion, but also said, “it seems incredible that, in a public setting leading up to a 9/11 memorial event, surrounded by other government officials and scores of constituents seeking photographs and handshakes, anything substantive or inculpatory would have been discussed." the report went on to say that “even if credited, any passing reference by wildstein made in a social, public setting at the time of a public 9/11 memorial event to traffic issue in fort lee would not have been meaningful or memorable to the governor” and that christie “recalls no such exchange.” the prosecution's statement that wildstein and baroni bragged to the governor about what they had done runs directly counter to any characterization of the verbal update as a "passing reference" and makes it harder to imagine the exchange as one the governor could possibly fail to recall. baroni’s attorney, michael baldassare, told jurors during his opening statement that wildstein — the government’s star witness — told prosecutors that other officials played a role in the alleged scheme. “david wildstein implicated so many people in this activity that it will boggle your mind,” baldassare said. “they’re people at the highest levels of government in new jersey, and at the very top of the port authority.” at one point, baldassare called wildstein a “ventriloquist’s doll, sitting on christopher j. christie’s lap.” while baldassare said his client had no hand in shutting down the lanes or covering up the incident, he spent much of his time with the jury focused on wildstein, whom he said the governor’s office had sent to keep an eye on baroni. baldassare worked to impeach wildstein’s reputation, even cursing his name and apologizing before doing so. he repeatedly called wildstein a liar, saying he lied under oath before the grand jury that handed up the indictment in the case. “david wildstein is a vicious guy,” baldassare said, referring to comments he said former coworkers of wildstein had made about him. “he’s a bully. i’m sorry judge, everyone — he’s an asshole. he’s a horrible person. he’s the most complicated person i’ve ever met. he is a vindictive individual who would destroy your life.” “he had a twisted mind,” he added, again referring to others. “he’s maniacal. i apologize, again — david wildstein is a miserable prick. the governor referred to david wildstein as his fixer. his fixer. and the governor used to joke that david wildstein was his mr. wolf. mr. wolf from the movie ‘pulp fiction.’” the character, played by actor harvey keitel in the quentin tarantino film, was an underworld fixer who helped two of the movie’s main characters dispose of a body. at an appearance at a town hall event in morris county, christie avoided reporters' questions about the trial. linh tat contributed to this report. update: after this story was published, baldassare emailed to say that some of the derogatory comments he made about wildstein during the trial were quotes from people wildstein had once worked with. the story has been modified to reflect that.      new jersey federal prosecutor says christie knew about lane closings      
__label__0 an oil industry executive who has spoken out against animal rights is a leading contender for interior secretary should donald trump win the white house, two sources familiar with the campaign’s deliberations told politico on monday — a prospect that drew immediate condemnation from environmental activists. forrest lucas, the 74-year-old co-founder of oil products company lucas oil, is well-known in his native indiana, where in 2006 he won the naming rights to lucas oil stadium, the home of the indianapolis colts football team, for a reported $121.5 million over 20 years. he and his wife have given a combined $50,000 to the gubernatorial campaigns of trump's running mate, mike pence, according to indiana state records. story continued below lucas’ company, california-based lucas oil, is a fast-growing manufacturer of automotive oils, lubricants and other additives used in everything from cars to heavy-duty trucks. one person briefed by the trump campaign said lucas is a “front-runner” for the interior secretary job. the person, who was granted anonymity to talk about private discussions, added that trump wants a “more business-friendly and business experience-heavy cabinet.” but environmentalists quickly excoriated the idea of an oil industry executive leading the department that oversees national parks and wildlife refuges, along with decisions about offshore drilling, fracking regulations and protections for endangered species. "putting an oil executive in charge of our public lands and precious coasts in places like north carolina, virginia and florida is a virtual guarantee that trump's promise to throw open season on drilling in our special places will come true if he's elected," said khalid pitts, the sierra club's national political director. david turnbull, the campaigns director at anti-fossil-fuels group oil change usa, worried that trump's cabinet could be full of people with ties to the oil industry. they include harold hamm, the ceo of oklahoma oil company continental resources, who has emerged as a possible pick for trump's energy secretary. "catering to an industry dead-set on continued expansion of oil and gas drilling is not only totally out of step with climate science, but it's also out of step with the majority of americans who are calling for a swift transition to clean energy and robust action on climate change," turnbull said in an email. it would be nearly unprecedented for major oil executive to get the top job in the interior department. current secretary sally jewell was an engineer for mobil oil early in her career and often touts her experience fracking wells, although she is best known as a conservationist and former outdoor retail executive. lucas’ nomination would be a coup for the oil and gas industry, which has battled president barack obama’s interior department for years over everything from endangered species act listings to access to federal lands for drilling. trump has cultivated close ties to the oil industry, which was once skeptical of his campaign for president. "in a lot of ways, having an oil and gas friendly person in the interior department is more important to the oil and gas industry than having someone friendly at the energy department," one industry official said. nominating lucas would also break with the long-standing tradition of interior secretaries coming from western states. it would also likely draw rebukes from animal rights groups. lucas, who owns a ranch and serves on trump’s agriculture advisory committee, is one of the biggest donors to groups that attack the humane society and people for the ethical treatment of animals, and defend animal agriculture, hunting, meat consumption, rodeos and circuses. another source with knowledge of the transition operation said lucas was on a short list of about five names that are under consideration for the post, which has started to attract considerable interest from prominent “anti-conservation zealots.” donald trump jr., an avid hunter, has also publicly expressed interest in the job. earlier this year, lucas financed and produced a feature film called “the dog lover,” which portrays dog breeders and puppy mills as being unfairly targeted by animal rights groups. the movie was backed by protect the harvest, a nonprofit founded and chaired by lucas, that says it’s “keeping america free, fed & fun!” in 2014, lucas gave $250,000 to the protect the harvest pac, records show. roger ebert's website called the movie “shamelessly manipulative” and “a pretty bald piece of anti-[society for the prevention of cruelty to animals] and/or peta propaganda,” noting that the movie ends with a call to moviegoers to look into animal welfare groups before donating to them. animal rights supporters were quick to point out monday that lucas had put up hundreds of thousands of dollars into fighting an "anti-puppy mill" ballot measure in missouri that was approved by voters in 2010. "forrest lucas is a peevish advocate of trophy hunting, puppy mills and big agribusiness, and has never met a case of animal exploitation he wouldn’t defend," said michael markarian, president of the humane society legislative fund, which backed the measure in missouri. lucas’ wife, charlotte, who co-founded lucas oil, came under fire in 2014 for a facebook post that criticized muslims and atheists. "i'm sick and tired of minorities running our country!” she wrote, according to news reports at the time. she later apologized. lucas has donated more than $150,000 to a slew of republican candidates and causes since 2006, but records do not show any donations to trump. in an interview last year, lucas did not sound particularly enthused about the new york city real estate mogul. asked if he would be comfortable with trump getting the gop nomination, lucas responded: “it would be like when obama got elected. i’d say, ‘i don’t really like it, but i have no choice and i’ll have to make the best of it.’” a trump campaign spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. lucas could not immediately be reached and his office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. elana schor contributed to this report.      sources: oil executive on trump's short list for interior secretary      
__label__0 senate majority leader mitch mcconnell delayed a procedural vote on a must-pass government spending measure monday as top lawmakers remained at odds over a handful of provisions in the bill, even with a months-long impasse over zika funding largely resolved. the key vote is now scheduled for 2:15 p.m. tuesday, mcconnell said — giving negotiators more time to hammer out the fine print of the continuing resolution that will keep the federal government funded until dec. 9. for now, however, sources said negotiators have settled on language that would provide money to battle the zika virus while allowing planned parenthood’s partner clinic in puerto rico to access the federal grants — a provision that had been a major point of contention. story continued below “senate republicans stand ready to move forward,” mcconnell (r-ky.) said monday. “i would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to complete negotiations so we can advance this important matter.” mcconnell spent about five minutes huddling with senate minority leader harry reid (d-nev.) on monday afternoon as they sought to strike a deal that would allow the senate to recess as soon as the end of the week. but the tentative resolution on zika funding sets aside, for now, one of the toughest sticking points in the short-term spending measure. senate democrats had repeatedly filibustered a standalone zika bill over restrictions that barred planned parenthood — particularly profamilias, the health care provider’s partner in puerto rico — from the federal funds. but in the cr, the puerto rico clinic would have access to the money, which would come through a $95 million social services block grant in a broader $1.1 billion zika package, multiple sources said. language in the emerging deal does not specify which providers are eligible or ineligible for funding, skirting a political landmine that’s delayed zika aid for months. despite the breakthrough on emergency funding for the battle against the mosquito-borne disease, several wrinkles remain in the continuing negotiations. in a brief interview monday morning, reid said “no” when asked whether there would be a deal on government funding later in the day. “close is relative,” reid responded when asked whether an agreement was within reach. for instance, funding for the water crisis in flint, michigan, continues to be in the mix. democrats on both ends of the capitol have lobbied for flint funds to be included in the government spending package, in particular the aid package included in a senate water resources bill. but republicans have similar demands: additional funding for flood-stricken louisiana in the short-term spending measure. both issues remained unresolved as of monday evening, although senior senate democrats suggested they wouldn’t accept flood aid without also getting money for flint. congressional leaders are also still hashing out how to pay for the zika funding package. “louisiana is not resolved because [republicans] want to do louisiana, we want to do flint,” sen. chuck schumer (d-n.y.) told reporters monday evening. “they don’t want to do flint.” another issue that remains up in the air is a potential delay in the obama administration’s proposal to hand over the u.s. government’s authority over the internet domain system to an international body on oct. 1 — a push that’s being led by texas sen. ted cruz and a host of other republican lawmakers. if no deference is paid to cruz and those lawmakers, the spending bill could turn into an internecine fight among republicans — even with some pushback on the provision from democrats. “this is the coordination of the domain names. it’s not who has control of the internet,” florida sen. bill nelson, the top democrat on the committee with jurisdiction over the issue, said monday. “and every institution, nationally and internationally, have all said that this is the appropriate thing to do.” meanwhile, democrats want to include language restoring the ability of the export-import bank to finance projects greater than $10 million — which it hasn’t been able to do because three of the five seats on the bank’s board are vacant. the ex-im issue is similarly toxic among republicans, making it a difficult matter to take up ahead of an election. there are other items that could fill up the senate’s legislative calendar this week before lawmakers return home until the november elections. sens. chris murphy (d-conn.) and rand paul (r-ky.) plan to force a senate vote to block a $1.15 billion arms sale to saudi arabia that the obama administration announced last month. senate majority whip john cornyn (r-texas) said the exact timing of that vote was unclear, particularly because he would like to have the government funding measure resolved before moving on to other issues. cornyn would also like to pair the arms sale vote with a roll call to formally override an expected veto by president barack obama of legislation that would allow family members of victims of the sept. 11, 2001, terrorism attacks to sue the government of saudi arabia. though obama has not yet vetoed the measure, he has until friday to do so. republicans — who are eager to return home to campaign for reelection, particularly with control of the senate in the balance — privately believe democrats will try to drag out the negotiations as long as possible before the sept. 30 deadline to pass government funding. heather caygle contributed to this report.      mcconnell punts budget vote to buy time for deal      
__label__0 hillary clinton on monday leveled some of her most charged attacks against donald trump yet, accusing the nominee of enabling islamic state fighters with his rhetoric and hinting he may be committing treason. with a spate of domestic attacks over the weekend refreshing terror fears, clinton and trump hurled insults at each other on monday, trying to convince voters that the other candidate would be a disastrous commander in chief. story continued below clinton held an impromptu news conference in the morning in which she presented herself as a steady hand in the face of terror threats and trump as a reckless leader who is already making the united states less safe. “we’ve heard that from former cia director michael hayden, who made it a very clear point when he said donald trump is being used as a recruiting sergeant in and for the terrorists,” clinton said. “we know from the former head of the counterterrorism center, mike olsen, that the language that mr. trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries,” she added, using the constitutional definition of treason. trump’s camp fired back, blaming clinton for the rise of the islamic state because she supported pulling back on troops in iraq in 2011. “hillary clinton’s comments today accusing mr. trump of treason are not only beyond the pale, it’s also an attempt to distract from her horrible record on isis,” trump’s senior communications adviser jason miller said. trump himself piled on, trying to shame clinton and tying her to president barack obama on the terrorism issue. “today, hillary clinton showed again that she will say anything — and blame anyone — to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as secretary of state,” trump said in a statement. “the obama-clinton doctrine of not taking isis seriously enough has emboldened terrorists all over the world. they are hoping and praying that hillary clinton becomes president so that they can continue their savagery and murder.” and during an afternoon rally in florida, trump accused clinton of being tougher on his supporters than she has been on terrorists. “hillary talks tougher about my supporters than she does islamic terrorists, right?” he said, to cheers. “she called patriotic americans who support our campaign, many of them cops and soldiers, deplorable and irredeemable, and she means it. millions and millions of people,” trump added, recalling remarks clinton made earlier this month when she lumped half of his supporters into a “basket of deplorables.” the heated language on both sides comes as each are trying to reassure rattled americans that they are the most capable of stepping into the commander in chief role. the series of planted bombs around new york and new jersey over the weekend as well as the mass stabbing at a minnesota mall has freshly raised fears of the reach of the islamic state, even though details are still emerging about the inspiration for the attacks. while clinton tried to present herself as the clearheaded alternative to trump’s reckless bombast, she also had to thread the needle when it comes to her own legacy as secretary of state and obama’s track record. “this is a serious challenge,” clinton told reporters, as she sought to reassure voters that the u.s. is on the right track in combating that challenge. “we are well-equipped to meet it. and we can do so in keeping with smart law enforcement, good intelligence and in concert with our values.” she warned against getting “diverted and distracted” by trump's inflammatory words, and dismissed trump’s attacks on her past efforts to combat terrorism while at the state department. “well, it’s like so much else he says: it’s not grounded in fact. it’s meant to, you know, make some kind of demagogic point,” clinton said. “i am prepared to, ready to actually take on those challenges, not engage in a lot of, you know, irresponsible, reckless rhetoric, but to do the hard work as i’ve done before, to put into place the strategies for local and state law enforcement for an intelligence surge, for the kind of preventive actions we need to take here at home and to intensify our efforts to defeat isis.” clinton also suggested americans won’t hear her opponent’s plan, and not because it's secret. “he keeps saying he has a secret plan. well, the secret is he has no plan,” she said. “so let’s focus on what we really can do, and what i've laid out is a path forward that will keep us safer, protect our country and go after the terrorists to finally destroy them.” but trump was eager to tether clinton to obama, and also pounced on a remark from white house press secretary josh earnest, who referred to the terrorism fight as a “narrative battle” against whether the u.s. and the west is battling against the muslim religion. “i will bring an end to these senseless acts of violence. they are wrong to say that we’re in a fight about ‘narratives.’ these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life,” trump said. trump’s running mate, indiana gov. mike pence, joined in the sniping, saying he was dumbfounded by the white house’s use of the term “narrative fight” and linking clinton to it. “i’m not sure that hillary clinton and barack obama know that we’re at war,” pence told conservative radio host rush limbaugh. “the white house spokesman today actually said that we were in a — quote — narrative fight, in a narrative battle. i don’t even know what that is.” obama, meanwhile, pats himself on the back as he credited the u.s. for exposing the islamic state “as the failed cause that it is” by taking more of its territory.      clinton suggests trump’s rhetoric could be treasonous      
__label__1 early on in tonight’s presidential debate donald trump himself admitted that he was shedding all pretense of reality in his attacks on hillary clinton, replying “why not?” in response to clinton’s sarcastic comment that mr. trump might as well “blame [her] for anything that’s happened ever.” he quickly lived up to his own idiotic remark, most delusionally by claiming that mrs. clinton had been “fighting isis for 30 years” despite the fact that isis has only existed since 2013. in the real world, the islamic state was founded in 2013 and only acquired widespread notice with abu bakr al-baghdadi’s declaration of a caliphate in june of 2014, three and a half years ago. since then, of course, hillary clinton and the rest of the obama administration have worked tirelessly to combat the threat of isis both in the middle east and abroad, and america’s military efforts have resulted in tremendous setbacks for the militant group in terms of both territory lost and fighters killed. so while trump’s suggestion is that clinton has done nothing against isis in thirty years of work, the reality is that she and the obama administration have dealt a tremendous blow to the group in the few years since it was founded. in an attempt to be generous to trump’s lies, it should be noted that the organization currently known as isis grew out of the earlier al-qaeda in mesopotamia (aqam), which was founded in 2004 to fight the american-led invasion and occupation of iraq. so, at best, isis has been around for twelve years, but aqam, in its alliance with the ideologically distinct al-qaeda, was tremendously different than the isis of today. to go back 30 years in the history of jihad would take us to 1986, when various jihadist groups in afghanistan, including those of osama bin laden’s, were being funded and trained by ronald reagan’s cia. it was bill clinton’s administration that first recognized jihadism as a large-scale threat, and his cia amassed a litany of intelligence on al-qaeda, all of which was ignored by the bush administration. trump’s claim that isis has existed for thirty years demonstrates his shocking ignorance of the most basic elements of global politics, and his underlying claim that democrats are “weak” on jihadism is objectively backwards.      trump just said hillary’s been fighting isis her whole life. that’s ridiculous      
__label__1 trump repeated tonight one of his favorite fear-mongering lies: that crime is dangerously out of control in american cities. specifically, he cited chicago – which he emphasized is “obama’s hometown” – as an example of a place plagued by out of control crime. in reality, however, crime rates in all categories have been consistently declining over the past decade and a half – albeit with a recent almost statistically insignificant spike in murder in some select cities. as for chicago, crime – both violent and otherwise – has been consistently declining since about 2001. there has indeed been a spike in homicides over the past few years, but even this year’s exceptional murder count will not exceed the almost 700 murders tallied in the early bush years, much less the almost one thousand annual murders in the 1990s. in fact, the annual murder and violent crime rate in chicago under president obama has been lower than any other time in decades.  the decrease in crime in chicago corresponds with nationwide trends. since the 1990s violent crime in all areas and all categories has declined tremendously. there has indeed been a recent uptick in murders in a few cities but the overall trend remains incontrovertible downward. that’s just the facts. these facts, however, don’t sit well with a demagogic fearmonger like donald trump, who relies on fear and hatred to mobilize his support. in the midst of tonight’s debate trump even deployed the archetypal line of the dictator-to-be: “we need law and order.” and trump is not going to let the facts get in the way of his delusional plots.       trump said “obama’s” chicago’s crime rate has exploded. it’s gone down      
__label__1 hillary clinton just called out the fact that donald trump cheered for the housing crisis in anticipation of its collapse – which is absolutely true. trump told the globe and mail in march of 2007: “people have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and i’m excited if it is. i’ve always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.” in fact, trump thought the housing crisis was much-ado-do about nothing for high-end investments, and told investors: “i don’t see the subprime problems affecting the higher-end stuff…in fact, he is advising investors that there are now great deals in buying subprime mortgages at a discount and repossessed houses at low prices.” of course, on one level, trump wasn’t wrong­­—in that the subprime crisis affected mostly poorer americans who lost their homes and jobs and the ability to support their families. the collapse of home prices caused by the housing bubble cost roughly seven million americans more than $7 trillion in equity during the great recession. this recession most severely impacted low-income folks – people who are burdened with payments in excess of 50 percent of their income – trump’s response is just “that’s called business.”      trump just insulted millions who lost everything in bush’s recession, “that’s just business”      
__label__1 monday evening during the presidential debates, republican presidential candidate donald trump doubled down on his plan to reinstate “stop-and-frisk,” using new york city as an example of how effective it was in in eradicating crime. responding to lester holt assertion that “stop and frisk” was ruled unconstitutional, donald trump said, “no, you’re wrong. it went before a judge who was a very against police judge. it was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. they would have won an appeal.” fact check: stop and frisk is unconstitutional and was neither lawful nor effective. the program, in which police officers arbitrarily decide when to stop and question a pedestrian, then frisk them for weapons and other contraband, was found to be unlawful after evidence provided proved the nypd engaged in patterns of unconstitutional stops that were more likely to affect african-american and latino citizens. the program’s defenders claimed high crime rates were the reason behind the disproportionate targeting of minorities, but jeffrey fagan at columbia law school found after an investigation into the program, that “even if you control for the crime rate, the racial makeup of a precinct is a good predictor of the number of stops” police do in a particular area. “anyone who says we know this is bringing the crime rate down is really making it up,” fagan says. others wouldn’t put it that harshly, but the evidence does seem to suggest that stop and frisk is, at best, ineffective, and, at worst, purposefully targets communities illegally.    examining the number of police stops per seizures of illicit goods mapped out by race, it becomes blatantly obvious that not only are african-americans stopped over 5x more than whites, the disproportionate targeting is ineffective in reducing crime further because it ignores that the numbers suggest there would be more illicit good seizures if police attention was concentrated more appropriately in groups with a lower stop-per-seizure. moreover, as foreign correspondent for nbc news katy tur live-tweeted during the debate, the murder rate in new york city did not drop until after stop-and-frisk was declared unconstitutional and stopped, it also has not risen beyond a level of concern.         trump just said giuliani’s “stop and frisk” worked in nyc. it didn’t      
__label__1 every presidential nominee since 1976 has released their tax returns except for republicans donald trump and gerald ford. debate moderator lester holt put trump on the spot about releasing his returns, and he filibustered, hemmed and hawed intensely, used the old “i’m waiting for an audit to finish” excuse, and then actually dropped a shocking revelation – saying he’s been under audit for 15 years now! – before unleashing a horde of “4 pinocchio” level lies. the irs has confirmed time and time again that there is nothing preventing trump from releasing his returns, and noting that it is very unusual to be under audit for so long, implying that there’s something foul at play. but this hasn’t been just a dodgy situation in this campaign; trump promised to release his returns if president obama released his birth certificate. we all know how that turned out: in 2011, when trump was spearheading the movement questioning whether president obama was born in the united states, trump told abc news that he would release his tax returns if obama released his long-form birth certificate. “i’d love to give my tax returns,” he said. but once obama released his birth certificate, trump hedged. “at the appropriate time i’m going to do it,” he said. the appropriate time never came. it turns out that trump has been under audit for 15 years! it also turns out that the repeated questions about trump’s missing tax returns did yield one revelation from the republican nominee – he tacitly admitted he doesn’t pay income tax, and he thinks that’s great because it makes him “smart” and not greedy. in the end, hillary clinton scored her very best zinger of the night after trump looked like a one armed wall-paper hanger with crabs, trying to cover up a very large wall, with nothing more than shameful lies and promises, and certainly none of his tax papers which the american people deserve to see before voting for this country’s president. hillary clinton has already released over 30 years of taxes, as has her husband former president bill clinton has too. trump: we don't have the money for bridges. hillary: maybe because you're not paying income taxes! #debatenight #debates — grant stern (@grantstern) september 27, 2016  mainstream news took note of the exchange too. hillary said that trump must have something to hide. trump didn’t respond. clinton: no reason to believe trump will ever release tax returns, he must be hiding something #debates pic.twitter.com/irdbw4ubas — cnbc (@cnbc) september 27, 2016       trump said he can’t release his taxes because he’s under audit. he’s lying      
__label__1 democratic president barack obama pulled off a historic diplomatic coup when he engineered an accord with iran to freeze their nuclear program for ten years in exchange for lifting the sanctions that had been strangling their economy. democratic nominee hillary clinton engineered the tough economic sanctions that dragged iran to the negotiating table after ex-vice president dick cheney rebuffed their efforts at negotiation, convincing countries like china and russia to act in unison with the united states and against their own short term business interests. it was a major diplomatic accomplishment and made our world safer. did trump just say us gave iran $150 billion? did i really hear that? — arash karami (@thekarami) september 27, 2016  republican nominee donald trump keeps spewing complete fabrications about the  iran accords which president obama concluded at the start of this year. he started by repeating the lie fox news planted about america paying $400 million dollars of iran’s own cash back to them, at the conclusion of the agreements. it was money america owed iran under a legal agreement. the state department returned $400 million to the iranian government, but it was money that we owed them. we didn’t “give” them anything. in the 1970s, the united states made a deal to sell $400 million of fighter jets to the shah of iran. the shah paid upfront but was then deposed in the iranian revolution, so the united states never delivered the jets. as part of the nuclear disarmament deal, the iranian government simple wanted their money back if we weren’t going to cough up the jets. in trump’s mind, that money inflated to $150 billion. cash to paid to iran as part of the lifting of sanctions rises from $400million to $1.5 billion to $150 billion according to trump. #debates — albert rapacioli (@speedlinefoto) september 27, 2016  bingo! trump's iran cash lie. much debunked. — sarah reese jones (@politicussarah) september 27, 2016  not only has the republican nominee devoted most of his false statements about iran to lying, he thinks it’s a great idea to start a needless war, with a country whose help we need to settle the disastrous syrian civil war. that’s when hillary clinton blew trump out of the water for his empty threats about iran which either look horrifically weak, or are calculated to start a war which would cost americans dearly in blood and treasure, all to satisfy the outsize ego of a republican that no sane voter should choose in november. #debates2016 clinton- trump said he'd blow iran boaters out of water & start another war. trumps casual attitude about nuclear weapons. — susan maylone (@susanmaylone) september 27, 2016  but trump wasn’t content to leave a couple of lies alone, and went all the way out into his own republican echo-chamber to land a ben carson sized fake zinger, claiming that north korea is somehow controlled by iran. which is absurd. trump: “iran has power over north korea.” what? #debates — christina wilkie (@christinawilkie) september 27, 2016       trump said obama gave iran “$150 billion.” he gave them nothing      
__label__1 democratic nominee hillary clinton’s media team went to work tonight on donald trump and the torrent of offensive statements, lies, and delusions that he said during tonight’s debate. cataloging all of the most egregious offenses, it’s a laundry list of reasons – any one of which should be a disqualifier – of why trump would be a catastrophe as the president of the united states. 1.trump mocked former miss universe alicia machado’s weight and heritage, calling her names like “miss housekeeping” and “miss piggy.” huffington post, may 23, 2016 2. donald trump: “pregnancy is never–it’s a wonderful thing for the woman. it’s a wonderful thing for the husband. it’s certainly an inconvenience for a business…and whether people want to say that or not, the fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business.”  5. in the 1970s, trump’s real estate company was sued by the department of justice for discriminating against minority applicants in both new york and virginia–in new york, their applications were marked “c” for colored. the washington post, january 23, 2016 6. trump falsely accused hillary clinton of starting the “birther” rumors about president obama. he promoted the conspiracy for years after his campaign says he “ended” it. 7. trump is wildly misleading when he says violent crime is on the rise. 8. trump claims he’s the “law and order” candidate, but he opposes gun-free zones and supports americans owning assault weapons. 9. part of a history of stiffing his contractors, trump refused to pay an architect what he was owed after designing the clubhouse for one of trump’s golf courses. trump offered just one-sixth the original invoice, and then bullied him with a “take-it or you’ll have to sue me” approach. 10. in the words of his campaign manager, trump “built a lot of his business on the backs of the little guy” and has a history of “not paying contractors after [they have helped him] build something.” 11. trump regularly lies and misleads when it comes to hillary clinton’s emails. 12. trump has repeatedly refused to release his tax returns, breaking a decades-long precedent of transparency for presidential nominees. 13. donald trump said he’s doing “almost 120 deals” outside the u.s., but since he hasn’t released his tax returns we don’t know with who or for what. 14. donald trump is proposing a tax plan with a “trump loophole” that gives the wealthy a backdoor tax cut, establishing a 15% rate for business owners like donald trump. 16. trump’s economic plans will add $5.3 trillion to the national debt, according to a non-partisan analysis. 17. according to a nonpartisan analysis, donald trump’s plans would cost the economy 3.5 million jobs. hillary clinton’s would create 10 million jobs. 19. on libyan intervention: 21. trump said that hillary clinton wants to create “totally open borders,” a claim politifact rated “false.” 22. trump likes to say that hillary clinton is the founder of isis. she’s not. (and neither is barack obama.)      hillary just used trump’s own words to fact-check his debate      
__label__1 republican nominee donald trump got thoroughly outplayed by democratic nominee hillary clinton during the debate tonight, only capable of blustering and babbling in response to her cool and measured fact-based statements. whether it was crime, national security, the economy, trade, or his own tax returns, trump was on the defensive the entire night, unable to overcome the consequences of his own selfish decisions and the weaknesses of the incoherent rambles that pass for policy positions for the republican nominee. immediately after the debate, trump rolled out a pathetic excuse for his own failures tonight.  trump is relentlessly sticking to this ridiculous notion that the system is “rigged” against him, refusing to admit that he’s shot himself in the foot so many times that the vast majority of the american people will be unwilling to support a rabble-rousing racist with an extensive history of shady business practices. not only is it a shameful refusal to admit his own mistakes, but it’s an existential attack on our entire democracy. his mic was clearly not defective, since he continuously interrupted both moderator lester holt and secretary clinton tonight and didn’t back down off from failed attempts to take cheap shots at the democratic nominee. his childish behavior tonight illustrates that he is temperamentally unfit to be the president of the united states, and this pitiful response is just the cherry on the cake.      trump just gave the most pathetic excuse for losing to hillary in debate      
__label__1 bloomberg news reports that the mexican peso grew significantly stronger after democratic nominee hillary clinton’s powerful performance in tonight’s key first presidential debate, after confidently besting republican donald trump. the “invisible hand” of the market is predicting a hillary clinton win after tonight’s debate, and that she’s the only one of the two candidates whose election would keep more jobs in the usa too: the mexican peso rebounded from a record low, a sign investors may perceive hillary clinton outperformed donald trump in the first u.s. presidential debate. the currency rose 2 percent to 19.4879 per dollar as of 1:20 p.m. in tokyo, the biggest gain across more than 140 currencies worldwide, after the debate concluded. around the world, currency traders, the kind-of-by-the-numbers, bottom line capitalists who republicans profess to believe in the most, were unequivocal. they awarded victory in the first 2016 presidential debate to democratic nominee hillary clinton by buying up mexican pesos believing them to be more valuable with a stable diplomatic situation, and by the numbers traders weighed in: “i shall not speculate on whether clinton won or was trumped,” wrote jeffrey halley wrote market strategist at oanda corporation in singapore, “but clearly, the highest [correlated] currency to a trump victory thinks she did!” on a practical level, a stronger peso also means that labor in mexico will get more expensive for american companies as the exchange rate moves when hillary does better in polling. professional currency traders have been betting against the mexican currency for months to insure themselves against an improbable republican victory in november, which would set forth a catastrophe if nafta is unilaterally cancelled, costing millions of americans their jobs to appease trump’s delirious policy dreams. ironically, this means that a trump victory would make outsourcing far more attractive since people would depress the value of mexican pesos, making the cost of hiring even cheaper than today. this also means that a hillary clinton victory in november will make mexico’s currency stronger, which will in turn make it more attractive to our corporations to hire american workers or slow down the rate of outsourcing because of higher labor costs south of the border with a stronger peso. voting for hillary clinton is now economically certain to be better than voting for her lying republican opponent, because his racism would literally be self-defeating, and the “invisible hand of the market” would be best held by a democrat’s steady hand in the oval office come january.       the mexican peso just skyrocketed because of hillary’s dominant performance      
__label__1 donald trump, the supposed “law and order” candidate, painted a very bleak picture of what life in the “inner cities” was like. “we have a situation where we have inner cities, african-americans, hispanics are living in hell because it’s so dangerous” said the republican nominee a few hours earlier. he cited former new york mayor rudy giuliani’s unconstitutional and discriminatory “stop-and-frisk” policy as a solution for crime in urban centers. but his account didn’t match up with the facts, and he was called out by the police department in his own city for his blatant falsehoods and the implication that the nypd isn’t good at their jobs. the assistant commissioner for communication & public information of the nypd, j. peter donald, fact-checked trump during the debate, and has this to say about the racist republican’s proposals to reinstate stop-and-frisk after it was ended by mayor bloomberg in 2011:   trump is trying to position himself as “tough on crime” but the reality is his proposals are nothing but dog-whistles for his racist white supremacist followers. not only was “stop-and-frisk” ineffective, it was very obviously discriminatory against minorities – and after it was ended, crime drastically decreased thanks to new reforms in policing techniques. trump is trying to sell the american people an apocalyptic vision of america that just doesn’t exist – and the policemen whose support he’s courting aren’t buying it either.        furious nypd defiantly live fact-checked trump’s “stop-and-frisk” lies at debate      
__label__1 the first major polls of last night’s debate are out and show a resounding victory for hillary clinton across the board, whose poise, demeanor, and experience shown through in contrast to donald trump, who was repeatedly obnoxious and vapid in his babbling responses.  vox rounded them up, and here’s the results: a poll of debate watchers by cnn/orc, which found that 62 percent thought clinton won and 27 percent thought trump did. cnn’s david chalian emphasized on air that the sample was 10 points more democratic than in a typical poll, but that’s still a strong win for clinton. a poll of debate watchers by public policy polling, which found that 51 percent thought clinton won and 40 percent thought trump won. a focus group of 20 undecided florida voters by cnn found that 18 of them thought clinton won. and a focus group of pennsylvania voters by gop pollster frank luntz overwhelmingly thought clinton had won. libby nelson has more details about that here. that tremendous advantage for clinton is crucial, given that some 50% of likely voters have said that the debates will help inform their decision. facts, experience, and respect clearly matter to the voters, and last night’s debate showed once again that all three are on the side of mrs. clinton.       hillary is destroying trump in post-debate polls (results)      
__label__1 millions of people tuned in monday night to watch coverage of the presidential debate between hilary clinton and trump. going into the debate, election polls were pretty even, but after an incredible display of stamina, hilary clinton came out the clear winner, as reported by almost every media organization broadcasting the debate. following the debate, many public personalities took to twitter to voice their opinion on the biggest political event of the last decade. but few were quite as hilarious and spot-on as former tabloid talk show host jerry springer of the jerry springer show: hillary clinton belongs in the white house. donald trump belongs on my show. — jerry springer (@jerryspringer) september 27, 2016 after years of hosting his colorful daytime drama, jerry springer is arguably the authority on unsavory characters, the criminal underworld, and white trash. and the truth is, jerry springer is right. donald trump is nothing more than a reality tv star who belongs in the tabloids more than he does in our living rooms being considered for president of the most powerful nation in the world. luckily, tonight it really showed. let’s hope america makes the right choice this november.      jerry springer just summed up trump’s debate with the perfect tweet      
__label__1 legendary journalist dan rather took to facebook to give his two cents on tonight’s debate, and his response is a devastating indictment of republican nominee donald trump’s atrocious behavior and obvious inability to stay within the realm of factual reality. praising clinton for maintaining her composure in the face of trump’s aggressive interruptions, he tore into trump for attempting to force our political atmosphere into a post-truth era and for repudiating the noble values of pluralism and tolerance that our nation was founded on. ladies and gentlemen, whatever civility once existed in our politics is tonight officially dead. never in the history of televised debates have we witnessed such a show. and that’s what the donald wanted. a show. he got it, but will he be seen as the hero or the villain? if you are a fan of hillary clinton, i suspect you are thrilled with her poised and confident performance. perhaps her crowning line was “i prepared for this debate and i’m prepared to be president”. if you are a fan of donald trump, his quarrelsome, no-holds-barred approach, often facts be damned, will likely in turn have thrilled you. the question is what does everybody else watching think and how many impressionable voters remain? taking a snapshot of the debate stage this evening, two candidates behind podiums, each representing one of the major political parties, it would seem to be the latest chapter in our quadrennial dance with democracy. but experiencing the event, in sound and motion, it was of course anything but. from the very beginning, the body language tonight was striking. hillary clinton, the first woman ever to be on this stage was calm and substantive. donald trump interrupted often and slouched and sneered as he turned to address her. this is what trump’s fans like about him, playing the alpha male at all costs. clinton seemed completely unflustered, which is what her fans love about her. how this all plays to the majority of viewers and voters at home will be in the eyes of the beholder. but i was surprised by how much this man who has made so much of the means of television spent not looking into the camera, but preoccupied with his adversary. trump came across as amped, a pacing tiger ready to pounce on every answer. his interruptions suggests little regard to the rules. he’s itching for a fight…wants to swing wildly. clinton was clearly the policy expert, nimbly jumping from topic to topic, policy to policy. but she was also much more able to paint a big picture than i have seen in times past. i thought she was particularly effective on the issue of race and especially the birther lie against president obama. she had the facts on her side, but also it was an effective appeal to fire up her base. in the end, more than all of the specifics, i was struck by how unprecedented was the overall tenor – matching that of the campaign. we once held certain truths to be “self-evident” – that “all men are created equal” and “they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” these were the lofty ideals that served as a rallying cry for the founders of these united states to choose liberty over tyranny. the man who wrote these words, thomas jefferson, and his compatriots were imperfect and in some cases deeply flawed men. yet their idealism fixed a north star in our democratic firmament that has guided our ship of state ever since, with some very noted moral detours. now i fear that the tide of progress is rapidly receding with the fierce undertow of a looming tsunami. our founders believed in reason and the power of intellect. donald trump made clear tonight by his wilful ignorance of important issues that he does not. our founders feared the accumulation of power, they loathed vanity, and tried to build in protections against the demagogues who would appeal to mankind’s basest instincts. donald trump relishes in all of these impulses. for him they are instinctual and a prescription for success. to call trump a con man, as many have, is a disservice to the art of the con. by its definition a con requires deceit. but trump has not tried to hide his lies or the sheer unrealistic audacity of his cartoonish policy positions. he has asked the american people to bet on him. the fact checkers will certainly weigh in. the pundits will have their say. but the voters have all the information they need. the judgement is in their – or more accurately our – hands. rather’s words are poetic and nuanced, mixing biting severity with the civilizing admonitions that forged the american journalistic tradition – values that the modern media have abandoned in their ravenous scramble for ratings. we are lucky to have him as a guiding voice during this time of contempt and division. h/t to dan rather.      after debate, dan rather goes viral with damning post about trump      
__label__1 usually, nobody says trump is ready for battle louder than trump’s senior advisor rudy giuliani, but after his candidate suffered a bruising defeat last night at the hands of hillary clinton’s, the histrionic former new york mayor had a different solution for his fact-less republican nominee. giuliani knows that the racist republican nominee cannot possibly win any debate involving facts, so he told nbc what he’d do if possible: “if i were donald trump i wouldn’t participate in another debate unless i was promised that a journalist would act like a journalist and not an incorrect, ignorant fact checker.” that’s right. trump should drop out of the debates because facts are hard. the hill reported specifically that the former prosecutor giuliani was most upset over lester holt’s accurate fact check (that even nypd agreed with) that “stop and frisk,” as practiced under his watch in new york, was definitively declared unconstitutional by a judge: “if journalism has ethics, lester holt unethically interfering in the area of law he knows nothing about,” giuliani said. “it is not unconstitutional and trump’s description of that case was correct.” when the two tangled, it was always about the facts, and each time lester holt stood solely on the sturdiest ground. republicans aren’t enamored with facts, and often try to pretend recorded statements don’t exist, so it wasn’t surprising that giuliani tried to backtrack instantly to nbc. after realizing that he’d just made “spin room” headlines, he said “i did not say what i’m advising, i’m saying what i would do. whatever advice i give to donald trump, i’ll give to donald trump.” lester holt did an acceptable job as moderator last night, upsetting partisans on both sides while managing not to blow any key moments with odd remarks or lasting moments of shame. the republican nominee made several desperate “hail mary throw” sales pitches to the american people last night, but outside of his base it played disastrously.        giuliani just said trump should drop out of debates. his reason is pathetic      
__label__1 hillary clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. the #trumpwon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top trend in the united states. the #1 trend on twitter right now is #trumpwon – thank you! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) september 27, 2016  what’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:  data is from trendsmap.com that’s right- the #trumpwon hashtag originated in st. petersberg, russia, where dictator vladimir putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. it’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten moscow. putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding american social media circles with pro-trump and pro-putin propaganda as the russian state-controlled media promotes trump to their european audiences. putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against russian oligarchs by the obama administration after the russian annexation of crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further russian aggression in eastern europe. the guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.” so remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. it might be a russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.         breaking: putin’s troll army caught rigging twitter to pretend trump won      
__label__1 comedian and actor zach galifianakis recently featured former secretary of state hillary clinton on his improvisational comedy interview show, between two ferns. previously, he’s interviewed president obama as well as other celebrities like brad pitt and justin beiber, but there’s one person he refuses to have on the show. in an interview with the los angeles times, galifianakis was asked if he would have republican nominee donald trump on his show since his interview with clinton was such a resounding success – and his answer is hilarious. “no. that doesn’t interest me. doing it the other way doesn’t interest me. he’s the kind of guy who likes attention – bad attention or good attention. so you’re dealing with a psychosis there that’s a little weird. i wouldn’t have somebody on that’s so mentally challenged. i feel like i’d be taking advantage of him. and you can print that.” between two ferns is known for its exceptionally awkward dialogue and for the host’s fondness for asking uncomfortable questions (he once asked pres. obama “how does it feel to know you’re going to be the last black president?”). part of the joke is both parties attempting to maintain their composure and not rising to the bait. judging from the way that donald trump lashes out like a wounded animal at the slightest provocation and is utterly incapable of letting the pettiest slight go without a response, it’s safe to say that galifinakis is right about how trump would fare on his show. but it’s terrifying to think that a man who couldn’t handle being on a comedy interview show has a real shot at ascending to the presidency of the united states; he has shown time and time again that he is temperamentally unfit for the office.      zach galifianakis just unloaded on “mentally challenged” trump in brutal takedown      
__label__1 turns out the online polls being re-tweeted all over twitter by trump supporters and the presidential candidate himself are not organic, but part of an elaborate campaign created to manipulate the polling and fool the public into thinking that the debate was a trump victory after-the-fact. here’s trump’s tweet with all his fictitious accolades: such a great honor. final debate polls are in – and the movement wins!#americafirst #maga #imwithyouhttps://t.co/3kwol2ibaw pic.twitter.com/sfcee3i5pf — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) september 27, 2016 tuesday morning after the first televised presidential debate, a mysterious #trumpwon hashtag emerged from the russian troll-farms in st. petersberg that started trending along with dubious online polls saying trump had won the debate. the hashtag ran contrary to the popular opinion reflected in every major media news network poll, which showed hilary clinton as the clear winner of the night. even conservative tv network fox news conceded this point when attracting attention to the polls saying, “if polls only included media pundits, hillary clinton would have won monday’s debate by a landslide.” thing is, hilary did win the debate by a landslide, even if the online polls didn’t accurately reflect that. and thanks to the daily dot, we now know the reason why trump won the online polls but literally lost by every other yardstick: it’s because trump supporters cheated. the effort to create a false narrative of a trump debate victory began by recruiting members of the pro-trump reddit community r/the_donald and 4chan message boards, affecting somewhere around 70 polls, including polls by time, fortune, and cnbc. the r/the_donald community has over 200,000 subscribers, and with its numbers it made short work of online polls susceptible to bots, vote brigading, and other forms of manipulation that make these online survey results extremely dubious.  this latest instance of foul play from the trump campaign tells us the length to which trump supporters will go to get their candidate elected, especially if they see it as their only recourse. luckily nothing could be done for donald, because his loss was so dramatically obvious, that tampering with the polls wasn’t enough to hide the glaring fact that he lost. let’s hope that next november, manipulating online polls won’t be enough to stop the critical mass of reasonable voters who don’t want to elect a megalomaniac.      busted: huge ring of trump fans caught rigging online debate polls      
__label__1 the senate on tuesday failed to pass a short-term spending bill to keep the government funded as mitch mcconnell and other republicans insisted on keeping corporate political funding hidden from voters and denying aid to the beleaguered residents of flint, mi. senators have been working in recent days on hammering out a short-term funding bill known as a continuing resolution that would fund the government until december 9 at the least. absent such an agreement, the federal government will run out of money and shut down in three days on october 1. the intransigence of senate republicans on the issues of corporate financing and aid to flint, however, have prevented the bill from passing as the senate shot down a gop continuing resolution today by a 55-45 vote. the first sticking point is a rider that senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has insisted on adding to the bill and which would block the securities and exchange committee (sec) from requiring publicly-traded corporations to disclose their political spending. ever since the citizens united decision of 2010, corporate donors have been able to make unlimited political donations without disclosing any information on their political spending to the public. this has led to an unprecedented influx of corporate and big donor money in american elections – close to $700 million so far this year – and has served republicans and their big-money donors quite well. so well, in fact, that senate republicans are willing to sacrifice the functioning of the government itself just to be able to keep the nefarious sources of their campaign financing secret and please the oligarchs who pull their strings. clashes have also arisen over republican refusal to include in the bill aid to the city of flint, mi, which is still suffering from the effects of a neoconservative-engineered lead poisoning crisis. the bill already includes flood aid for flood victims in maryland, west virginia, and louisiana, and democrats have requested that aid for the victims of the water crisis in flint be included as well. republicans, however, have refused to add this money, and have come up with a variety of facetious justifications for their indifference to the sufferings of poor african-americans, from claiming that the flint crisis is a local issue to deciding that the flint aid should be included in the separate water resources development act (wrda) instead. the problem with that excuse is that democrats have already tried to pass the flint aid through wrda but came up against the same wall of republican intransigence and indifference there. the senate successfully passed a version of the wrda earlier this year that included more than $220 million in aid and infrastructure improvements for flint. paul ryan and his band of extremist republicans in the house, however, stripped the flint aid provision from the house version of the wrda, and the discrepancy between the bills would have to be settled in conference committee negotiations after the november election, and the dominance of hardline republicans in the house makes it very unlikely that such a settlement would include aid to flint. so, once again, republicans, for whom compromise and good governance seem to be alien concepts, are sending the federal government hurtling down the path to shutdown for absolutely no good reason. the issues underlying this most recent case of intransigence, however, demonstrate more clearly than ever the degree to which many republicans have ceased to serve the people they are elected to protect and instead devote all of their efforts to aiding their corporate sponsors. if the health and livelihood of this nation’s oppressed minorities have to be sacrificed in the process, these republicans won’t bat an eye.      breaking: republicans move to shut down government for a sick reason      
__label__1 s trump’s number one backer in silicon valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. the u.s. department of labor filed suit charging that palantir technologies, the palo alto technology company controlled by republican businessman peter thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. palantir is a federal government contractor to the nsa. sources say that donald trump wants to deliver a lifetime supreme court nomination to thiel, who despises the first amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. both the stanford law school grad thiel and trump’s campaign later denied the report. vanity fair noted that: according to the lawsuit, palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were asian. ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four asians and 17 non-asians. “the likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says. ironically, peter thiel, the trump donor who bloomberg called the republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. thiel’s parents came to america to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether. thiel was a paypal co-founder and early facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. the billionaire revealed himself in march to be hulk hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation. but now, the entire world knows mr. thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the republican national convention in cleveland. thiel then called out the gop’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “every american has a unique identity. i’m proud to be gay, i’m proud to be a republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” he became the first ever openly gay speaker at the rnc to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period. unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-lgbt platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the bush administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s. “federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the department of labor’s ofccp director patricia shiu. “our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” lisa gordon, a spokeswoman for palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to bloomberg news. now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.       just in: trump supreme court pick sued by feds for racial discrimination      
__label__1 the first debate showdown of republican nominee donald trump and democratic nominee hillary clinton was expected to be a brutal altercation between the two candidates. instead, the viewing audience was treated to a one-sided destruction with clinton appearing cool and presidential, while trump gave the worst debate performance in presidential history. each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support, and clinton invited billionaire mark cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against trump in the media. there is no love lost between the two businessmen, and cuban even said of trump there was “no bigger jagoff in the world.” the indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of cuban to being in debt at least $600 million. the shameless trump, who became more unhinged as the night progressed, freely gave away one of his biggest secrets — that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years. clinton speculated about this, and like a predictable rube under the hot lights trump cracked under the pressure. rather than offer an explanation or deflection to clinton’s hypothesis trump agreed he paid no taxes and said, “that makes me smart.” trump’s cheap explanation sounded like something a third grader on the playground would offer rather than a presidential candidate. an hour after the debate trump immediately began walking back his statement, and denied he had ever said it. this type of shamelessness is difficult to combat. when asked , “it sounds like you admitted you haven’t paid federal taxes and that was smart. is that what you meant to say?” trump replied, “no, i didn’t say that at all.” trump insulted every american who pays their fair share of taxes and cuban was not amused nor impressed. after the debate cuban said: i get audited every year my taxes are — it takes me 45 minutes just to sign all the different taxes that i have to spend. and i tell my tax lawyers and everybody, you know, take advantage of — do what the law recommends. but i’m not against paying taxes. and i’ll give you a perfect example. when the dallas mavericks were building a new practice facility which was just opening i had the opportunity to go to dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything. i didn’t do it. a couple years ago we had some issues in dallas, i just wrote a check to the general treasury. this year we had, after the shootings in orlando, i had concerns about the lgbt community in dallas. i just wrote a million dollar check to the city of dallas to support a bunch of different programs. i’m, i’m the luckiest guy in the world. there’s nobody who’s been as blessed as me and my family, so far, knock on wood, is healthy, and at some point you have to realize you have to give back. and you have to realize that this is a country that’s been great to us. and you can’t just take, take, take, take, take, take. .@mcuban on trump saying not paying taxes makes him smart #debatenight pic.twitter.com/upnunatukv — stefan becket (@becket) september 27, 2016 the contrast between cuban and trump could not be more stark. cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him, while admitting he owes his success to society. trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible, while offering to pay back nothing. did trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes? no. did trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes? no. trump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent, because if they did they would certainly not support him. trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made chinese goods to which his name is affixed. in trump’s world there is a two-tiered system. one for him, and one for everyone else.      trump said not paying taxes makes him “smart.” mark cuban’s response is powerful

__label__1 the archconservative arizona republic newspaper in phoenix has endorsed democratic nominee hillary clinton, less than 24 hours after the conclusion of the first presidential debate. if there were questions this summer that arizona has become a swing state, this surprising answer puts a must win state for republicans – which has been solidly red since becoming a state – into play for democrats in 2016. arizona’s largest media outlet has never picked a democrat for president since 1890. not only did the republic endorse clinton because trump is unfit for office, but their 1400 word endorsement is lengthy, absolutely comprehensive, filled with videos and even rejects the republican embrace of racist immigration politics for the democratic party’s inclusive recipes to move america forward: the arizona republic endorses hillary clinton for president. america needs to look ahead and build a new era of prosperity for the working class. this is hillary clinton’s opportunity. she can reach out to those who feel left behind. she can make it clear that america sees them and will address their concerns. she can move us beyond rancor and incivility. as secretary of state, clinton made gender equality a priority for u.s. foreign policy. this is an extension of clinton’s bold “women’s rights are human rights” speech in 1995. it reflects an understanding that america’s commitment to human rights is a critically needed beacon in today’s troubled world. clinton retains her composure under pressure. she’s tough. she doesn’t back down. trump responds to criticism with the petulance of verbal spit wads. that’s beneath our national dignity. when the president of the united states speaks, the world expects substance. not a blistering tweet. in fact, the arizona republic published such a lengthy editorial board statement that it’s easier to summarize their section headers, because these eight points made by the conservative newspaper answer many of the media’s lingering questions about both candidates. the republic reserved its harshest criticism for trump’s misadventure to mexico city, then paired with an immigration speech in phoenix. the republican’s gamble failed, and the trip to our southern neighbor mushroomed into an international incident, spurring legislation which will prevent mexico from ever paying for a border wall. even worse for trump, the arizona republic’s unequivocal slam dunk of his mindless harsh immigration policies is a massive failure in the border state whose notorious sheriff joe arpaio is the most racist lawman in america. phoenix has voted the racist birther – who refuses to give up the witch hunt of president obama like trump claimed he would – into office since 1993, and it’s a place who prefers the most extreme solutions to immigration and loves racial profiling in law enforcement. the republic roundly condemned republican tropes demonizing latinos in general and mexicans in particular: contrast clinton’s tenacity and professionalism with trump, who began his campaign with gross generalities about mexico and mexicans as criminals and rapists. these were careless slaps at a valued trading partner and arizona’s neighbor. they were thoughtless insults about people whose labor and energy enrich our country. trump demonstrated his clumsiness on the world stage by making nice with mexican president enrique peña nieto only a few hours before appearing in phoenix to deliver yet another rant about mexican immigrants and border walls. what’s more, arizona went down the hardline immigration road trump travels. it led our state to sb 1070, the 2010 “show me your papers” law that earned arizona international condemnation and did nothing to resolve real problems with undocumented immigration. arizona understands that we don’t need a repeat of that divisive, unproductive fiasco on the national level. a recent poll shows arizonans oppose both more walls and the mass deportations trump endorses. we need a president who can broker solutions. there’s just a certain segment of american voters who will never ever change their minds based on facts, and so they’ll continue to vote trump. but independent and undecided voters can trust the numerous factual reasons issued from sources like the arizona republic, who have no incentive to be nice to hillary clinton or institutional preference for democrats. if hillary clinton can win over so many republicans with her leadership qualities and competent preparation for the job of president, the choice to vote for the democratic nominee for america’s independent voters should be clear this november.      arizona’s top newspaper just endorsed a democrat for first time in 126-year history      
__label__0 despite not making it to the first debate stage, both parts of the libertarian ticket agree they are "going to alter the course of this election whether or not we're in the debates." last week, it was determined that libertarian candidate gary johnson and green party candidate jill stein did not make the cut for the first presidential debate, which will be held sept. 26. despite that, on sunday in an interview that aired on "60 minutes," johnson and running mate william weld agreed with interviewer steve kroft that their ticket still has the ability to make an impact. story continued below johnson said 70 percent of america do not know either him or weld. at the end of the day, the former new mexico governor said the libertarian ticket is taking votes from both democratic nominee hillary clinton and republican nominee donald trump. "this is both sides, man, this is both barrels," johnson said on the cbs news program. "i'm not going to lose one minute of sleep ruining this two party monopoly that is going on. i think they are dinosaurs and i think we're the comet in this whole equation. i'm glad for it." for his part, weld said he thought their ticket would hurt trump more. "i think at the end of the day, it would be most likely trump than clinton," the former massachusetts's governor said. johnson also acknowledged his recent gaffe, where he could not identify what the syrian city of aleppo was. he said there is no quicker way to fix mistakes than acknowledging them in the first place. "i am human, i have a filter, it starts with honesty, it starts with the truth. when i was asked the question, the first thing that came to my mind is this is an acronym," johnson said. "you know so many people have said 90 percent of american doesn't know aleppo, well 90 percent of america is not running for president of the united states. no excuse, no excuse."      libertarian candidates: we will alter course of the election

__label__0 the united states made at least two separate payments to the iranian government via wire transfer within the last 14 months, a treasury department spokesman confirmed saturday, contradicting explanations from president barack obama that such payments were impossible. responding to questions at an aug. 4 press conference about a $400 million payment delivered in cash to the iranian government, obama said, “[t]he reason that we had to give them cash is precisely because we are so strict in maintaining sanctions and we do not have a banking relationship with iran that we couldn't send them a check and we could not wire the money.” story continued below but a treasury department spokesman acknowledged on saturday that on at least two occasions, the u.s. did make payments to the iranian government via wire transfer. in july 2015, the same month in which the u.s., iran and other countries announced a landmark nuclear agreement, the u.s. government paid the islamic republic approximately $848,000. that payment settled a claim over architectural drawings and fossils that are now housed in the tehran museum of contemporary art and iran’s ministry of environment, respectively. then, in april 2016, the u.s. wired iran approximately $9 million to remove 32 metric tons of its heavy water, which is used to produce plutonium and can aid in the making of nuclear weapons. while some sanctions relating to iran’s nuclear program were lifted with the implementation of the nuclear agreement, others imposed over the islamic republic’s human rights policies and support for terrorist organizations remain in effect. the july 2015 wire transfer was made while the full weight of sanctions against iran were intact, while the april 2016 payment for heavy water was made after the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions. the treasury department spokesman explained that the lifting of those sanctions allowed iran “to gain incremental access to the international financial system, which opened up more options for executing transactions, such as the heavy water transaction” that occurred in april 2016. the spokesman declined to offer an explanation as to why the july 2015 payment was possible despite the full array of sanctions in place at the time. that $400 million cash payment that obama said could not have been delivered any other way was part of a larger $1.7 billion settlement with iran, the remainder of which was also delivered in cash. the $400 million, paid in january to settle a decades-old dispute over military equipment order by the late shah of iran, was sent through intermediary central banks in europe, who then delivered pallets of euros, swiss francs and other currencies to tehran. the treasury department spokesman said that the january settlement specified that payment be made in cash because iran had previously had difficulty accessing wire-transferred funds and was “very aware of the difficulties it would face in accessing and using the funds from the january 2016 settlement payment if they were in any other form than cash.” a senior obama administration official contested that the treasury department’s confirmation of the twin wire transfers contradicted what the president said at his press conference early last month. the official repeated what the president said at the time, that “we do not have a direct banking relationship with iran, which means that we cannot wire money directly to iran,” but did not directly address either the july 2015 or april 2016 wire transfers. “sanctions had effectively cut off iran from the international financial system and after several years of trying to gain limited access to its own money held in accounts outside of iran, iran was very aware of the difficulties it would face in accessing and using these funds if they were in any form other than cash,” the official said of negotiations surrounding the $1.7 billion settlement. “therefore, effectuating the payment in foreign currency banknotes was the most reliable way to ensure that they would receive the funds in a timely manner.” republicans in congress and on the campaign trail have alleged that iran requested a cash payment specifically because it would make the money difficult to trace. gop presidential nominee donald trump made an issue of the cash payment over the summer, suggesting that the cash delivery likely wound up funding terrorism or found its way into "some of the mullahs' bank accounts." sen. james lankford (r-okla.), who discovered the two wire transfer payments in briefings with obama administration officials, echoed those concerns in an interview with politico on thursday. “oh, i don’t have any question that iran wants the money in cash because they wanted it faster than what a wire transfer would be and it’s fungible,” lankford said. “they announced pretty quickly afterward that they were expanding their defense and their military budget by $1.7 billion dollars, an exact amount that we had just sent over to them. so i don’t think that was accidental.” “but when you give cash, we can’t track,” he continued. “did that go to hezbollah? did that go to the russians? did that go to the coup in yemen? there’s no way to be able to track that.” republicans, including lankford, have also suggested that the $1.7 billion delivery constituted a “ransom” payment because it was delivered on the same day that u.s. prisoners were released by iran. the president dismissed such claims during his aug. 4 press conference as “the manufacturing of outrage” and said unequivocally, "we don’t pay ransom for hostages.” but state department spokesman john kirby acknowledged two weeks later that the u.s. had refused to deliver the cash to iran until its prisoners were wheels up from tehran, a decision kirby said the u.s. made to “retain maximum leverage” over the iranians. despite that admission, he maintained that the arrangement did not in any way constitute a ransom payment.      u.s. wire payments to iran undercut obama      
__label__0 jill stein is a harvard-trained internist, a doctor who diagnosed thousands of patients for a quarter-century in boston and chicago before making the late-career switch to green party presidential candidate and could-be hillary clinton spoiler. so, as we settled in for our “off message” podcast interview last week in a drab hotel conference room in baltimore (she had a rally there last friday), i asked stein — as a clinician used to making snap assessments — whether she agreed that donald trump “will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,” as declared by the gop nominee’s bruce vilanch-esque personal physician harold bornstein. story continued below “you know, i don’t pretend to be able to do tv diagnosis, but i think the guy has a problem,” said the 66-year-old candidate, who is averaging somewhere between 2 percent and 5 percent in most national and state polls, enough (clinton people say) to put a scare into the democrat in too-close-to-call states. “the guy has a lot of problems — physical, mental, emotional, cognitive,” stein said of trump. as proof of his (alleged) pathology, she pointed to his position-hopping on a range of issues, which she cast as erratic rather than calculating — from his fuzzy iraq positions over the years, to his brief “softening” on immigration last month, to his decision (on the day we spoke) to suddenly renounce birtherism after five years of banging a drumbeat of lies. “it’s hard to, you know, to think too hard about anything donald trump says because he will change his mind in the next hour, if not the next day, or whatever,” she added. “today, suddenly, after five years, he became convinced that it’s not an issue. yesterday it was an issue. it will probably become an issue again for him. you know, the guy may have a memory problem. who knows what it is? but he’s incapable of having a consistent thought or policy.” stein also thinks trump’s getting a free pass because he spent his career in private business, and she wants him to release his tax returns. (she wants everybody else to do the same.) “at least with clinton, you know, there was some degree of transparency,” she said. “but what’s going on with trump, you can’t even get at, and what he said was that even to clarify 15 out of these 500 deals, these are just like the most frightening mafiosos around the world. he’s like — he’s a magnet for crime and extortion.” a veteran protester who has had brushes with the law, stein has a bit of carrie nation ferocity about her, but she also has a soothing, therapeutic mien — precisely the person you’d go to if you developed an unexplained rash after chaining yourself to a fracking facility. stein got 460,000 votes as an outsider candidate in 2012 for a left-of-left, anti-war party steeped in environmental issues, but adamantly denies any role as a spoiler. she won’t say whether she can better ralph nader’s 2.7 million total for the party in 2000 and generally avoids the whole al gore-florida-handing-w-the-white house thing. and she claims that she’s drawing disaffected bernie-or-bust voters who never, ever would have voted for clinton anyway — many of whom might have actually voted for trump. (i told her i don’t buy that.) as much as stein despises trump — and she really, really does — she describes the choice between him and hillary clinton as an abominable binary offering “death by gunshot or death by strangulation.” but her contempt has a more cutting quality when she talks about clinton. she mocks trump as braying menace; stein thinks he’s, at heart, a bumbler who would be neutered by his own party after being elected. but it’s clinton who poses the greater threat, in stein’s estimation, because she knows how to move the levers of washington. “donald trump, i think, will have a lot of trouble moving things through congress,” stein explains. “hillary clinton, on the other hand, won’t. … hillary has the potential to do a whole lot more damage, get us into more wars faster, to pass her fracking disastrous climate program, much more easily than donald trump could do his.” this is a boutique opinion among mainstream liberals, to put it politely. and a lot of people, democrats and pollsters among them, see in stein and her more popular libertarian counterpart gary johnson (whose support flirts with double digits) as potent threats to clinton because they draw disproportionately from her potential supporters, especially among younger voters. the tbs host and satirist samantha bee, who makes no secret about wanting to see the first female president elected, is so infuriated with stein she refuses to even show her picture on tv — and encouraged stein backers to mail their complaints to her vagina, though she used a different word. stein is used to this kind of thing and believes she is taking one for the lefty team. earlier this year, she hinted about dropping out if sanders stayed in and still pines a bit for the hillary-backing vermont socialist. “i’ve tried to talk with bernie, but, you know, bernie is — he is a team player,” she said, lamenting his refusal to even chat with her. “i think he’s on the wrong team, perhaps because he’s been in washington, d.c., too long, because he used to really understand independent politics and why we cannot have a viable political system unless we have independent political parties. … maybe it’s a generational thing.” sanders, stumping for clinton over the weekend, dismissed stein and johnson as a self-defeating “protest vote” but there’s more than a little truth to her argument that third-party candidates will lure voters away from the democratic nominee, with some polls showing a quarter to a third of under-30 voters opting for stein, johnson or none of the above. “the millennial problem is real,” a senior clinton aide recently told me. “it shouldn’t be overstated, but we have work to do.” like sanders, stein has an affection for russia and a soft spot for botox strongman vladimir putin. critics like clinton ally neera tanden have noted just how often stein appears on the putin-controlled cable network rt. and a gushing video stein recorded after her appearance at a democracy conference in moscow earlier this year sparked all sorts of speculation on the part of team clinton about a broader cyrillic conspiracy to undermine the democratic nominee that included trump, his former aide paul manafort and hillary-hating wikileaks founder julian assange, whom stein has spoken about in heroic terms. when i asked her whether putin is a despot, i got a yes-and-no answer, with traces of trumpian ambivalence. “to some extent, yes, but there could be a whole lot worse,” stein said when i asked about the reportedly rigged russian elections this year. “when we needlessly provoke him and endanger him and surround him with war games — this is sort of the cuban missile crisis on steroids … and i don’t think this is a good idea.” moreover, she doesn’t think russia was behind the hacking of the democratic national committee email system or that putin is trying to sway the election in trump’s favor — despite u.s. officials’ claims to the contrary and media reports that the russian president is hell-bent on seeing clinton defeated. “i don’t think we have evidence — there is really no hard evidence” of putin’s meddling, she said. “we need to take a deep breath on this. this really doesn’t seem to be happening.” the other controversy ensnaring stein is questions over her commitment to vaccinations, after comments she made earlier this year expressing sharp skepticism about the food and drug administration and its willingness to buck corporate interests to produce safe formulations. on this topic she is less equivocal, and says she sees zero link between autism and vaccinations, although she remains concerned about the developmental impact of chemicals included in shots given to small children. stein is extremely fastidious about her health (she sipped on an organic berry smoothie before our talk) and is acutely conscious of the environment, and not only in the abstract sense. at one point during our chat, after a bout of coughing, she pointed to the well-worn hotel carpet and told me the chemicals used to cover up the dirt are so toxic she spreads sheets on the floor every time she’s in a big-chain hotel. she is an ex-marathoner who clears her email inbox every morning during a brisk six-mile walk and has no detectable body fat. thus, it is one of the small jokes in a big-joke 2016 that both stein and johnson are ultra-buff exercise freaks who are in far better shape than the puffier major-party candidates. as we were discussing trump and clinton’s dueling doctor’s notes, she offered the following declaration: “i am healthy, yes. i assume i have the lowest blood pressure of any candidate,” she said running a long finger down the medical office-type clipboard, stuffed with clips and talking points, that she totes everywhere. cool. trust but verify. clinton provided her numbers — could she produce hers? “last i recall it was around 110/70,” stein said. “i’m sorry. hillary clinton has a 100/70,” i said. a few minutes into the podcast, an aide had handed stein a note informing her she had (as expected) been locked out of the debates, and she responded with a smiling shrug. the blood-pressure revelation elicited a graver response. “are you serious?” stein said, pausing — before offering clinton a challenge. “man. … well, i would be happy to run a race with her anytime.”      jill stein: trump may have 'memory problem'      
__label__0 donald trump has unleashed an unprecedented deluge of small-dollar donations for the gop, one that republican party elders have dreamed about finding for much of the past decade as they’ve watched a succession of democrats — barack obama, bernie sanders and, to a lesser extent, hillary clinton — develop formidable fundraising operations $5, $10 and $20 at a time. trump has been actively soliciting cash for only a few months, but when he reveals his campaign’s financials later this week they will show he has crushed the total haul from small-dollar donors to the past two republican nominees, john mccain and mitt romney — during the entirety of their campaigns. story continued below all told, trump is approaching, or may have already passed, $100 million from donors who have given $200 or less, according to an analysis of available federal election commission filings, the campaign’s public statements and people familiar with his fundraising operation. it is a threshold no other republican has ever achieved in a single campaign. and trump has done so less than three months after signing his first email solicitation for donors on june 21 — a staggering speed to collect such a vast sum. “i’ve never seen anything like this,” said a senior republican operative who has worked closely with the campaign’s small-dollar fundraising operation. “he’s the republican obama in terms of online fundraising.” clinton counted 2.3 million donors as of the end of august, the result of decades of campaigning, a previous presidential bid and allies who painstakingly built her an email file of supporters even before she formally announced her second run. but trump had zoomed to 2.1 million donors in the past three months alone, his campaign has said. the question now is what the gusher means for the gop. the republican national committee, through a deal struck with trump in may, is getting 20 percent of the proceeds from its small-donor operation for trump plus access to this invaluable new donor and email file. but can trump’s candidacy help close the republican party’s small-donor divide in one fell swoop? will these donors — 2.1 million and counting — give to other republicans? will they drag the republican party in trump’s direction for years to come? or, if he loses, will they simply vanish? “the challenge is that we still have a divided party,” said mindy finn, who led romney’s digital team in 2008 and worked for george w. bush’s reelection in 2004. trump has found record-setting success as the first republican nominee “in the internet age” to have made empowering the grass roots and railing against the elite a core of his campaign message, finn said. going forward, the key will be whether his donors can be convinced to give to a candidate with just a bit less bombast. “can you be a populist without being a barnburner?” she asked. “and thus still be able to raise this kind of money?” or, as a second operative who has worked with trump’s small-dollar fundraising operation, put it, “i don’t know how much these trump donors — if he doesn’t win — want to give to the rnc.” trump, a self-proclaimed billionaire who bragged during the primaries about how he didn’t need anyone else’s cash to run for president, would appear at first to be the unlikeliest of republican fundraising heroes. but the combination of his celebrity, anti-establishment populism, and running against clinton has led to a windfall, even as his skeletal campaign did little for more than a year to cultivate a donor list or build digital infrastructure to lure contributors. “people are pouring in, and we’re having to manage the inflow,” said one of the operatives familiar with the trump operation. it is impossible to piece together a complete picture of trump’s finances due to different reporting deadlines for trump’s various committees. but as of the end of july, he had amassed $50 million in small contributions into his campaign, fec records show. he has since announced he raised $90 million in august “mostly” from small donors both directly for his campaign and in joint committees shared with the republican national committee — suggesting at least $45 million raised last month came from small contributors. additionally, there is some money from small contributors in those shared rnc accounts — trump said they contained $37 million at the end of july — that he has helped raise. trump’s success dwarfs those of his gop predecessors. mccain and romney, in 2008 and 2012, respectively, raised just less than $64 million in contributions of $200 or less, according to fec records (mccain, notably, accepted public funds in the 2008 general election). trump still lags far behind the pace-setting democrats. president obama raised an enormous $483.6 million in contributions of $200 or less in 2012, fec records show. sanders raised almost $202 million in small donations just during the 2016 primary. and clinton raised almost $156 million in such contributions through the end of july, according to the fec. democrats seem to vacillate between comforting themselves with all that trump continues to do wrong — botching mike pence’s announcement, the high spam rate on their first email, the volume of ads targeting democrats — and concern about his successes in spite of that. “i would just put it in the perspective of they’re still not doing as well as they should be doing, and they’re doing too little too late,” said kenneth pennington, who served as digital director for sanders. “once they start copying some of the things democrats are doing, then i’ll get worried.” trump is certainly spending big to raise small money. in july, he poured $8.4 million into his san antonio-based digital firm, giles-parscale, most of which was spent on online advertising and prospecting for donors. people familiar with the trump operation say that the campaign has essentially told digital vendors that it will run as many facebook and google ads as possible, so long as investing in the particular ad is generating positive cash flow, or return on investment. “we’ve had a positive roi on everything,” said one trump campaign official. brad parscale, who runs the trump digital operation and began working for the trump family before it entered politics, has increasingly begun traveling to new york and accumulating power within the campaign. last week, donald trump jr. visited parscale’s operation in san antonio to thank the employees, and rnc officials, dispatched there. “every time there’s been a change in leadership, he’s gotten significantly more authority,” an operative who has worked with the campaign said of parscale. of course, the ever-increasing flow of money to trump tower has certainly helped. on aug. 31, the day trump went to mexico and the last day of the reporting period that will be revealed this week, trump raised an enormous $5 million. the campaign ran a dizzying 107,000 different ad combinations on facebook on that day alone, according to lindsay walters, a republican national committee spokeswoman, swapping out different text, graphics and videos to determine what performed strongest. a typical day involves 40,000 to 50,000 such combinations, walters said. another person familiar with the trump and rnc digital operation said there has been some strain simply creating content fast enough to fill all the ad slots that are making them money. in an atypical arrangement for a presidential campaign, the rnc is actually taking a cut of all the small-dollar fundraising done through its joint committee with trump (romney received 100 percent of the joint committee’s small donations, in contrast). the agreement was struck back in may, when trump emerged as the nominee with little infrastructure or experience to execute a large-scale digital operation. as a result, the rnc will end 2016 will access to a far larger email and donor file than ever before. “a lot of them probably don’t realize that 20 percent of the money goes to the rnc; otherwise they probably wouldn’t give,” said one of the operatives who has worked with trump and the rnc. “people are giving money to the joint fundraising committee because donald trump’s name is on it.” indeed, almost all of the ads prominently incorporate trump’s image or name — offering dinner with trump, coffee with ivanka trump, lunch with eric trump. and the appeals aren’t just for petty cash. trump has run an extensive email campaign asking for $184 for signed copies of “the art of the deal” — an unusually large sum to seek online. “we wouldn’t be running all that stuff if it wasn’t working,” said a person who has worked with the campaign. in a sign of the potency of trump’s name, others are trying to capitalize as well. the national republican senatorial committee, the campaign arm of senate republicans, has been blitzing its own email list with trump-themed missives. so far in september, the nrsc has offered trump-pence yard signs, bumper stickers, bracelets, magnets and t-shirts, even as strategists have urged senate candidates themselves to distance themselves from trump on the trail. other, insurgent-style republicans have found success among small donors in the past. ben carson’s primary campaign floundered but he still raised $48 million among those who gave $200 or less. ted cruz raised more than $60 million from such givers before he dropped out. that is the catch-22 for a republican establishment that, thanks to trump, is now awash in a potentially powerful list of new givers — the energy and money is for the anti-establishment candidates. fred malek, a top republican presidential fundraiser for decades, said trump’s singular appeal to small donors could be just that. “it seems to me that it is not necessarily transferrable,” he said.      trump shatters gop records with small donors      
__label__0 with just 50 days until the election, donald trump is facing a staggering — and perhaps historic — organizational disadvantage. according to a politico review of campaign spending, hillary clinton has invested seven times the amount of money on tv commercials as her republican rival and has established twice as many field offices in many of the states that will decide who wins the presidency. in many battlegrounds, she has dozens more organizers than trump. story continued below while trump, a first-time politician who has surrounded himself with advisers who are new to the rigors of presidential campaigns, has made serious headway in a number of battlegrounds in recent days, his on-the-ground and in-the-air deficits could be what stands between him and 270 electoral votes. “we’re in completely untested waters,” said david kochel, an iowa-based republican operative who is leading a study group at the harvard institute of politics contrasting the traditional campaign approach adopted by clinton with the non-traditional one being used by trump. “there has never been such a wide disparity in resource allocation as we're seeing in 2016.” the question, though, may be whether trump’s lack of infrastructure matters in an election cycle that has so far rewarded a low-budget approach built on free media and mass rallies rather than tv ads and door-knocking. last week, smart media group, a media buying firm that works with the republican national committee, sent an email to a group of top trump advisers, including campaign manager kellyanne conway, tv ad maker larry weitzner, and senior communications adviser jason miller, briefing them on the latest in commercial spending. the numbers were startling. as of sept. 12, the email noted, trump had spent $17 million on tv ads, a small fraction of the $126 million clinton had invested. when outside groups were added to the mix, trump’s deficit was even greater -- $33 million to clinton’s $244 million. trump aides say the figures reflect a simple reality: their funds are limited. through the end of july, clinton and her outside group allies had raised a combined $435 million to trump’s $160 million – a difference of more than two-to-one, according to the center for responsive politics. unlike clinton, a powerful fundraiser, trump has struggled to attract the support of deep-pocketed donors, many of whom have been repelled by his candidacy. those working for pro-trump super pacs are racing to find a solution. advisers to one of the groups, rebuilding america now, are openly discussing the possibility that rick scott, the wealthy florida governor who is chairing the super pac, may soon provide it with a contribution. clinton has used her tv barrage to cast her republican opponent as a dangerous, unpredictable figure who’s ill-suited suited to occupy the oval office. last week, while trump aired commercials in just four states, clinton had spots running in nine battlegrounds. one clinton ad that went into heavy rotation, titled “sacrifice,” spotlighted critical comments trump made about arizona sen. john mccain’s war record. strategists from both parties say they cannot recall the last time a presidential nominee has been so dominated on the tv airwaves. the seven-to-one ratio confronting trump far eclipses the five-to-four margin president barack obama faced in 2012 and the two-to-one ratio mccain encountered in 2008. with early voting in some battlegrounds opening in just days, the race is entering its most intense phase yet. and while clinton has established formidable operations in many key states, trump has far fewer full-time staffers to get out the vote, according to figures provided by campaign aides, national party officials, and swing-state operatives. in must-win ohio, where early voting begins on oct. 12, clinton has around 250 organizers and 50 offices. trump, meanwhile, has roughly 110 staffers and 30 offices. republicans say gov. john kasich’s persistent refusal to endorse trump has hurt the nominee, depriving him of man-power. many of kasich’s longest-serving aides, including jeffrey polesovsky and jai chabria, have decided to sit on the sidelines. chabria, a former kasich senior adviser, said trump was behind in a state where appealing to low-propensity voters was a weeks-long process that couldn’t be done overnight. “it’s a very late effort by the trump folks to play catch up, and the democrats and the clinton campaign have been here for a long time. that’s going to have an effect,” he said. “big rallies are really nice, but actual campaigns matter in ohio.” in north carolina, where trump has around 170 staffers and 10 offices, clinton has over 250 workers and 30 offices. democrats say they are implementing a detailed plan aimed at intensifying turnout among black and college-educated voters, demographic groups that trump has struggled with. last month, clinton brought aboard dan kanninen, who played a key role in barack obama’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns, to help oversee her campaign in the state. in new hampshire, it’s a similar story. while trump has fewer than 50 full-time organizers and just a handful of offices, clinton has around 100 staffers and 25 offices. “two months out, i think hillary has a stronger operation than trump up here. that’s pretty apparent from the number of staff, the number of offices, and the number commercials,” said jim merrill, a veteran republican strategist who oversaw marco rubio’s primary bid in new hampshire and held similar positions on mitt romney’s two presidential campaigns. “trump is behind where we were in 2012.” in even conservative bastions, clinton is developing formidable infrastructure. in arizona, clinton has around 160 staffers and 25 offices, and in georgia she has roughly 40 organizers and 10 offices. in that state, tracey lewis, who worked on michelle nunn's 2014 georgia senate bid, recently signed on as a senior advisor. republicans declined to detail their numbers in the two conservative states but acknowledged that clinton had a bigger field presence. while trump advisers concede they’re behind in the ground war, they insist they’re making serious gains. the campaign, for example, said it had improved its footing in florida after engineering a recent staff shuffle. state director karen giorno, who’d clashed with many members of the trump team, was replaced with susie wiles, a former top adviser to scott, the florida governor. yet in an election that’s so far been driven by daily headlines, some are wondering if textbook campaign metrics like tv ads and field staffers will matter as much as they have in previous years. some are coming to the conclusion that the new york businessman’s lack of swing-state infrastructure might not be fatal. throughout his campaign, trump has invested relatively little on tv ads and field deployment – instead surviving off his ability to pack rallies and generate overwhelming media attention for speeches and statements large and small. on thursday morning, during a meeting convened by trump’s congressional supporters on capitol hill, conway said the republican nominee would give multiple addresses each week focusing on specific policies he’d implement as president. “the fact that the numbers have moved gradually in trump’s favor in spite of the onslaught of spending by hillary causes a lot of head-scratching,” said kochel, who was chief strategist on jeb bush’s presidential campaign. “but the voters are getting their information in a thousand different ways outside of the campaigns’ control.”      50-day countdown begins      
__label__0 new york – all politics is geopolitical in this year's presidential race -- and top democrats and republicans fear that will reshape america’s relationships around the world no matter who wins. this week, the uncertain state of those relationships will be on full display in new york as the united nations general assembly gathers and the presidential contenders stage meetings meant to project which alliances they favor and which expertise they want to claim. story continued below on monday, hillary clinton will meet with ukrainian president petro poroshenko—a clear dig at the developing partnership between vladimir putin and donald trump. she’ll also sit with japanese prime minister shinzo abe, her campaign announced sunday night, rejecting the suggestion that her opponent is better positioned to guide the global economy or to counter the rise of china and north korea while reminding americans of donald trump’s suggestion that america should pull its support from japan and south korea. clinton and trump both have scheduled meetings with egyptian president abdel fattah el-sisi—an american ally, though one with dictatorial tendencies. the democratic nominee set hers up first, aiming to project to voters that she’s up-to-speed on counter-terrorism and other issues roiling the region. trump’s came second and was an attempt by sisi to ensure even dealings, according to egypt’s state news agency. nonetheless it might offer the republican nominee a chance to frame up a position on middle east issues that goes beyond simply banning muslim immigrants from america. keeping presidential politics domestic has long been more stated tradition than reality: israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu not so subtly telegraphed support for mitt romney four years ago and obama’s summer 2008 foreign tour was built around a 200,000-person rally in berlin that was projected to voters at home that they should catch up to the forward-looking europeans and support the upstart young senator. but none of this compares to the degree to which this year’s race is defined by global affairs – the result of the first former secretary of state in 200 years to be nominated for president and the challenges trump has made throughout his campaign to fundamentals of american foreign policy. clinton is already planning, if elected, to concentrate on convincing foreign capitals that trump and the number of votes he gets in november isn’t a sign that they need to be worried about america turning away from them. “she’s very concerned,” said a clinton aide. “there’s no doubt that when you have a major presidential candidacy saying what he’s said, it has an effect on foreign policy.” certainly, presidential politics simply no longer stops at the water’s edge, and this year, it has lapped aggressively, perhaps dangerously, over america’s borders. “it will have lasting impact,” said sen. ben cardin (d-md.), the ranking member on the foreign relations committee “it has been changed,” agreed rep. peter king (r-n.y.), a former chairman of the homeland security committee and a trump supporter. “it gets a little bit risky when you try to bring foreign support into it.” there has been a long list of international never-befores in 2016, including trump’s decision to accept an invitation from mexico’s president and then commandeer a joint press conference at the presidential palace to declare america’s sovereign right to build a wall separating the two countries. and that’s hardly all. there was the alleged russian-led hacking of democratic campaign committees to dump emails and other information through wikileaks, trump operatives pulling tougher language about the invasion of crimea from the gop party platform, italian prime minister matteo renzi saying he’s personally rooting for clinton, vice president joe biden saying trump doesn’t “understand” nato on a trip to latvia last month, president barack obama getting asked by foreign leaders for a year to weigh in on the presidential election. and just friday, london mayor sadiq khan, speaking in chicago, accused trump of “playing into the hands” of isil. officials openly wonder what clinton’s approach as president would be now to mexican president enrique peña nieto, or how quickly and forcefully nato would restructure if trump wins. what if china or russia or north korea moves to test the new president right after inauguration day? what if an international economic or humanitarian crisis erupts? while many in washington’s diplomatic community say they have a clearer sense of how clinton, as opposed to trump, would want to respond, doubts are growing that either would be able to summon the national resolve to do. her meetings this week are about twisting the knife politically on trump, the aide acknowledged, but they’re also about thinking through what being on the job on jan. 20 might entail. take poroshenko, who is rebuking putin just by being in office: “it’s impossible not to read politics into it somewhat, but because of the way trump’s been talking over the course of the campaign, secretary clinton thinks it’s important from a policy standpoint,” the aide said. if trump wins, he’ll have to quickly confront leaders around the world who would be shocked that u.s. voters had elected him, and afraid that he would ushering in a new and dangerous world order. “they will certainly want to see where we’re coming from,” king said. “he will have to clarify and make it clear where he’s coming from.” if clinton wins, she’ll have a clean-up that cardin and others compare to the repair mission obama first gave her as secretary of state after the global souring on george w. bush. cardin, who’s firmly behind clinton, ran through a litany: sitting in harare earlier in the year, watching zimbabwean president robert mugabe laughing as the conversation turned from his own human rights abuses to trump’s success, the conversations with leaders in bilateral meetings who quickly ditching the old diplomatic decorum to start griping, drinks afterward with officials who are even blunter. “can you imagine if trump were president and we’re trying to get a coalition against isil and we need to get the support of moderate sunni states, and we need to do things that are perhaps against their local popular position? can you imagine what donald trump’s comments about muslims coming to america would have on a leader of a moderate muslim state?” cardin said. “it’s that type of problems that have now been caused.” this has all made for tricky travels for obama, as he’s spent significant time abroad this year nailing down his foreign policy legacy as president as the campaign has intensified. being abroad doesn’t stop people from asking for his take on trump and the race, whether in closed bilateral meetings or at press conferences. obama tends to draw his own line for where to stop himself, but critics and even occasionally his own aides can feel like he goes too far. “it's not a mystery to people overseas that democrats and republicans in the united states have their differences,” said a senior administration official. “so that's why leaders traveling overseas don't make as much of an effort to conceal it.” from the beginning of his presidency, obama saw himself as embodying a generational shift in the world order, from shifting more of the burden in the middle east to arab nations to the kind of interlocking international effort that put sanctions on putin and brought the iranians to the nuclear negotiating table, to reopening cuba. he’ll make that case and the case for going forward in his own speech to the u.n. general assembly tuesday morning. but the argument is going to be largely defined by who his successor is. trump didn’t run his mexico trip by the white house. clinton didn’t run her meetings this week by the white house either. “we’re having a serious debate,” said ivo daalder, now the president of the chicago council on global affairs, and obama’s first u.s. permanent representative to nato. “we’re going to live with the consequences and the impact of the debate.”      america's relationships are on the line — no matter who wins      
__label__1 nba legend and fearless columnist kareem abdul-jabbar just debunked the central pillar of the trump campaign of fear, racism and religious intolerance as un-american fearmongering with a historical parallel every by one america’s greatest presidents which each and every democratic voter needs to know: most americans are familiar with franklin delano roosevelt’s famous 1933 “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself” inaugural address. but the full quote was an even starker warning: “let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself — nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.” fear, roosevelt said, causes us to retreat from our duty rather than advance our causes. this year, we are in danger of retreating from building the america we’re all supposed to be proud of, one that protects all and offers equal opportunity to all. the fact that the fear that sends some of us scuttling away is “unreasoning” and “unjustified” makes us cowards. cowards abandon principles at the first sign of danger and look for witches to burn — or foreigners to blame. if there’s one stunning thing about the 2016 general election, it’s the total abandonment of the american experiment by the republican party in exchange for the mindless rhetoric of terror and obedience. normal american politicians ask people to put their faith in our country and its institutions, but trump told the republican convention this year that he alone could solve america’s problems – which is the boldest, least believable, total gospel to his supporters. trump’s fearmongering on national television starting last year, coincided with a rapid escalation in hate crimes against muslims over their religious freedom according to abdul-jabbar. in fact, 2015 was the worst year to be muslim in america since 2001, which university researchers in california speculatively attribute to the “trump effect.” however, kareem abdul-jabbar isn’t just one of the nba’s legends, nor is he just a columnist whose clarity of insight and strength of voice continues to grow as he opines on the american experience. kareem is a peer of donald trump who grew up in new york city at the same time, but with regular parents and without the trappings of lots of cash, a rich daddy and enough taxpayer subsidy cash to build a sports arena. that’s why he nailed something essential about the republican nominee’s fragile psyche: trump’s method for convincing people to go along with doing what they know is fundamentally anti-american — and just plain evil — involves scaring voters with a constant barrage of lies and exaggerations. the fact that this propaganda is so effective is especially sad, because the nation that once stood up to bullies like hitler, castro and khrushchev is now falling into goose-step behind a home-grown bully who seems afraid of everything that isn’t part of his entitled life, who responds to his irrational fears the way a child does. kareem called out trump’s fearmongering for what it truly is, the reaction of a child who never truly became a man above the shoulders. the republican never had to grow up, to sink or swim, to stumble and fall and keep working until you make it or not. when donald trump plunged his casinos into what would be their first of many bankruptcies, he was put on an allowance by the banks. let that sink in – a 40-year-old person, purportedly a grown up, who needs to be kept on an allowance. who paid that allowance? the many big banks trump claims to despise today. worse, they delivered trump a reward for failure was after he’d wrecked the fortunes of not only his investors, but also the many small business people who never got paid for building his maniacal taj majal. trump ultimately wrecked atlantic city itself, whose casino industry never recovered from trump’s foolishly ego driven business plans that all of his contemporaries derided as lunacy. trump can only sell fear, because under the suit, under the fancy airplane, which he wouldn’t have today without daddy’s money and connections, under it all, he’s only got the emotional maturity of a spoiled child. a spoiled child who in the finest republican tradition like george w. bush before him has always failed upwards. now, trump wants  to bring back the last failed republican regime’s worst ideas in spades, along with racism, openly visceral discrimination and a new kind of fear america has never seen. after 9/11 the bush administration openly used fear to manipulate the public and government policy to help their cronies. trump wants to use the same fear mongering, but without any actual problems happening. shamefully, too many americans are ready to buy into this new republic of fear, but as kareem abdul jabbar concluded: “compassion and courage are what makes america great, not hate and fear.”      kareem abdul-jabbar calls out “coward” trump in brutal op-ed      
__label__1 hillary clinton proposed on thursday a new series of progressive taxes that would raise rates on the nation’s ultra-rich. the most significant of her new proposals calls for raising the top estate tax rate to 65% from the current 40%, a move that would generate about $260 billion in new government revenue over the next decade. clinton had already proposed raising the rate on some millionaires to 45%, but her new plan, drawing heavily on that of her social democratic primary challenger sen. bernie sanders (d-vt), would be even more progressive. three new estate tax brackets would be added under the new system: a 50% rate for couples with estates valued over $10 million, a 55% rate for couples with estates valued over $50 million, and a 65% rate for couples with estates valued over $1 billion. although the trump campaign predictably railed against an “even higher hike in the death tax,” only an infinitesimal number of incredibly wealthy americans would be affected by the new rates. according to irs data only 223 estates with taxable value over $50 million filed estate tax claims in 2014, and there are fewer than 1,000 people in the entire country who would ever be subjected to the highest rate. this very minimal burden on a tiny number of families that are more than able to shoulder it would pay for clinton’s proposed simplification of small business taxes and expansion of the child tax credit, programs that will millions of americans. while cynical republican demagogues have painted the estate tax as an oppressive punishment for small businesses, couples with less than $5.5 million in assets – or 99.8% of the nation – pay no estate tax at all. the rhetorical acrobatics and outright lies required to convince the average american that they are at risk from the so-called “death tax” is astounding. in reality, clinton’s proposed hikes would actually lessen the tax burden on small businesses by financing a simplification of the business tax code. all in all, clinton’s tax proposals would generate about $1.5 trillion in new revenue over the next decade, with the vast majority of the burden falling on the super-rich. donald trump, in contrast, has called for eliminating the estate tax entirely and slashing taxes by $12 trillion over the next decade, a move that most reasonable economists agree would cause a severe recession and eliminate a staggering 3.5 million jobs. the clinton campaign reportedly collaborated with sen. sanders’ former economic advisers to produce the new estate tax plan, and indeed it is almost identical to sanders’ primary proposal. today’s announcement was thus one of the most concrete examples of clinton’s shifting leftward in an attempt to win over skeptical progressives who supported sanders in the primary. sanders himself praised the proposal and released a statement endorsing it, saying that “secretary clinton understands that it is appropriate to ask the top three-tenths of 1%, the very wealthiest people in this country, to pay their fair share of taxes so that we can provide a child tax credit for millions of working families and lower taxes for small businesses.”      trump furious as hillary reveals huge tax hike for billionaires      
__label__1 republican presidential nominee donald trump’s campaign is in shambles and he is doing his best to soak the government for as much money as possible before he is humiliated at the ballot box by democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton. trump’s latest escapade has been to swindle $1.6 million from the u.s. secret service for the honor and privilege of protecting him, according to fec filings. the secret service has a policy of reimbursing the campaigns of presidential candidates for the costs incurred due to various agents traveling with the candidate. typically a campaign will pay for the airfare of the secret service, and the campaign is then reimbursed those funds. however, trump has found a way to make a profit through this policy by chartering planes to the secret service owned by, tag air, inc, one of his companies. therefore, the secret service – and the american taxpayer- are literally paying trump. this is in sharp contrast to hillary clinton’s campaign which has been chartering planes through executive fliteways, to which clinton has no financial dealings or hopes of personal reimbursement. one’s imagination does not require a stretch to see the outrage amongst fanatical trump supporters if clinton were profiting from her travel, but selective outrage is their stock and trade. trump’s campaign says there is nothing illegal about what they’ve done. a spokeswoman of trump’s campaign, hope hicks, said, “everything was done in accordance with fec guidelines and regulations. please direct further questions to usss.” along with secret service payments, trump may also be soaking news organizations for the costs of journalists traveling with his campaign for the same reasons. it is also possible the secret service has been forced to pay trump when their agents sleep in his grotesque golden hotels, as trump stays at his own properties whenever possible. this is likely because he enjoys sleeping on the cheapest chinese made beds money can buy.      outrage: trump makes $1.8 million in profit from taxpayer-funded secret service      
__label__1 the senate reconvened this week as democrats introduced a transparency in presidential candidates bill that would force donald trump to release his tax returns, if republicans would only be willing to face everything their racist nominee has done in his business career: democrats are backing legislation from sen. ron wyden (d-ore.) that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving the party’s nomination. it would also require the fec would release the documents after 30 days, if a candidate did not. “we’re going to be here next week. we’re probably going to have some downtime,” sen.chris murphy (d-conn.) told reporters. “there’s no reason we couldn’t vote.” democratic candidate hillary clinton and her husband the former president bill clinton have both disclosed over 30 years worth of tax returns, and all of the clinton foundation’s returns too. in fact, since 1976 only one candidate has refused to release tax returns, and in that election republican gerald ford kept his taxes secret, and left the oval office after losing to democrat jimmy carter. in the 2012 election, democratic senate leader harry reid voraciously and publicly called out republican nominee mitt romney for only releasing two years of tax returns, saying that he was hiding his returns for over a decade and that the candidate had paid a very low or no tax on his income whatsoever. he was right! but america only found out just one week before the election, long after the start of early voting and absentee ballot mailing, when bloomberg news published a definitive article on romney’s taxes, which showed a huge income and no tax paid, validating the democrat’s numerous public statements. according to the hill: minority leader harry reid (d-nev.), who has called out the gop presidential nominee nearly every day recently, added thursday that trump is “ethically compromised” and the “king of the welfare kings.” ironically, romney’s father george romney was a republican candidate for president before him, and started the tradition of american politicians disclosing their financial details when running to become commander in chief. american voters deserve to know what’s inside republican nominee donald trump’s tax returns, to make the most informed votes possible. because we all know every last detail about democratic nominee hillary clinton’s finances and personal history, but outside of lying, racism and narcissistic self-love, the orange-faced one is still a mystery.      senate dems move to force trump to release his tax returns      
__label__1 supporters of republican presidential nominee donald trump were not pleased when rina shah appeared on fox news for independent presidential candidate evan mcmullin last friday, september 16, 2016. and one of them left a hateful, racist voice mail for her at mcmullin’s campaign office. ms. shah and the mcmullin campaign turned this awful-tasting lemon into lemonade – in the form of a campaign ad. evan mcmullin was a republican. at the beginning of august, he announced his independent candidacy for president as an alternative to republican nominee donald trump. rina shah is a political and media consultant who joined mcmullin’s campaign staff as communications director in mid-august 2016. shah was born in west virginia to indian american parents.  she has been a commentator on the pbs program “to the contrary” and she founded rilax strategies, a political consulting firm. shah said to buzzfeed that this wasn’t the first time she’s received such messages: “i could send you, i’m not kidding, hundreds of emails i’ve received … you know, ‘you’re a muslim,’ ‘you’re a c-u-n-t’ — i get a lot of, ‘go back to your country.’” the caller identified himself only as “alan.” buzzfeed tracked him down and learned that his name is alan pryce. once the transcript of the message was read to him, pryce claimed it and said he: “…stands by every word.”   mr. pryce seems to have the same loose relationship with the truth as the candidate he supports. he did not know, for example, that ms. shah was born in the united states. his reaction: “really? well, she’s absolutely a first-gen whatever. look, i didn’t do a biography on her.” he continued: “clearly, she’s an anti-american supporter of a pathological, lying criminal. anyone who supports [hillary clinton], either actively or tacitly, is anti-american scum in my mind.” buzzfeed reported that pryce says he was disabled by an undocumented immigrant. he would not give any details, so buzzfeed could not confirm his story. pryce had some choice words for mcmullin, too (“cuckservative,” which is straight from the alt-right‘s racist playbook). but he doesn’t mind at all being part of the mcmullin campaign’s ad. he thinks it’s “hysterical.” watch the ad with alan’s message, but be warned that it’s language is quite graphic:  featured image: screenshot via youtube video.      rabid trump supporter leaves racist voicemail for mcmullin, candidate turns it into campaign ad (video)      
__label__1 republican nominee donald trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of vladimir putin, the dictator of the russian federation. he’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by russian state-controlled media and by russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of democratic party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord. throughout all of this, trump has insisted that he has no business ties to russia. “for the record, i have zero investments in russia” he tweeted in july. now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time. an abc news investigation has found that donald trump has “numerous ties” to russian interests both here in the united states and in russia. “the level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with russian businessmen. they were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with donald trump. and they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with donald trump” says sergei millian, who heads a u.s.-russia business group. trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 miss universe contest in moscow and selling trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of russian buyers – so many that the sunny and hollywood islands in florida became known as “little moscow.” the oligarchs of russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former soviet union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. towards the end of the boris yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all russian finance. now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion. the oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing trump properties was a favored way to do so. it makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. they are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth. “i think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. they spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…they don’t read books. they don’t go to [art] exhibitions. they think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former kgb agent alexander lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” sound like anyone we know? when the us state department leveled sanctions on the russian oligarchs in 2014 following moscow’s annexation of the crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. if trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and trump himself. “we’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said trump on the issue of sanctions in july. these business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential president and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the russian oligarchs and put a check on russian territorial aggression in eastern europe. would president trump be able to put his personal profits aside? if this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that trump cares about nothing but himself. we cannot allow him and his russian cronies to take their corruption to the white house. watch abc news’ report here:       bombshell: abc reveals trump paid “hundreds of millions” by russian oligarchs      
__label__1 a new video has emerged of the moments before and after police officers gunned down keith lamont scott in north carolina a few days ago. but the video, filmed by scott’s wife rakeyia, does not show the exact shooting and still leaves many questions unanswered. the police video of the shooting has been seen by his mourning relatives. “when told by police to exit his vehicle, mr. scott did so in a very calm, nonaggressive manner. while police did give him several commands, he did not aggressively approach them or raise his hands at members of law enforcement at any time. mr. scott’s hands were by his side, and he was slowly walking backwards” said family attorney justin bamberg. a picture has emerged that purports to show that scott had a gun but it is still unclear who it belonged to or if it is a gun at all. in any case, north carolina is an open-carry state with loose firearm laws, which more often than not seem to apply only to white people. in the video, the cops keep yelling “drop the gun” while rakeyia scott keeps telling them that he doesn’t, and that what he does have is a traumatic brain injury and that he just took his medicine. “don’t shoot him. don’t shoot him. he has no weapon. he has no weapon. don’t shoot him!” she pleads as officers yell – in an extremely unprofessional fashion – “drop the f*cking gun!” why the officers were in a standoff with scott at all is still unclear, as they were there to serve a warrant on someone else. but as happens far too often in the united states, scott was executed without charges or trial. protests by angry citizens demanding the release of the tapes continued into a third night as the governor declared a state of emergency and imposed a midnight to 6 am curfew. police have continued to refuse to release the tapes as their “investigation” continues. watch the video here. viewer discretion is advised, as it is very disturbing and contains profane language:       breaking: keith lamont’s wife releases video of his shooting by police      
__label__1 new jersey’s despised republican governor chris christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the george washington bridge in order to punish a political rival. christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “bridgegate” scandal by a judge, as wnyc reports: the decision on impeachment will be up to democratic speaker vincent prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the assembly judiciary committee would begin the process.it takes a majority of the 80-member assembly to vote articles of impeachment. if it passes the democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. although democrats hold a majority in the senate, they would need three republican senators to join them if all democrats vote to convict. chris christie is also republican presidential’s nominee donald trump’s transition team chairperson. just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the governor, accusing christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the george washington bridge to new york city, which resulted in the death of one person  in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world’s busiest bridges. governor christie was trump’s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major “conservative” republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on trump’s benefaction. going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing trump last march in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the governor. famously, chris christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. it’s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the republican governor’s the flat out denial of any knowledge of bridgegate which he gave on january 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. bridegate literally gridlocked an entire town. last week it was revealed that governor christie was actually informed personally about bridgegate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages. the republican governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration’s bare knuckle political bullying. we will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of republican nominee donald trump the impeachment charges christie is facing, because the new jersey governor is one of the pillars of this year’s republican presidential campaign. watch his shame:       breaking: new jersey moves to impeach chris christie over “bridgegate”      
__label__1 in an interview with rolling stone, rock legend and american icon bruce springsteen ripped republican nominee donald trump for undermining the integrity of our democracy and for unleashing the undercurrents of white supremacy into mainstream american politics. when asked what his thoughts on the trump phenomenon were, he gave this nuanced and eloquent response: well, you know, the republic is under siege by a moron, basically. the whole thing is tragic. without overstating it, it’s a tragedy for our democracy. when you start talking about elections being rigged, you’re pushing people beyond democratic governance. and it’s a very, very dangerous thing to do. once you let those genies out of the bottle, they don’t go back in so easy, if they go back in at all. the ideas he’s moving to the mainstream are all very dangerous ideas – white nationalism and the alt-right movement. the outrageous things that he’s done – not immediately disavowing david duke? these are things that are obviously beyond the pale for any previous political candidate. it would sink your candidacy immediately. i believe that there’s a price being paid for not addressing the real cost of the deindustrialization and globalization that has occurred in the united states for the past 35, 40 years and how it’s deeply affected people’s lives and deeply hurt people to where they want someone who says they have a solution. and trump’s thing is simple answers to very complex problems. fallacious answers to very complex problems. and that can be very appealing. it is indeed a tragedy for our democracy. the most important part of democratic governance is ensuring the public believes that our politicians are held in check by the will of the people – and the behavior of the republican party over the past eight years has been to erode that confidence in our electoral system through their efforts gain unfair advantage by repressing the votes of minorities and gerrymandering districts to ensure their political security. at the same time, their single-minded devotion to increasing the political power of the monied elites and funneling the wealth of the american people to the top 1% has greatly exacerbated the costs of deindustrialization/globalization, while studiously denying the existence of those costs in the first place. donald trump is the epitome of that excess, the wealthy man who has spent his entire life exploiting and extorting his way to wealth who has now turned to cheap ethnonationalist scapegoating as a way of shifting the blame for the economic frustrations of the working class off of predatory capitalists like himself and onto minority groups. “the boss” also gave a resounding endorsement of democratic nominee hillary clinton, saying that he thinks she would be a “a very, very good president.” springsteen’s words remind us all of what’s at stake in this election, and why it’s so critical that we defeat donald trump at the ballot box this november.      rolling stone asked springsteen his opinion of trump. he didn’t hold back      
__label__1 during a republican primary debate in september 2015, now-republican nominee donald trump said that he never lobbied florida governor jeb bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if i wanted it.” but if that is true, then donald trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as newsweek reports: one of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. but unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to trump’s mendacity is on full display: he makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost. assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. even though bush’s story reinforced what trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. instead, he looked america in the eye and lied. and then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: his people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in florida, regardless of bush’s opposition—if trump had wanted it. the transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which jeb bush would’ve full well known, as would have trump. because after trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into florida over the objections of an anti-gambling republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. eichenwald’s point is that either trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or: now consider the other option, that trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. there, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by fields. the rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect. why is all of this important? in the late 1990s, house republicans impeached democratic president bill clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. the entire media hounded president clinton over the whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find. republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a florida court of law under oath (it does seem like trump lives in the florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head. trump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for president. see for yourself the two transcripts newsweek published and decide for yourself if trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the republican debate audience. compare the two options presented by eichenwald, there’s no third option here: bush: “the one guy that had some special interests that i know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was donald trump. he wanted casino gambling in florida.” trump interrupted bush: trump: i didn’t— bush: yes, you did. trump: totally false. bush: you wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because i was opposed to— trump: i would have gotten it. bush: casino gambling before— trump: i promise, i would have gotten it. bush: during and after. i’m not going to be bought by anybody. trump: i promise, if i wanted it, i would have gotten it. bush: no way. believe me. trump: i know my people. bush: not even possible. trump: i know my people. transcript of 2007 trial deposition: a lawyer asked trump, “did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” trump: a little bit. lawyer: what did you do? trump: i actually spoke with governor-elect bush; i had a big fundraiser for governor-elect bush…and i think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in trump tower in new york on fifth avenue. lawyer: when was that? trump: sometime prior to his election. lawyer: you knew that governor bush, jeb bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in florida, didn’t you? trump: i thought that he could be convinced otherwise. lawyer: but you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you?

__label__1 a police officer in louisiana fighting murder charges in the death of a 6-year-old boy with autism is pleading self-defense, saying he feared for his life. in late 2015, norris greenhouse, jr., 24, and lt. derrick stafford, 32, of the marksville, louisiana police department, opened fire on christopher few’s car while his young son, jeremy mardis, was strapped in the front seat. while few survived the injuries sustained from the gunshots, mardis was killed at the scene. because few was backing his car toward the officers, attorneys representing stafford say his indictments for second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder should be dropped as he was in fear for his life. “a review of the indictment by the court would show that the state does not state any allegations of fact that would satisfy the essential element of specific intent for the offenses charged whereby trier of fact could support a conviction,” stafford’s attorneys wrote to the court. in body camera video of the shooting, which has still not been publicly released after nearly a year, prosecutors with the louisiana attorney general’s office say greenhouse and stafford fired on few’s car from a “safe distance,” even while few had his hands in the air in a plea to stop the officers from firing on his vehicle. this isn’t stafford’s first brush with criminal charges. in 2011, he was charged with raping two women in rapides parish — an 18-year-old girl, and a 16-year-old girl on her birthday. the charges were dropped in 2012. both stafford and greenhouse are facing separate trials for their charges. stafford will stand trial on november 28, and greenhouse’s trial is scheduled for march 2017. louisiana state district judge william bennett will hear stafford’s argument to quash the indictment next wednesday.              cop charged with murdering autistic 6-year-old boy claims self defense      
__label__1 a few days ago, donald trump’s despicable spawn tweeted out a meme comparing refugees fleeing chlorine gas and napalm in syria to “poisoned skittles,” implying that allowing them to resettle in the united states would lead to increased terrorist attacks. donald trump jr’s meme is referencing an idea with a long history in white supremacist and neo-nazi thinking and is nothing but a heartless islamophobic attack against innocent people fleeing an unimaginable hell on earth. over the past week, hundreds have perished as syrian dictator bashar al-assad and his russian allies rain hellfire upon the city of alepp. over half a million have perished in syria’s civil war. hundreds of thousands of people in cities across syria are starving, trapped in besieged cities with no way to get fresh food. hospitals, markets, schools are bombed indiscriminately. rebel-held areas are dominated by jihadi groups that institute harsh religious law; in regime areas, tens of thousands vanish into the depths of assad’s prisons to be raped, tortured, and eventually killed. the people of syria need our help. the conflict is of our making thanks to george w. bush’s invasion of iraq; our refusal to hold the assad regime accountable for his crimes means we contribute to the slaughter being perpetrated every day. comedian eli bosnick gave an incredibly powerful explanation for just why the skittles meme is so offensive – and how we should really feel about accepting refugees.  that’s what real courage looks like. that is how a real american, a real human, should feel.      donald trump jr. compared refugees to skittles. this comedian’s response is perfect      
__label__1 this friday, the trump camp released a new list of ten more potential judges that he would consider to fill the vacant seat on the supreme court. this list includes a former law clerk to justice samuel alito, senator mike lee (r-ut). lee believes that federal child labor laws, medicare and social security are all unconstitutional and is arguably the most conservative member of the united states senate. the list gave us new reasons to fear the presidential candidate, by giving us insight into the legislative agenda the donald will push if elected president. the list was tailored to appease hard line conservatives and skeptics, containing candidates from the whole spectrum of the right, from judges who believe the less the judicial branch intervenes the better, to those that want to get rid of the minimum wage and fundamental labor legislation guaranteeing basic protections. mike lee, in a statement, said he appreciated being considered. “right now i’m focused on my job in the senate, where i’m in a good position to defend the constitution by fighting against government overreach. both lists that i’ve seen from the trump campaign are fantastic.” in 2010 senator mike lee described his interpretation of the constitution in detail in a since-deleted youtube video. in a segment of the video, lee calls attention to the “toughness” of the decision in hammer v. dagenhardt, which challenged a federal law abolishing child labor by asserting child labor laws ought to be within the power of the state instead of federal jurisdiction. congress decided it wanted to prohibit [child labor], so it passed a law — no more child labor. the supreme court heard a challenge to that and the supreme court decided a case in 1918 called hammer v. dagenhardt. in that case, the supreme court acknowledged something very interesting — that, as reprehensible as child labor is, and as much as it ought to be abandoned — that’s something that has to be done by state legislators, not by members of congress. […] this may sound harsh, but it was designed to be that way. it was designed to be a little bit harsh. lee uses this separation of powers argument as his defense for a number of other “tough,” radical right ideas about peeling back federal powers. that’s because lee is part of a movement whose members are convinced new deal-era reformers plotted to “illegally” exploit depression-born desperation and expand the federal government’s powers. people within this movement interpret the 10th amendment of the constitution as explicitly prohibiting spending programs and regulations disfavored by conservatives. programs such as social security, medicare, medicaid, and the affordable care act are illegal in the eyes of people like mike lee, borrowing ideologically from the john birch society and the libertarian party platform of 1980, which demanded that we live in a completely darwinistic, plutocratic, and privatized world where there is no taxation, no safety nets of any kind, and political strings are entirely pulled by the purse, with zero checks on the marginal power of capital. the prospect of appointing someone like mike lee to the supreme court is terrifying because his agenda is to unleash unlimited spending in political elections to opportunistically help himself, while helping corporate stooges repeal every major piece of legislation that has resulted in gains for the poor, the homeless, the sick, the middle class, and the most disenfranchised in america’s marginalized communities.      trump wants supreme court justice who thinks social security & medicare is unconstitutional      
__label__1 congressional leaders and intelligence officials are investigating whether one of donald trump’s foreign policy “advisers” has opened up private communications with high-level members of the russian government, some of whom are under sanction. according to multiple sources the talks have discussed the possibility that a trump administration would lift the economic sanctions that were imposed on russia after its unilateral annexation of crimea in 2014, an international crime that trump has refused to even acknowledge. the trump adviser, carter page, is a former merrill lynch investment banker in moscow who now runs a new york-based consulting firm, global energy capital, that specializes in oil and gas deals with russia and is located around the block from trump’s office in new york. page was first identified by mr. trump in march as a member of his “foreign policy team,” which is a motley crew of neoconservative oil men, lebanese fascists, and imperial proconsuls from iraq. he has since become one of trump’s most prominent foreign policy spokesmen, although the campaign maintains that he is not officially on the bankroll. page has extensive financial interests in russia, notably in gazprom, the state-run oil and gas giant, and rosneft, the nation’s leading private oil company. he has frequently visited moscow for meetings with high-level officials at the kremlin and in rosneft, and has been “a brazen apologist for anything moscow did” according to a u.s. diplomat in russia. under particular scrutiny is page’s trip to moscow this july, when he met with igor sechin, a long-time putin adviser and former deputy prime minister who is now the head of rosneft and is currently under sanction by the united states government. according to numerous us officials in moscow, page discussed with sechin ways to lift the american sanctions, a cause that is close to page’s heart – and his wallet. last march he told bloomberg news that “so many people i work with have been adversely affected by the sanctions policy” and said that there was “a lot of excitement in terms of the possibilities for creating a better situation.” on that summer trip page reportedly also met with igor devykin, the kremlin’s deputy chief of internal policy who is believed by u.s. officials to be the official responsible for russia’s campaign of meddling in the american election. indeed the original impetus for investigating page came from the congressional investigation into russia’s cyberattacks on the democratic national committee and on voter databases in arizona and illinois. while the democratic leaders of the house and senate intelligence committees have “concluded that the russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the u.s. election” that “could only come from senior levels of the russian government,” trump’s usual chauvinistic bravado has been totally absent in the face of this unprecedented meddling in american democracy by a foreign power. indeed he has denied that russia was even responsible. trump’s evasiveness on the issue is part of a long pattern of scandalous pandering to the russian dictator vladimir putin, from calling him a “better leader” than president obama to promising to hand over the baltic states to the kremlin and going on russian state tv to criticize american foreign policy. trump’s traitorous appeasement of putin, and the shocking monetary ties between his campaign and the inner circle of russian oligarchs have already received some scrutiny – albeit far less than they should – in the american press. in carter page’s moscow meetings, however, we may finally have the smoking gun implicating trump’s campaign – or at least those close to him – in a traitorous plot with the despotic russian government. the bombshell revelations that show trump has received “hundreds of millions” of dollars from russian oligarchs makes it clear why both sides would be interested in repealing the sanctions. could russia be plotting with trump’s associates to influence the election in favor of the donald, placing a kremlin lackey in the white house who will lift sanctions in exchange for an economic windfall for his neoconservative cronies? why else would his top foreign policy adviser promise a blacklisted kremlin official to do what he can to end the sanctions and meet with the russian intelligence official specifically tasked with influencing the american election?      just in: u.s. officials investigating trump campaign’s secret ties to putin’s kremlin      
__label__1 to cap off a week in which police officers shot and killed two unarmed black men, a georgia police officer has been arrested after it was discovered that she had fabricated a story about being shot by black man. jackson officer sherry hall has been charged with “false statements, tampering, interference with government property and a violation of oath of office.” “after following leads and evidence, the investigation has now revealed that there is no, and never was, a suspect shooter at large in jackson, georgia” announced special agent joe wooten, who was investigating the “case.” hall reported that on september 13th, a black man had shot her in her bulletproof vest, but it was discovered that the entire thing – radio call, tear in shirt, spent shell – was all a set-up. the story is a stark reminder that the word of the police cannot always be taken at face value. when a protester was shot in the head during the charlotte riots, the police immediately announced it was a civilian-on-civilian shooting, but multiple eyewitness reports say that it was a rubber bullet fired by riot police. a picture emerged of recently slain disabled black man keith lamont scott showing a gun on the ground – but the video released by his grieving wife shows no gun but instead shows a cop dropping his glove. a police officer in st. louis, missouri, was recently charged with a homicide after it was discovered he had shot and killed a black man and then planted a gun on his body to justify his murder. in an increasingly post-truth political atmosphere, we must demand and receive evidence. we cannot rely on the word of anybody – our politicians or police officers.      just in: georgia cop arrested after shooting herself and blaming “black man”      
__label__1 this thursday ohio republican representative warren davidson reaffirmed his statement that “moochers” and “pretenders” are blocking the veterans affairs’ health care system. at a town hall event monday morning in west chester, ohio boehner’s successor spoke to the concerned veterans for america, accusing the department of veterans affairs’ health care system of buckling under the weight of “moochers.” “just like workers comp out here’s got moochers, i wish that there were no vets that were the same sort of problem on our society,” said davidson. “but part of the problem is there are some vets that are moochers and they’re clogging up the system. and we do as taxpayers want to make sure the va filters out these folks that are pretenders. just like we wish there were no people out there with stolen valor, but that’s a problem in the vet community too.” in response, the gop chairman of the house veterans affairs committee, rep. jeff miller (r-fl), antagonized davison for his reductive remarks but took it easy on him by saying, “i can only hope that rep. davidson misspoke, and i look forward to him clarifying his remarks.” joe davis, a national spokesman for the veterans of foreign wars, also responded negatively to davidson’s comments, saying “honorably discharged veterans with service-connected wounds, illnesses and injuries, or who are indigent due to circumstances beyond their control, are not moochers.” on the other side of the aisle, democrats also seized the opportunity to reject davidson’s remarks, calling them irresponsible and rude. steve fought, a democrat in ohio’s 8th congressional district who ran an election against davidson, said davidson “is the first congressman ever to blame the shortcomings of the va health care system on the veterans themselves.” the chairman of the ohio democratic party, david pepper, also jumped on the bandwagon saying, “i would like to know just how he intends to decide which veterans are worthy of health care and which ones are ‘moochers’. perhaps the congressman is frustrated with the system, but the solution isn’t to kick veterans off the health care coverage they’ve earned through service to their country.” davidson, however was notably unfazed and doubled down on his remarks thursday saying, “as a veteran, i know the subpar care that many of my brothers and sisters in arms have received, and i will not be content until that is changed. any effort to suggest i have anything other than a soldier’s passion for providing our veterans with the care they deserve is dishonest.” despite davidson’s conviction about “moochers” and “pretenders” in the veteran community, only one of the four cases of va benefits fraud found and prosecuted by the inspector general involved va health care services. hardly enough to make a dent in the administration of va health care services, or make sweeping generalizations about a community that has had to make the most tangible sacrifices for the well-being of the nation.      republican congressman: “moocher” veterans are clogging the va      
__label__1 donald trump’s efforts to attract any kind of support from the african-american community has not gone well. after blatantly whitewashing four hundred years of oppression and enslavement by telling american blacks that they’ve “never had it worse” and then telling his supporters that the police brutality protests in charlotte were due to “drugs,” trump’s campaign tried to visit a civil rights museum in north carolina to for a cheap photo-op – but couldn’t even muster the effort to pretend to be sincere about it, and he was resoundingly denied: “we did not honor the request of the donald trump team because we thought they demonstrated, in their approach was disrespectful” said the co-founder of the international civil rights center and museum, earl jones.  “the approach, the type of disrespect, pretty much a demand and bullying us to use the museum in their manner and their way in their time,  it was inappropriate and i think it’s probably reflective of the type of insensitivity of civil rights and human rights that’s reflective from trump over the years.” jones complained that trump’s staff was “aggressive” and “rude,” and that trump’s camp apparently demanded that they close the museum for five hours to accommodate him. “we have equal treatment for everyone coming to the museum and we welcome everyone to the museum but we are not going to allow the museum to be used for political gain.” while it’s not a surprise to learn that the members of the trump campaign are rude, pretentious scumbags, it’s truly illuminating just how deep racism and self-entitlement runs through every level of the “trump train.” we applaud mr. jones and jeer at trump’s people for being entirely incapable of pretending to care about the african-american community. his insistence that blacks have “never had it worse” implies that they had it better under slavery and jim crow, which is a white supremacist line of thought to the core. how any black american could support trump is beyond comprehension.      you’ll never guess what happened when trump tried to visit a civil rights museum      
__label__1 a ninety-six-year-old world war ii veteran and longtime new yorker contributor roger angell has voted in eighteen elections. as he prepares to vote in his nineteenth, he has published an op-ed in which he shares his wisdom and experience – and sends a dire warning to the american people. this man, who has lived through the most dangerous threats to ever face our nation, including the prospect of nuclear armageddon, believes that the election of republican nominee donald trump would be a catastrophe on the same level: “my country faces a danger unmatched in our history since the cuban missile crisis, in 1962, or perhaps since 1943, when the axis powers held most of continental europe, and imperial japan controlled the pacific rim, from the aleutians to the solomon islands, with the outcome of that war still unknown. “ angell acknowledges trump’s long history of outrageously offensive statements but chooses to focus on the one closest to his heart: military service and the lessons of the second world war, the most destructive conflict humanity has ever fought. “i stick at a different moment—the lighthearted comment he made when, in early august, an admiring veteran presented him with a replica of his purple heart and mr. trump said, “i always wanted to get the purple heart. this was much easier.” mr. trump is saying he wishes that he had joined the armed forces somehow (he had a chance but skimmed out, like so many others of his time) and then had died or been scarred or maimed in combat? this is the dream of a nine-year-old boy, and it impugns the five hundred thousand young americans who have died in combat in my lifetime, and the many hundreds of thousands more whose lives were altered or shattered by their wounds of war. i take this personally, representing as i do the last sliver of the sixteen million americans who served in the military in my war…i experienced the loss of more than twenty close friends, classmates, and companions of my youth, who remain young and fresh in memory. i have named them in previous pieces, along with some wounded survivors, like my friend gardner, an infantry captain who landed at normandy beach and fought at hürtgen forest and aachen and the battle of the bulge, was twice wounded…my late brother-in-law neil, who lay wounded on the field for two days during the battle of belfort gap, and who hobbled with a cane all his life, and with two canes near the end. every american of my generation can supply stories like these, and once learned and tried to forget that, worldwide, seventy million people died in our war. far too many people have forgotten the lessons of that dreadful conflict – or never learned them at all, as in trump’s case. trump is a selfish coward at his core; a draft-dodger who then had the nerve to compare his promiscuity with the sacrifices of the hundreds of thousands of young americans who perished in the jungles of vietnam, a man who mocks war heroes and insults the families of our slain warriors, a man who uses our veterans for cheap propaganda stunts and tosses them aside once they’ve served their purpose. trump is uniquely ill-suited for the presidency, a man enslaved by his ego and devoid of principle – negatives that deeply disturb mr. angell. “mr. trump is endlessly on record as someone who will not back down, who cannot appear to pause or lose. he is a man who must win, stay on the attack, and who thinks, first and last, “how will i look?” this is central, and what comes after it, for me, at times, is concern for what it must be like for anyone who, facing an imperative as dark and unforgiving as this, finds only the narcissist’s mirror for reassurance.” on the other hand, mr. angell has glowing praise for democratic nominee hillary clinton, a woman who has spent her entire life in public service, who has shown time and time again that she has a backbone of steel and is up to the pressures of the presidency: i will cast my own vote for hillary clinton with alacrity and confidence. from the beginning, her life has been devoted to public service and to improving the lives of children and the disadvantaged. she is intelligent, strong, profoundly informed, and extraordinarily experienced in the challenges and risks of our lurching, restlessly altering world and wholly committed to the global commonality. her well-established connections to minorities may bring some better understanding of our urban and suburban police crisis. ms. clinton will make a strong and resolute president—at last, a female leader of our own—and, in the end, perhaps a unifying one. he saves his best criticism for the end, however, as he nervously ponders what a president trump might be responding to an ordinary day in the white house: “if donald trump wins this election, his nights in the white house will very soon resemble those of president obama.  a new day is arriving, and with it the latest rush of bad news—another police shooting out west, another suicide bomber in yemen, and other urgent briefings from a world already caught up in the morning’s difficult events. he needs to respond, but the beginning of this president’s response is always reliably at hand: how will i look?” we absolutely cannot elect a president that will put his own public image above the needs of the american people. read the full article here.            wwii veteran pens brutal op-ed slamming draft-dodging trump

__label__1 after months of quiet, mass shootings once again shake the nation. around six a.m this morning, a “disgruntled lawyer” opened fire at a mall in houston, texas, injuring nine before he was killed by police officers. shooter nathan desai was found to have had multiple weapons in his vehicle – all of them legal, as was his right to openly carry his weapons into a public space. as this man was not a muslim, the media narrative is that desai was apparently a “disgruntled” lawyer who was frustrated with his firm’s closing due to lack of customers. but this story gets even weirder. law enforcement sources said that the shooter was wearing what appeared to be an antique german uniform with swastikas on it, and reports indicate that more nazi paraphernalia was discovered in his apartment. why desai was wearing a nazi uniform, where he got it, and any relation to white supremacy or neo-nazi groups are still unclear at the moment. but his attempt to slaughter his countrymen was the 288th mass shooting in this country so far this year, according to watchdog group gunviolencearchive.org. texas’ absurdly lax weapons laws resulted once again in a man opening fire into innocents. there was no good guy with a gun to save the day; just an angry nazi lawyer.      just in: houston mass shooter was dressed in nazi uniform      
__label__1 the washington post’s intrepid reporter david fahrenthold’s investigation into the trump foundation and the finances of republican nominee donald trump have found yet another instance of foul play by the avaricious real estate mogul. it turns out that trump has been using his tax-exempt charitable foundation as a vehicle for tax evasion by having companies that owe his money funnel it through the foundation, allowing him to dodge the taxes on nearly $2.3 million in income.  for instance, the trump foundation received payments “totaling nearly $1.9 million from a man in new york city who sells sought-after tickets and one-of-a-kind experiences to wealthy clients.” anonymous sources within the trump organization indicate that the man, richard ebers, was instructed to pay trump for goods and services to the foundation instead. this helps explain why people kept on “donating” to the trump foundation after it became clear that not even the man it was named after cared enough to put any money into it – his last donation was in 2008. senior trump adviser boris epshteyn said that “what trump did was provide a service, renounce any fees, and then merely ‘suggest’ that the other party make a donation to a charity of their choosing.” which is the exact definition of shady business dealing. the head of the internal revenue service’s non-profit watchdog agency, apparently extremely negligent in his monitoring of the trump foundation, was absolutely dumbfounded by what fahrenthold’s investigation is uncovering. “this is so bizarre, this laundry list of issues. it’s the first time i’ve ever seen this, and i’ve been doing this for 25 years in the irs, and 40 years total”  said marc owens. it is absolutely clear that trump is violating the rules surrounding tax-exempt foundations, rules that were written to stop this exact kind of dishonest money laundering. the consequences of those violations bring monetary penalties, the loss of tax-exempt status, and possibly – if we’re lucky – criminal charges. trump has claimed innocence when queried on the issue. “are you confident that the trump foundation has followed all charitable rules and laws?”asked journalist sharyl attkisson. “well, i hope so…i mean, my lawyers do it” shrugged the republican nominee. the trump foundation has no paid staff, let alone lawyers, so draw your own conclusions from that. it is absolutely astonishing that the trump campaign would have the nerve to go after the clinton foundation when his own “charity” is literally a money-laundering organization that is being used to perpetrate tax fraud, pay political bribes to unscrupulous republican politicians investigating his other fraudulent businesses, and purchase $10,000 paintings of himself. the polar opposite of charitable, donald trump’s greedy schemes border on the comical in their pervasiveness and extension. corruption is his modus operandi, and we cannot allow him to turn our nation into a giant kleptocracy.      breaking: trump caught red-handed using foundation to evade millions in taxes      
__label__1 in case you thought today couldn’t get any more weirder, a trump supporter was busted for selling nazi and confederate flags at the 161st bloomsburg fair in pennsylvania. visitor chloe winters was enjoying the fair when she encountered a white-haired old man selling the flags of fascism and slavery – along with the inevitable “hillary for prison” signs, and she was absolutely appalled. “i was absolutely shocked and appalled when i saw this nazi flag hanging at the bloomsburg fair yesterday. this flag represents the brutal and horrific genocide of innocent people. it stands for the hatred and destruction of a religion i feel blessed to be a part of. it’s 2016 and the world is still full of so much hate. when is it going to end? i’m sad to say that i’ll never go to the bloomsburg fair again, but it looks like i’m not wanted there anyway” she wrote on facebook. as if the man wasn’t deplorable enough already, it turns out that flag-vendor lawrence betsinger is also a registered sex-offender for his conviction of more than 20 counts of possessing child pornography, which he doesn’t seem to believe is a big deal. ““i didn’t do anything wrong. i downloaded some shit on the internet” he told phillymag.com. betsinger doesn’t seem to understand what the fuss over the flags are, either. “if you don’t want it, don’t look at it. i’m not making anybody buy it. i guess there’s no first amendment at the bloomsburg fair. i can’t see where it would be some tragic thing just because somebody bitched and moaned about it.” deplorable indeed.      trump-supporting sex offender thrown out of fair for selling nazi flags

__label__1 during tonight’s debate, republican nominee donald trump said that he received a “small loan” from his father to begin his business career. that “small loan” was for over a million dollars, and his father continued to give him financial backing throughout the early years of his career. his “success” is proof of the adage that you “need money to make money,” as he borrowed $14 million from his father and received a blind trust fund which gave him another million. trump complained to politico that “it has not been easy for me. it has not been easy for me. i started off in brooklyn. my father gave me a small loan of a million dollars,” trump remarked. “i came into manhattan, and i had to pay him back, and i had to pay him back with interest. but i came into manhattan and i started buying properties, and i did great.” yes, poor trump spent his early years in expensive boarding schools and was given start-up money for his “business” career, the success of which has been questionable at best, given his multiple bankruptcies. it’s hard to imagine anyone more representative of the selfish excesses of wealthy america or be more disconnected from the struggles of everyday americans. it’s mind-boggling to understand how anyone can pretend this man cares or even understands the problems facing the american middle class.        trump just said he got a “small loan” from his dad. he got way more      
__label__1 legendary washington post journalist carl bernstein went on cnn with brian stelter in the aptly named “reliable sources” program, when the host asked one of the least important questions on the campaign trail today – yet another inquiry into democratic nominee hillary clinton’s health. bernstein’s response was perfect: there is a much larger question about the overall coverage of this campaign by the electronic media, by cable and network news. we’ve been terrific at interpretation at giving equal time to debate panels, but we’ve been positively awful in terms of reporting in a coherent way the biggest story of this campaign: the real existing life and records of donald trump. the new york times, the washington post, the wall street journal have done fabulous reporting on this and we give snippets of it.we need to be doing an hour, two hours a night of real biography, running it over and over of what trump’s life and record have been about because they’re at absolute odds with the mythical and lying story that he has told us. he’s a con man. it’s been established. and also he has presided over a cover up of his own life. and we have allowed it in cable news and network news particularly. few journalists in america today are more respected than carl bernstein and his colleague bob woodward, whose doggedly persistent journalism uncovered the last time republicans broke into the democratic national committee for political reasons, and ultimately forced president richard nixon to resign from office in 1974 amidst the watergate affair. unlike the 1970s, this time we found out the results of the russian invasion into dnc email servers almost immediately. then the republican candidate departed from all norms of political behavior by any party in america to ask his patron,russian strongman vladimir putin to hack democratic candidate hillary clinton’s campaign servers, leading almost immediately to another electronic strike. the real question is: why hasn’t the cable television media noticed any of this and taken the time to dig further into the detailed reports, like proof that the republican candidate faces serious racketeering charges related to trump university, that long before the suspected labor and immigration violating trump models lawsuit, we found evidence of human trafficking practices in the nominee’s reality tv show productions for mtv? every major newspaper in florida is calling for a federal investigation of trump university, but thus far cnn and fox are more interested in hillary clinton’s health and ignoring the actual facts that donald trump is 70 years old, lied about his height to hide his obesity, and says that making hand gestures during rallies is “exercise.” cnn’s stelter replied to carl bernstein’s sincere comment with the kind of misguided mainstream media groupthink talking points which might’ve come straight out of a campaign’s deflection and spin files, blaming the reality of trump’s lifelong con job being under reported on “liberals” wanting to discuss facts. bernstein shut him down without question: it’s not just liberals, i think it’s conservatives, too, there is realization that trump is a con man. and that that is a big part of the story. look, we have reported and nobody has been tougher on hillary clinton especially on the server question than i, i’ve said it’s indefensible what she did with it, and we have reported on her whole life. she has been around for 25, 30 years in public on the public stage. and we know her every position and record and her life. trump is different. we haven’t — it’s not equal. it’s disequal that we have allowed donald trump to play us like this and we focus on his outrageous statements which we do every day and we give equal time to those on his side and hillary’s side debating these crazy statements and positions that he changes every day. and we analyze that, but do we go back and look at his whole business record? no. we don’t. it’s sad to watch cnn drown in the effluvia of it’s own conflicted interests, while broadcasting a trump hotel infomercial live, and without during the hourlong advertisement for the republican bigot mention that all of its contents were not made in the usa by the xenophobic candidate who advocates protectionism and charges $805 a night to stay in half-finished digs a few blocks from the white house, nor did cnn mention that trump’s hotel chain is wallowing in vacancy because of the stigma attached to its name. since when did providing actual facts become just a liberal idea in the media, rather than the purpose of america’s free press? we scratch our heads along with carl bernstein. watch it here:      legendary watergate reporter rips trump, tells media to do its damn job (video)      
__label__1 the story of how a group of black clubgoers were turned away at the door of a club is going viral. ashley ellis sisco and a group of friends attempted to visit the kandy bar in charlotte, north carolina. they were turned away at the door and told they needed a membership to get in, but a group of white girls behind them told them that wasn’t the case. the bouncers, clearly racially profiling, allowed the white girls to enter while sisco filmed them turning away a black man with dreads. sisco later posted in the comments that “the sad thing is that we all work in public service. it was a group of nurses, teachers, bankers people who serve the community and work with every race and ethnicity without judgement….and we have to go back into the community we serve and be treated like trash.” it is clear that in north carolina, a state where support for the confederacy still is very strong, racism is still a major part of their identity, and this kind of display of casual racism makes it clear how donald trump is so popular in this country.       charlotte nightclub caught letting only whites inside in viral video      
__label__1 a group of over fifty former intelligence officials and national security experts have written a letter demanding that he disclose the details of his “overseas business investments.” signed by both republicans and democrats, the call for transparency comes as trump defiantly doubles down on his refusal to release his tax returns and reveal any potential conflicts of interest he might have as president. “donald trump still has not revealed to the american public his international business relationships, even as it becomes increasingly clear that his overseas ties could well constitute significant conflicts of interest when it comes to charting u.s. foreign policy. this is unprecedented for a candidate for the nation’s highest office. as such, we are calling on mr. trump to disclose, in full, the nature of his business relationships overseas — to include specifically who his business partners are and what and where are his foreign investments. the newsweek article reports that mr. trump courted muammar qaddafi, a dictator who murdered his own people and who once pursued nuclear weapons and conducted terrorism against americans. newsweek also asserts that mr. trump’s other business partners have included kremlin-tied oligarchs and russians with mafia links, an individual accused of money laundering for the iranian military, a turkish media tycoon accused of running a fuel-smuggling ring, indian companies that may have violated india’s laws in their pursuit of business with mr. trump, and a south korean company mired in scandal. importantly, according to this news item, mr. trump’s business partnerships owe millions of dollars to chinese entities. on the campaign trail, mr. trump has repeatedly praised vladimir putin’s authoritarian leadership, while outlining policies that read like a kremlin wish list. he has claimed that putin would never invade ukraine, suggested permanently ceding crimea to russia and placed conditions on upholding our obligation to protect our nato allies. he has floated lifting sanctions against russia, which would benefit both putin and the trump organization. our policies must be motivated exclusively by what is in america’s best interest, not by the financial interests of our president. the onus is on donald trump to assure voters that this will be the case by disclosing the nature of his overseas relationships and committing to divest such assets.” the letter was penned by signatories as noted as former acting cia director michael j. morell, former undersecretary of defense michael g. vickers, and former national security adviser samantha vinograd. trump’s refusal to release his tax returns would appear to indicate that there are some serious irregularities that could potentially doom his candidacy for president, which his son pretty much confirmed in a foolish statement. the content of those tax returns has been the subject of much speculation, but given trump’s long history of tax evasion and political bribery, it doesn’t take much imagination to assume he’s committing some kind of fraud. he’s also suspected of accepting bribes from russian oligarchs and has done business with authoritarian rulers like libya’s now-deceased muammar qaddafi, the emirs of the united arab emirates, and the kingdom of saudi arabia’s ruling house of saud. so what exactly are you hiding, mr. trump? the full letter can be found here.      just in: 50 ex-military & intelligence leaders demand trump reveal foreign investments      
__label__1 during a fox and friends interview monday morning to talk about the nyc bombings, donald trump came dangerously close to suggesting unheard of levels of censorship. trump asserted that the the biggest obstacle towards stopping terrorism at home is the first amendment and the lax attitude surrounding freedom of the press. referring to jihadi propaganda, the donald said: “they’re all talking about it so wonderfully because, you know, it’s called “freedom of the press,” where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make these same bombs that i saw. they tell you how to make bombs. we should arrest the people that do that because they’re participating in crime. instead they say “oh no you can’t do anything, that’s freedom of expression.” of course, this is wild conjecture. there is no way donald trump has absolutely any idea why the new york bomber decided to build these bombs, the information for which is easily found in a cursory google search, which has nothing to do with how that possibly relates to the print news media’s freedom of expression, which he’s criticized on numerous occasions. the type of publications that would even contain this kind of information – we’re assuming he’s referring to the daeshi magazine, dabiq –  are diligently hunted down and taken off the website by counterterror forces. but the most terrifying aspect of this line of thinking, is how casually it could use the “boogeyman of terrorism” to make freedom of speech disposable, setting a dangerous precedent that could be expanded to censor any kind of dissenting opinion. trump, has long demonstrated his disdain for the press, and has a chilling history that suggests he would be open to embracing unconstitutional censorship. trump has praised the leadership of russia, admiring its “strength” despite its history of censorship and human rights abuses including state control of the media and regular murder of dissident journalists. back in august, he took to twitter and railed against “the corrupt media” and freedom of the press for having the audacity to look into his personal life and to dig up the skeletons in his closet. although trump has never actually revealed what he would do to address this grievance with the press, his comments underscore a grim future ahead for america if he is elected. trump has taken every opportunity to criticize and attempt to discredit anyone that disagrees with him in any way, leaving behind a trail of journalists and citizens fed up with appalling lack of regard to the first amendment and the founding principles of our nation. here’s the full interview with fox & friends:       just in: trump exploits nyc bombing to call for rolling back “freedom of press”      
__label__1 social security has been called the third rail of american politics: touch it and you die. and if that is indeed the case, then donald trump might want to start picking out a nice casket. bloomberg is reporting that when the gop nominee met with paul ryan on may 12, he told the house speaker that he does indeed favor cutting social security, but he’s afraid to say so publicly because it would doom his chances in november. bloomberg cites an unnamed source who was in the room when the meeting was held. according to the source, trump told ryan: “from a moral standpoint, i believe in it. but you also have to get elected. and there’s no way a republican is going to beat a democrat when the republican is saying, ‘we’re going to cut your social security’ and the democrat is saying, ‘we’re going to keep it and give you more.’ ” this is in stark contrast to what trump has repeatedly said on the campaign trail. trump has said time and time again that he would leave social security alone. alex lawson, executive director of social security works, believes the real intent of trump is the same as that of most republicans: drastically cutting benefits while pretending to support the program: “it is really clear: donald trump would 100 percent go along with the republican donor class position of cutting social security. he openly says he will lie to the people about it because he knows that the people are against it. “in his eyes the ‘moral’ thing to do is to steal people’s hard-earned benefits and not talk about it.”   as we have seen repeatedly during the 2016 campaign, trump lies about everything, reverses his positions on issues by the hour, and often seems to be utterly lost when asked for specifics about various policy questions. the man is an idiot. he is also a danger to the very essence of american democracy. featured image via flickr available under a creative commons attribution-sharealike 2.0 generic license      trump says he supports slashing social security from a ‘moral standpoint’      
__label__1 on monday, congressman lee zeldin (r-ny) took to twitter to use the apprehension of lead suspect in the nyc bombing investigation, ahmad khan rahami, to take a shot at san francisco 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick in an exceptionally clumsy attempt to connect his police recent brutality protests with terrorism, writing “you are welcome” after noting that rahami was taken into custody:  zeldin obviously thought the tweet would give him the final say in the matter and a chance to say he thought kaepernick was ungrateful, but the internet had other plans. after firing off his passive aggressive swipe at  the football player, twitter would declare open season on him and continue to to roast him after declaring his ridiculous comment the new, “thanks, obama.”  like “thanks, obama” in which democrats mocked how republicans went out of their way to link extremely remote events as outcomes of president obama’s presidency, “you’re welcome, kaepernick” could now be used to illustrate how absurdly far the right would stretch to manufacture a situation colin kaepernick should be grateful for.   the tweet made it to several verified accounts, most notably reaching host of matter of fact tv’s soledad o’brien. all in all, we can probably guess this is not how congressman zeldin planned on this tweet working out for him. lets hope this bully learns his humiliating lesson, and stop trying to exploit a national scare to increase his national profile.         twitter explodes in mockery after republican congressman blames kaepernick for nyc bombing      
__label__1 when republicans decided to vote for a guy who promised skip pandering to oligarchs for money, little did they know their presidential nominee meant to hand control of america’s highest offices to those very billionaires directly. word has leaked that donald trump plans to nominate oil executive forrest lucas as interior minister, breaking the long tradition of naming those from the rural western states to lead the agency which manages america’s public parks, lands and wildlife. this would be disastrous for the fair enforcement of the endangered species act, protecting the environment from the devastating effects of fracking, and animal rights in general, because forrest lucas is the sort of man who literally fights for the right to exploit animals in entertainment and is an avowed enemy of the humane society which provides low cost veterinary services, spaying and neutering to pet owners across the usa, as politico writes: lucas, who owns a ranch and serves on trump’s agriculture advisory committee, is one of the biggest donors to groups that attack the humane society and people for the ethical treatment of animals, and defend animal agriculture, hunting, meat consumption, rodeos and circuses. another source with knowledge of the transition operation said lucas was on a short list of about five names that are under consideration for the post, which has started to attract considerable interest from prominent “anti-conservation zealots.” in a public hint of the rampant nepotism that trump is planning to make official policy, they even said that the infamous cheetah killer, trump’s self-entitled son don jr., is also in the running for interior secretary. the interior ministry quite literally owns 28% of america’s land, manages our national parks and forests, the federal fish & wildlife service, and also makes major decisions in the gambling industry because of its oversight of the commission that regulates tribal casinos. the department of interior holds massive sway over mineral extraction rights and leasing on public lands too, so the oil industry relies on it for decisions, regulations and pays rent to uncle sam through that government agency too. the sierra club issued a stark warning about what trump’s choice means for the country: “putting an oil executive in charge of our public lands and precious coasts in places like north carolina, virginia and florida is a virtual guarantee that trump’s promise to throw open season on drilling in our special places will come true if he’s elected.” lucas is the kind of heartless swine who fought (and thankfully failed) to stop a voter ballot initiative that targeted cruel puppy mills in missouri in 2010. it’s scary to watch while donald trump dangles choices for a powerful appointed public office so outrageous it seems almost comical. if the only two choices are a reactionary oil company oligarch who will certainly plunder our nation’s natural bounty like a child in a candy shop and supports animal cruelty as a policy platform or the silver-spoon-fed self-entitled neo-nazi misogynist scion who takes pleasure in slaughtering defenseless endangered animals with high-powered weapons, one might ask if this was a made-for-tv movie. but donald trump is very serious – as is the threat he poses to our country.        just in: trump to pick oil tycoon who hates animals to oversee national parks      
__label__1 federal prosecutors began the first “bridgegate” criminal trial by leveling their biggest accusations at new jersey governor chris christie, even though his two main deputies are the ones on trial this week. at least one known death was attributed to bridgegate by the news media. even though christie isn’t a defendant in today’s court action, the stunning revelation from prosecutors means they may still see him as the ultimate target of their three year criminal investigation, as nj.com reported: u.s. attorney vikas khanna, describing the chaos of the traffic jams that paralyzed fort lee beginning on sept. 9, 2013, said david wildstein,  a former port authority employee who plead guilty to federal charges last year, will admit he was the one who came up with that idea. the prosecutor added that wildstein will testify he and baroni told christie about the scheme at the very moment traffic was at a standstill in fort lee during a sept. 11 commemoration manhattan. “the evidence will show that baroni and wildstein were so committed to their plan to punish mayor sokolich that during those precious few minutes that they had alone with the governor, they bragged about the fact that there were traffic problems in fort lee and that mayor sokolich was not getting his calls returned. this case is about the defendants abuse of power and their callous disregard for the people of fort lee,” said khanna. last year, trump publicly accused christie of knowing about bridgegate, but after the former federal prosecutor knocked out marco rubio in a primary debate and pledged blind fealty to the orange-faced one, the two republicans have become nearly inseparable, no doubt brought together over a mutual love of mcdonald’s. federal prosecutors are seeking to convict bill baroni, the former deputy executive director of the port authority of new york and new jersey, and bridget anne kelly, who was governor christie’s deputy chief of staff.  the only thing that the defense, prosecutors and all of the accused actually agree upon, is that the new jersey republican knew about his subordinates’ political retribution against a local mayor. in fact, defense lawyers claim that the disruptive shutdown of the george washington bridge connecting fort lee to new york city now known as bridgegate had to be covered up to protect christie’s now tarnished political career, because even back in 2013 he was plotting a presidential campaign: defense lawyers have long argued that mr. christie, a republican, and his top advisers were well aware of the lane closings and that they directed the cover-up as they tried to protect the governor’s political aspirations — saying their clients were “thrown under the presidential bus,” as one lawyer argued on monday. but this was the first time a prosecutor had pointed a finger at mr. christie. and it directly contradicts the governor’s statements in the three years since the lanes were mysteriously closed, paralyzing the borough of fort lee, n.j. as usual, the new york times understates the forcefulness of chris christie’s prior defense of his blatant lies in bridgegate. we uncovered this extraordinary video where the new jersey republican spent an astonishing two hours lying to the media in a televised press conference where he plainly claimed not to know anything. for years, christie has claimed that he got away with the crime of using his public office for political purposes to harm hundreds of thousands of new york and new jersey residents stuck in massive traffic jams caused by his irresponsible republican administration. from the sound of federal prosecutors, it appears that they simply waited until they had every other co-conspirator so firmly within their grasp to serve christie notice, and he’s the most likely final target of this prosecution. watch his shame:       federal prosecutors accuse chris christie of masterminding bridgegate (video)      
__label__1 republicans have been crossing party lines to announce their votes for democratic nominee hillary clinton throughout this year’s general election in numbers not seen in decades. now, politico reports that the highest level defection yet comes from former president george h. w. bush, who revealed to a kennedy that it was time to go public in favor of the democratic party’s candidate hillary clinton: bush, 92, had intended to stay silent on the white house race between clinton and donald trump, a sign in and of itself of his distaste for the gop nominee. but his preference for the wife of his own successor, president bill clinton, nonetheless became known to a wider audience thanks to kathleen hartington kennedy townsend, the former maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late robert f. kennedy. the republican party’s embrace of unrepentant racism under trump is personally stinging to the bush family after his sons jeb bush married women of hispanic origins and learned spanish. it’s no surprise that the eldest bush of the bunch would declare early his vote for hillary clinton. both of texas’ major daily newspapers in houston and dallas, who are both deeply conservative news organizations, endorsed hillary clinton long before this year’s presidential debates, which kick off next week. it must be reassuring to the elder statesman’s rare crossing of party lines, knowing that he can trust the depth of hillary clinton’s national security experience and that her relationships with foreign leaders is unmatched by any party’s nominee in possibly all of our nation’s history. former president george h.w. bush won’t be the last prominent republican to declare for hillary clinton in this year’s general election, but he is one of the few whose judgement we can actually respect.      unprecedented: pres. h.w. bush stuns republicans, endorses hillary      
__label__1 donald trump jr. has jammed his foot squarely in his mouth once again, with a particularly offensive tweet which compared syrian refugees fleeing chlorine gas and napalm to “poisoned skittles.” this image says it all. let’s end the politically correct agenda that doesn’t put america first. #trump2016 pic.twitter.com/9fhwog7ssn — donald trump jr. (@donaldjtrumpjr) september 19, 2016  let’s be very clear. the united states does not have a syrian refugee problem. our nation has accepted ten thousand refugees from syria, a paltry number of the 4.6 milion syrians that have been displaced by the horrifying violence of the syrian civil war. none of them have been connected to any domestic terrorist attacks in the united states, all of which have been committed by naturalized citizens, but the donald trump campaign continues to demonize these desperate people trying to escape the appalling bloodshed in their homeland. as npr noted, “the odds of being killed by a refugee in a terrorist attack are about 1 in more than 3.6 billion, according to a recent cato institute study.” the company which makes skittles, wrigley’s, reached out to hollywood reporter seth abramovitch with this epic response, which really says it all.  for the so-called party of “family values” to be fear-mongering over women and children running for their lives is the height of hypocrisy. we’d like to see a self-entitled dandy like donald trump jr. walk a day in their shoes. here’s the somber reality of the situation: @donaldjtrumpjr this is the refugee crisis. not skittles. this. #skittleswelcome @realdonaldtrump pic.twitter.com/iypiuwthdv — sheila g.

__label__1 a new investigation has determined that donald trump’s charitable foundation funneled other people’s money into settling his lawsuits, which violates laws preventing charitable organizations from accepting donors funds and benefitting those who run the foundations. with a stroke of the pen trump pilfered the average wage of five working americans to payoff his business fines: donald trump spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire’s for-profit businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents. those cases, which together used $258,000 from trump’s charity, were among four newly documented expenditures in which trump may have violated laws against “self-dealing” — which prohibit nonprofit leaders from using charity money to benefit themselves or their businesses. the washington post‘s david farenthold has doggedly chased down every lead from the donald j. trump foundation and is in the process of singlehandedly using a dog-eared notebook (they’ve shown photos of it) to literally do what the entire news media is afraid of doing: a complete fact check of donald trump’s dubious history of illegal self-dealing and political corruption. it was farenthold’s investigation which has now caused every major newspaper in florida to call for a federal investigation into the trump university pay-for-play scandal where the very same foundation trump robbed to payoff lawsuits also made an illegal campaign contribution to florida attorney general pam bondi. now his reporting shows that he used the same foundation to settle a $120,000 fine for mar-a-lago, trump’s glitzy party palace in palm beach and the nation’s largest private home. trump was supposed to donate money to a veteran’s foundation, instead he simply took it from others who donated to the foundation instead. ironically, it was all because of the size of a flagpole: in one case, from 2007, trump’s mar-a-lago club faced $120,000 in unpaid fines from the town of palm beach, fla., resulting from a dispute over the size of a flagpole. in a settlement, palm beach agreed to waive those fines — if trump’s club made a $100,000 donation to a specific charity for veterans. instead, trump sent a check from the donald j. trump foundation, a charity funded almost entirely by other people’s money, according to tax records. this wasn’t just charity for the wealthy; it was a direct subsidy to one of the trump organization’s most prized businesses. but it wouldn’t be the only six figure heist engineered by donald trump with little more than the stroke of a pen. when you watch donald trump pitch his golf course in scotland on a campaign trip, just remember that the mismanagement of his expensive golf courses frequently land the republican nominee in court. wapo reports that: one of trump’s golf courses in new york agreed to settle a lawsuit by making a donation to the plaintiff’s chosen charity. a $158,000 donation was made by the trump foundation, according to tax records. on top of that, trump also used his charitable foundation’s funds to buy a 6-foot tall oil canvas painting of himself and a $12,000 tim tebow football helmet. the latest find by farenthold uncovered that he spent another $10,000 on second portrait of himself as well as $5000 for advertisements for his chain of hotels. we hear that the latest of trump’s charitable oil-on-canvas selfies is smaller. the new york attorney general has already opened an investigation into the donald j. trump foundation for its illegal transaction with florida’s attorney general, and these new revelations appear to fit right in with the pattern of the republican’s nominee for president which we know all too well by now. donald trump is all too happy to lie or cheat or steal, as long as he can get away with it. here’s the check proving that trump stole from his donors to pay for mar-a-lago’s debts:       illegal: trump stole $258,000 from his non-profit’s donors to settle for-profit lawsuits, says washington post      
__label__1 it only took seth meyers ten minutes to blow up the gullible media for broadcasting an hour-long trump infomercial, willfully spreading more of the republican nominee’s outrageous lies and allowing him to twist the narrative and pretend that he hasn’t been leading the birther movement for the past five years while using the occasion to promote his new hotel. after a half an hour of free advertising, trump finally tossed the media the bone they were waiting for, a thirty second statement with no apology that falsely claimed that hillary clinton started the birther movement in the first place. you don’t peddle racist rhetoric for five years and then decide when it’s over. we decide when it’s over. and it’s certainly not over after a thirty second statement in a thirty minute hotel commercial. he’s right. donald trump is a shameless birther, a man who spent half a decade making racist claims about president obama long past any rational point of interest, questioning the president’s birthplace and religion for the sake of personal attention within the bigot wing of the republican party. anyone naïve enough to believe that donald trump isn’t a hate-mongering politician merely must look at that thirty second statement, which was immediately followed by the a concentrated effort by the trump campaign to gaslight the country and claim innocence while blaming democratic nominee hillary clinton. “i’m not sure the guy who holds fake press conferences, has a fake university, a fake foundation, fake hair, and a fake tan, should be in charge of deciding what’s real!” rips meyers. but it’s a crock of lies, and seth meyers called out the republican nominee for knowingly pulling the hotel commercial stunt which trump admitted in a tweet. meyers pointed out that even cnn’s anchors thought donald trump was full of crap while their infomercial was rolling, but they didn’t cut or break away and kept letting the republican candidate hawk his hotel anyway. meyers then rips into trump surrogate and disgraced new jersey governor chris christie for defending trump while prosecutors are accusing him of orchestrating the “bridgegate scandal.”the traditional “objective” style of coverage with it’s he said-she said equivalence is not capable of aptly conveying the factual reality of the gushing sewer of falsehoods that is donald trump. we who write here seek to ably analyze the news from a reasonable person’s point of view and present to you our readers what has actually occurred with a transparent written analysis of events based on the solid and established facts at hand in our detailed stories. it’s about time that the media quit giving a free pass to trump and his lying pack of surrogates, scoundrels and birthers. if they remind the entire country daily that the republican nominee is a racist birther for at least 30 seconds of each political news program daily, maybe it would help make up for the three billion dollars in free advertising they’ve already gifted to his vile campaign of hatred. watch it here:       seth meyers destroys trump’s lie that hillary started birtherism (video)      
__label__1 the new york times has joined a number of other major print media publications in denouncing donald trump as a liar. writers at quartz have noted that “in at least five articles in the new york times on sept. 17, including the lead story in the print edition, the words “lie,” “false,” “falsely claimed” and “untrue” appeared in headlines, lead paragraphs, and top sections of the paper’s trump coverage. executive editor dean baquet” said that “i think our investigative work—see [the sept. 17] story on trump’s tax breaks—has always been hard hitting. but we have decided to be more direct in calling things out when a candidate actually lies…the birther issue represents, well, outright lying. and he lied over a long period. it is a real word and we will use it when warranted.” hopefully this dramatic shift in tone will be a cue to the rest of the mainstream media to abandon their insistence on treating trump’s statements with more legitimacy than they deserve out of a desire to remain impartial. the right-wing has been exploiting that impartiality for far too long. the republican primary debates were filled with outright falsehoods and imaginary statistics that largely went unchallenged; and trump’s entire campaign is based on statements which are simply untrue. but it appears that trump’s attempt to gaslight the nation and convince us that it was actually democratic nominee hillary clinton that created the “birther” myth (which is decidedly false) was the last straw for the highly respected editors at the new york times.      just in: new york times will finally start calling trump a “liar”      
__label__1 while the media was busy talking about the nyc bombings and the arrest of ahmad khan rahami, there was another bomb threat in houston, texas that did not receive nearly the same media attention. la times reporter matt pierce felt the incident was doomed from the start, and took to twitter to imply that this story was pretty much guaranteed to not receive as much attention as the nyc bombings because of the skin color of the criminal involved.  according to a news release from u.s. attorney kenneth magidson, houston man cary lee ogborn was arrested last friday after he was discovered to be at the center of a bomb plot targeting houston, texas. the statement from the u.s. attorney specified that, “cary lee ogborn is charged with attempting to transport explosives with the intent that those explosives be used to kill, injure, or intimidate any individual or to damage or destroy a vehicle or building. he was arrested late friday after picking up a package he believed contained such explosives.” although ogborn’s plan to attack houston was thwarted before it could cause a tragedy, matt pearce’s tweet struck a chord with many people who are disappointed the media is more likely to push a story when it advances a criminal narrative that fits a profitable “news-worthy formula” usually including islamic terrorism or black and latino criminality. despite the high-profile coverage of several attacks committed by islamic terrorists, the numbers just do not reflect this narrative. research from gallup and the triangle center on homeland and security found that “law enforcement agencies in the united states consider anti-government violent extremists, not radicalized muslims, to be the most severe threat of political violence that they face” due to the fact that “muslim-american terrorist suspects and perpetrators in the decade since 9/11, [represent] just a small percentage of the thousands of acts of violence that occur in the united states each year.”       meet this week’s white texan terrorist trump isn’t talking about      
__label__1 penn jillette, most famous for being one half of magician duo penn & teller, has shared with reason tv about how trump is more dangerous than anybody suspects, citing his time working with him on  jillette talked to nick gillespie about how, similar to many aspects of trump’s campaign, even the fundamental set up of the reality show was based on a lie. “i mean, we’re co-workers on a television show,” jillette said. “he’s not seeing if he’s going to hire me. he has no job. the places he could hire me—the casinos that he has that have showrooms—he put into bankruptcy. he no longer owns them. so, he can’t hire me, plus i have a job, so that’s all completely fake, right?” jillette reported that while he was on the show, the trump organization tried to coerce him into endorsing a potential trump presidency. “there was a time when they asked me while i was still on the show if donald trump ran for president, if i’d support him, and i said absolutely not. and i believe, and this may be the most damning thing you’ll hear me say about trump, i believe i liked him more than anyone else who was on that show. during that time i said i would not support him for president. now, i get a call instantly. instantly! from the powers that be—not trump himself—saying, ‘no, no, no. you must support him as president.’ they say ‘it’s going to come down to you and trace [adkins], and he’s going to want to know that you both support him for president. and i said, ‘well, i don’t.’ and they said, ‘well, you have to because he’s trying to—he’s looking at the big picture here.’ and i go, ‘we’re on a television show.'” penn is an avowed libertarian, loyal to neither the republican or the democratic parties, and currently endorses gary johnson. despite not being a big fan of clinton, penn says that trump is an unusually incompetent candidate: “however bad you think he is, he’s worse.” “i think he doesn’t really have strong convictions and sense of right and wrong. he’s not really, really smart. he’s not stupid, you know. he’s not a dumb guy, but he’s not smart like presidents are smart. we make jokes—everybody’s makes jokes except me about george w. bush not being smart. he’s smart. he just is. obama’s smarter? probably, sure. obama’s smarter than clinton? probably. almost certainly. but they’re up here, you know, and if we’re talking about it. you’re wherever you are, but you’re not smarter than obama, you know. none of us are. even the smart guys you know aren’t there. and trump isn’t one of those people. he’s not someone who when you’re having a conversation with him—i probably listened to him talk for, i don’t want to exaggerate, but probably eight or nine hours. a monologue of trump. and i can’t think of one thing he said that i went, ‘oh yeah!'”            magician penn jillette had to work with trump: “however bad you think he is, he’s worse.”      
__label__1 once again, donald trump and the republican party’s fear-mongering about immigrants is proven false. ever since an improvised explosive device injured 29 in chelsea, new york city, trump and his goons have revived one of their favorite talking points – vilifying syrian refugees. “these attacks and many others were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country” yelled trump at one of his notorious hate-rallies on september 19th. he later went on fox news and in one broad stroke, painted all immigrants with outrageous hyperbole: “think of it, hillary clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands of these same people that are, you know, they have such hatred and sickness in their heart. it’s sickness, and it’s hatred, and she wants to allow hundreds of thousands more to come in.” in fact, mr. trump, the truth is the bombing was committed by a naturalized american citizen – and authorities caught the suspect thanks to a sikh immigrant, harinder bains. he is the owner of the bar in whose doorway ahmad rahami decided to take a nap in. when bains saw the man’s face on cnn, he did what any responsible citizen would do. he called the cops. “i did what i think every american would have done. my neighbor would have done the same thing. any jewish, christian, sikh, muslim. anybody would have done the same thing…i’m from sikh faith. i’ve been taught always stand up against the atrocities, any kind of persecution” said bains to cnn’s chris cuomo. he’s absolutely right – because our nation is a nation of immigrants. all of our forefathers are immigrants who colonized this land and committed genocide against the native peoples. nobody has any more or less of a right to be here than everyone else, and picking on syrian refugees because they’re muslims fleeing chlorine gas and barrel bombs is the lowest of the low.  our nation has accepted ten thousand refugees from syria, a paltry number of the 4.6 milion syrians that have been displaced by the horrifying violence of the syrian civil war. none of them have been connected to any domestic terrorist attacks in the united states.  the chance of being killed by a refugee in a terrorist attack is 1 in 3.6 billion; you are at much more danger from your own countrymen and their firearms. mr. bains’ actions reaffirm the notion that unity and welcome are our greatest assets. when immigrants feel accepted by a community, it becomes their community and they will work just as hard to defend it as anyone would. for instance, the orlando shooter was reported to the fbi by an immigrant at his local mosque after he discovered evidence of mateen’s radicalization; racist trump supporters repaid him by burning his house of worship to the ground. mr. trump and his campaign’s racist rhetoric only serves to drive us apart and puts us in more danger. he is the real threat to america – not refugee or immigrants.      trump silent as police credit a sikh immigrant with capturing nyc bomber      
__label__1 newly released footage has shed a troubling new light on a 2011 police shooting in st. louis, showing an officer gun down a black suspect and then planting a gun on the crime scene. officer jason stockley and his partner brian bianchi had engaged drug suspect anthony lamar smith in a high speed chase. stockley can be heard saying “i’m going to kill this motherfucker.” the police rammed smith off the road, and camera footage shows stockley shooting five shots into the driver’s seat of smith’s disabled car. new footage now reveals stockley taking a gun out of a duffel back from the back of his own cruiser and planting it on smith’s body. stockley claimed in his report that smith had pointed the weapon at him, justifying the use of lethal force. subsequent dna evidence on the gun, however, did not contain any dna or fingerprints from smith. stockley will be tried for first degree murder. one of his initial hearings takes place on oct. 3rd. footage of the killing can be found here:                   st. louis cop caught on film planting a gun on a man he just killed      
__label__1 republican presidential nominee donald trump claims to have “a great relationship with the blacks“while nearly every poll shows trump losing the constituency by 80 percent or more. one of trump’s vile advisers went so far as to say trump doesn’t speak in front of predominately black crowds because he fears for his life, and with trump’s recent disgusting comments in north carolina about black voters, it is no surprise as to why. the failed businessman gave a rambling, fact lacking, nonsensical speech in kenansville, north carolina where he lamented about democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton’s lack of foreign policy experience, despite clinton being the most qualified presidential candidate in american history. after trump’s failed attack, he moved on show the nation why black voters do not support his candidacy : our african american communities are in the worse shape they’ve ever been… ever. ever. ever. this single tweet explains trump’s racism perfectly:    it is quite convenient for trump to neglect eras of history in the united states where black individuals were in, as he put it, “worse shape.” apparently, trump forgot the ancient times of less than 60 years ago, where black people were dehumanized, beaten, and shot with fire hoses while they attempted to fight for equal and fair treatment under the law. if trump were to look at his history book, which isn’t going to happen because the only books he owns are about how hitler was a swell guy, he’d find it wasn’t until 1967 that the supreme court struck down anti-interracial marriage laws in seventeen states making it legal for black and white people to marry anywhere in the united states. perhaps the fake billionaire meant that black people were better off in america as slaves? that would be one of trump’s best business concepts towards profits. trump would reason black individuals would be fools not to prefer slavery, as they would be losing out on confirmed lifelong job security. the pandering by trump to the vilest racists among his ignorant constituency is no longer a dog whistle, but a blatant declaration that america as a nation is divided by race. he is implicitly longing to return to an era of segregated bathrooms, restaurants, and water fountains. trump highly preferred america when good honest white folks were given all of the best seats on public transportation, and black people, of who trump said “laziness is a trait in black people” is doing them a favor by forcing them to walk to the back of the bus. trump’ deplorable ‘s character is on display for all to see, and his ignorant comments have done him no favors in helping to win over a key constituency he needs to win if he hopes to capture the white house. despite north carolina being the state with the 7th largest black population, there is willy-nilly a black face in the entire crowd. watch all of trump’s heinous speech below, if you must.       trump said blacks are worse than ever under obama. this tweet proves him 100% wrong.      
__label__1 massive protests have broken out in charlotte, north carolina, after police shot and killed disabled african-american man named keith lamont scott, who was apparently reading a book in his car, waiting for his son to come home from school when officers shot him dead. details are still sketchy at the moment, but it appears the police were in search of of another armed man in the area. scott is the sixth civilian shot by charlotte police this year. twelve officers have apparently been injured as tear gas canisters were fired into the crowd. coming so soon after the shooting of terrence crutcher in tulsa, oklahoma, it is clear that all the protests and anger at the disregard for the lives of black americans shown by our police forces have accomplished nothing. scott is the 215th black man shot by police this year. this is an ongoing story that will be updated as new developments occur. charlotte-mecklenburg, nc, police: 12 officers injured in clashes with protesters – @cmpd https://t.co/m5uqbh8v4f — breaking news (@breakingnews) september 21, 2016  #charlotte      breaking: massive protests erupt in north carolina after police kill disabled black man      
__label__1 jimmy kimmel is back with his “lie witness news” segment, in which he submits his subjects to comedic man-on-the-street interviews. in this edition, the kimmel team asked donald trump supporters out in los angeles their opinion on the presidential candidates’ tax return situation. over the past year trump has come under fire for refusing to release his tax returns, defying what has become tradition in presidential elections. the donald claims to be going through some unspecified “audit” causing him to postpone, also making the case that his supporters don’t really care about his tax returns. that’s exactly what kimmel wanted to put to the test, whether his supporters would bat an eyelash in their blind support no matter what the tax returns said. so, in order to see if trump supporters would care at all about the content of trump’s tax return, the kimmel team came up with a bunch of controversial questions to ask about a made up tax return filed by trump that had just come out. “was it legitimate for donald trump to write off his many marriages as “entertainment”? what do you think of donald trump listing his primary occupation as “farmer”? what do you think of donald trump donating $50,000 to subway jared’s legal defense fund?” sure enough, trump supporters were immediately, and without hesitation willing to give him a pass no matter how outlandish or controversial the accusation seemed to be, with answers ranging from “it’s a loophole, if it’s there you’ve gotta utilize it” to “you know, we all kind of fib a little bit.” this goes to show,  sometimes we should be shocked, and outraged when we’re lied to. but nothing will shock trump supporters, and nothing will make trump supporters budge. watch below:       jimmy kimmel gave fake trump tax returns to his supporters, and their responses are terrifying      
__label__1 police brutality has never truly left america’s national conversation, but it had taken a back seat to the presidential election circus until video showed tulsa police shooting and killing terence crutcher in cold blood. it was all too much for one small town ohio police chief, and his moving words have started gone viral on social media according to pinac news: but middletown police chief rodney muterspaw said he could not remain silent after watching tulsa police officer betty shelby shoot and kill terence crutcher, tweeting the following message tuesday, which has been retweeted almost 6,000 times as of this writing. the video showing an oklahoma cop shoot and kill terence crutcher after he had his hands in the air, only to later claim he was not complying, is so outrageous that even an ohio police chief took to social media to voice his disgust. and that is something we never see. according to local media in his hometown of middleton, chief muterspaw wrote on his facebook page that if police officers “can’t do the job or are scared of people different than you, then get out of the job. you are making us all look bad. stop.” “it could be us tomorrow,” muterspaw told the journal-news. “you have to look at it. it’s not second-guessing anybody. it’s training for us. it’s a chance to learn from it. we are not robots. we have an opinion too. if it makes our department better and keeps our officers safer, if it makes the city better we should speak out about it.” he said middletown officers have removed 137 weapons from suspects this year without firing their guns. then he went onto twitter and fired off a pair of tweets heard round the world. here’s the chief’s two public tweets, which were embedded into pinac news’ story before he took his account private after gaining national attention:  the message isn’t resonating in tulsa, where officers have stuck to their hokum story that terence crutcher tried to reach into his car window for a gun – even though a video shows clearly that the window was closed. now officers are trying to slander crutcher claiming that it’s all a drug related issue, an obvious attempt to discredit their dead victim – which curiously, they hadn’t tried to do until his killing gained national attention. in any case, we don’t recall drug posession carrying the death penalty in united states of america, or the suspension of his right to a fair trial. now department of justice officials are going to investigate the tulsa officer who killed crutcher, and with any luck field criminal charges against the cop whose story has frequently changed to desperately try and justify her lethal actions. chief muterspaw’s impassioned call to the professionalism of police, to empathy in their daily life and his commitment to less violent policing is a lesson that one good cop won’t spoil the bunch. sadly, this is newsworthy because he’s quite possibly the only high ranking police official in america who is (or was) openly siding with americans, and siding with citizens right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.      ohio police chief crosses blue line, voices disgust over terence crutcher’s murder

__label__1 over 375 of the world’s leading scientific minds published an open letter on tuesday warning america about the dangers that a donald trump presidency presents to the environment. the republican nominee, who believes that global warming is a hoax created by the chinese, has stated his intention to pull out of the historic paris climate change treaty that president obama signed a few months ago with all 194 other countries in the world. that agreement, expected to be implemented by at least 61 of the world’s worst polluters (accounting for 47% of all emissions), is set to be ratified by the end of the year. the letter, signed by such notable names as stephen hawking and over 30 nobel laureates, paints a bleak picture for our nation if trump is elected and reneges on our international climate treaty obligations. from studies of changes in temperature and sea level over the last million years, we know that the climate system has tipping points. our proximity to these tipping points is uncertain. we know, however, that rapid warming of the planet increases the risk of crossing climatic points of no return, possibly setting in motion large-scale ocean circulation changes, the loss of major ice sheets, and species extinctions. the climatic consequences of exceeding such thresholds are not confined to the next one or two electoral cycles. they have lifetimes of many thousands of years. the political system also has tipping points. thus it is of great concern that the republican nominee for president has advocated u.s. withdrawal from the paris accord. a “parexit” would send a clear signal to the rest of the world: “the united states does not care about the global problem of human-caused climate change. you are on your own.” such a decision would make it far more difficult to develop effective global strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change. the consequences of opting out of the global community would be severe and long-lasting – for our planet’s climate and for the international credibility of the united states. the united states can and must be a major player in developing innovative solutions to the problem of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. nations that find innovative ways of decarbonizing energy systems and sequestering co2 will be the economic leaders of the 21st century. walking away from paris makes it less likely that the u.s. will have a global leadership role, politically, economically, or morally. we cannot afford to cross that tipping point. donald trump, in a nod to the fossil fuel oligarchs that pull the strings of the republican party, complains that the paris agreement “gives foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use right here in america.” that assertion is of course ludicrous; under the paris climate agreement, each country develops its own plan; while countries openly share their progress towards their emission reduction targets with each other, no country can tell another what to do. but what trump is really defending is the ability of multinational energy companies to extract every last ounce of value out the environment and reap as much profit as they can before the consequences of their pyromaniacal carbon frenzy catches up to them. they know the end of their gravy train is coming soon – but if they succeed, it will be far too late for the rest of us. anyone with half a brain can see that month after month brings the highest temperatures ever recorded. only a fool would refuse to acknowledge how storms hit with more fury than they did before; that droughts are longer and wildfires deadlier. natural disasters will increase in intensity and frequency if we continue to pollute as quickly as we do. the wrath of gaia is the biggest threat facing the human race – and we must confront it head on if we want human civilization to survive as we know it. electing donald trump would be the absolute worst thing that we could do for our nation and for the world as a whole. you can read the full letter here.        just in: 375 top scientists pen open letter begging america to not vote trump      
__label__1 it is an inarguable fact that law enforcement in the united states kill far too many citizens. police officers in the united states have killed 706 people in summary executions without due process of the law; well on target to pass last year’s grisly total of 990. our police officers shoot and kill people at a rate seventy times that of other developed countries, and that is absolutely unacceptable. the united kingdom had 55 fatal police shootings in the past 24 years; american police murdered that many citizens in the first 24 days of 2015. the appalling frequency of unarmed black men being gunned down by overzealous police officers who don’t even bother to attempt to take them in peacefully prompts even more questions. why are our cops so trigger-happy? one veteran thinks it may have something to do with their training.  the frequency of violence by american police officers can be partially blamed with the outrageous proliferation of firearms among a irresponsible civilian population leading to more cops being killed in the line of duty, as republican nominee donald trump loves to spout – when he’s not busy telling you how hillary clinton is coming for your guns. but the number of deaths in the line of duty for police officers is down 17% since president obama took office, hovering around 60 a year. police departments cultivate this “shoot first and ask questions later” policy and have developed a wide array of tools to insulate themselves from facing consequences for their crimes. they do this to cover up the fact that the reality is that our police forces receive astonishingly poor training – less than is required to become a cosmetologist. a cosmetologist in alabama requires 50 weeks of training. a soldier in alabama completes ten weeks of basic training and then fifty-two weeks of advanced specialization training. a police officer in alabama requires twelve weeks of training. on the other hand, a police officer in norway requires two years of training. see the difference?      in viral post, iraq vet makes a great point about america’s trigger-happy cops      
__label__1 the hagerstown police department is under heavy fire after a video went viral of officers spraying pepper spray into the back of a police cruiser where a biracial teenage girl was handcuffed, according to herald-mail media. the 15-year-old girl was struck by a car on sunday while riding her bike, after which she hit her head and passed out for half a minute. ambulances were called, but the girl said she didn’t want to go to a hospital. police officers grabbed her off her bike as she tried to ride away and slammed her face into a nearby windowsill, eventually cuffing her hands. panicked, the girl resisted officers as they attempted to push her into the back of the cruiser. she can be heard in the video repeatedly requesting for the presence of a black officer named “zach.” “all we want to do is make sure she’s ok,” one officer tells a bystander, explaining that the girl might have lingering brain damage from the collision. not even a minute later, an officer can be heard telling the girl to “put your feet in the car, ok, or you’re going to get sprayed.” when the frightened girl does not immediately comply, the officers close the door and then spray out their canisters into a crack in the window. the girl can then be heard shrieking in pain, saying “i can’t breathe” multiple times. hagerstown police capt. tom langston only said on wednesday that the department is still investigating. “we’re reviewing the body camera footage,” he said. police have since charged the girl with failure to obey a traffic device, possession of marijuana, two counts of second-degree assault, and disorderly conduct. the girl is reportedly on the honor roll at school and before this incident has never had a criminal record. “the only treatment she got (from police) was slamming, abuse and mace,” said the girl’s family attorney, robin ficker. according to ficker, the pepper spray was not flushed out of her eyes for over three hours, and police requested that hospital staff refrain from taking pictures of her injuries during her stay. the full video of the pepper spraying incident can be found here: posted by robin ficker law offices on tuesday, september 20, 2016            cops caught pepper-spraying handcuffed 15-year-old girl after she was hit by a car (video)      
__label__1 after an exhausting day of ruining the lives of everyday americans, rumor has it republican presidential nominee donald trump likes to curl up in his gold-plated bed and relax with a book by his favorite author – adolf hitler. long before trump began his run for president where racism, bigotry, hatred, division, and fear became the pillars of his campaign he was studying the work of man who is responsible for the third-most murders in human history. according to a 1990 vanity fair article written by marie brenner, trump’s ex-wife ivana, spilled the beans on trump’s love affair with hitler: ivana trump told her lawyer michael kennedy that from time to time her husband reads a book of hitler’s collected speeches, my new order, which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed. kennedy now guards a copy of my new order in a closet at his office, as if it were a grenade. hitler’s speeches, from his earliest days up through the phony war of 1939, reveal his extraordinary ability as a master propagandist. when the pathologically lying trump was confronted about owning the book he feigned ignorance. the interviewer asked him, “did your cousin john give you the hitler speeches?” trump was shocked and attempted to deflect the question by asking a question, “who told you that?” but he then confirmed he owned the book, “actually, it was my friend marty davis from paramount who gave me a copy of “mein kampf”, and he’s a jew.” that trump would even admit to owning the book is bad enough, but his justification for owning the book offers a window into his contorted carnival house of mirrors logic. trump reasons it’s okay to read about hitler hating jews, because his jewish friend gifted it to him, and wouldn’t it be rude to discard the gift without giving it a thorough read? trump lied about lying, as is his standard fare. marty davis did indeed confirm giving trump the book, but it was hitler’s “my jewish order” not “mein kampf.” whether or not that is worse is up for debate. davis went on to say he isn’t jewish, but that he and trump are friends. then, likely after realizing he had outed himself as xenophobic towards jewish people, trump back peddled claiming even if he had hitler’s book he wouldn’t read it. trump said, “if i had these speeches, and i am not saying that i do, i would never read them.” what does he mean he’s not saying he has the speeches? he literally confirmed he had them moments earlier! while it is an exercise in one’s gag reflex to picture trump in bed, it is natural to picture him with a nazi swastika draped over his headboard, while filling his brain with strategies to bamboozle and terrorize the public. trump’s campaign has been ripped from hitler’s playbook of demonizing minorities and blaming them for the ills of a nation, which is all the more reason why trump must be prevented from winning the presidency in less than seven weeks. if trump has been studying hitler for almost 30 years it is too generous of a leap to believe trump was only interested in hitler’s rise to power, and in fact will continue to crib hitler’s strategies if and when he assumes power himself.      horror: in the 90’s, trump kept hitler’s speeches by his bedside      
__label__1 this sunday, san francisco 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick once again knelt in protest of police brutality during the national anthem of another nfl game. the very next day, video of yet another african-american being shot to death by police went viral, notwithstanding the fact that the victim, 40-year-old, terence crutcher, was unarmed and had his hands up at the time of his death. “his car was broken down, he was looking for help and he got murdered,” kaepernick said. “that’s a perfect example of what [my protest] is about. i think it will be very telling what happens with the officers that killed him because everybody’s eyes will be on this.” the day after the footage of crutcher’s murder was released, the response immediately affected charlotte, north carolina as riots spread throughout the area’s poorest neighborhoods. kapernick took to twitter to lament the tragedy and reassert his position, but his argument had already been proven for him in the worst way by police. with his protests, kaepernick originally brought more attention to his disrespect for “the flag” than to police brutality due to the media’s fixation with his kneeling during the national anthem. but the death of terence crutcher served as a reminder of the point, the ruthlessness with which police treat people of color in america. “there’s a lot of racism in this country disguised as patriotism,” kaepernick said, “and people want to take everything back to the flag but that’s not what we’re talking about. we’re talking about racial discrimination, inequalities and injustices that happen across this nation.” according to the guardian, 1,146 people were killed at the hands of the police last year. so far in 2016, police have killed more than 706 people according to the washington post and 790 according to the guardian. and since kaepernick’s protest began, police have killed at least 67 people. of these numbers, an unevenly high percentage of those killed by police have been african-americans. and while the number of incidents with police would suggest a high likelihood of indictment of aggressors, police are almost never convicted of wrongdoing in cases involving police officers, even when there is video evidence of lawbreaking. all of this points away from an isolated event and towards a larger institutional issue with american law enforcement. and as the tally climbs higher every day, it becomes easier and easier to expose the faux-patriotism used to critique of kaepernicks’ protest, as just another way to avoid having a serious conversation about racial injustice in this country and to punish a person of color for daring to question the status quo.      kaepernick calls out critics: stop disguising your racism as patriotism      
__label__1 the protests that shook the city of charlotte last night and injured sixteen police officers have continued into a second night. one person has been shot dead; it is still unclear whether or not the police or a civilian was the shooter. the public displays of frustration over the police shooting of keith lamont scott have mostly been peaceful but certain agitators have been escalating the situation with rocks and looting. the police, in their imposing riot gear and hurling tear gas into the crowds, are not de-escalating matters. the protesters are demanding that the police release the video of the killing of keith lamont scott; the state is responding the only way it knows how – with violence. we hope that protesters will remain peaceful and understand their frustration with the reckless enthusiasm with which american police officers seem to be killing african-american citizens. update: it appears the national guard is on the way. reporter @joebrunowsoc9 says "help is coming from washington" per #charlotte mayor.#charlotteprotest #charlotteuprising #keithscott — andrew westmoreland (@drewwest_press) september 22, 2016  here is a livestream of the incident, courtesy of rt. updates will continue to be posted as they occur. protestors huddle in pkg garage after getting hit by tear gas. pour milk in eyes & mouth. say do not use water in eyes. #charlotteprotest pic.twitter.com/ingqarcenk — heather lacy (@heather_lacy1) september 22, 2016  rt mashablenews: police rush to grab, arrest protester at #charlotteprotest pic.twitter.com/gsyms2srmh — teechip usa (@teechip_usa) september 22, 2016       breaking: one person killed as protests, teargas rock charlotte for a second night (updates)      
__label__1 gq journalist drew magary just penned a brutal takedown of republican nominee donald trump and all of his supporters in an amusing and accurate – if rather profane – fashion. with fury and wit, magary uses to article to exorcize the trump demons in his heart, admitting that “nothing’s gonna take down trump at this point, so i’m not gonna bother. no no, this post is for me. i am preaching to the sad little choir in my soul here.” the torrent of abuse he pours upon trump and his far-right supporters are things that we all would love to scream at every car with a trump sticker on it, at obnoxious twitter handle with a smug pepe the nazi frog winking at you hurling racial slurs at you, every relative who launches into benghazi conspiracies at thanksgiving, at your jaded friend who just “can’t bring himself to vote this year,” at the sycophantic pundits that cut away from the president to a trump rally…this is for all of them. because while trump is a miserable bastard, you are the people who have handed him the bullhorn. you are the people willing to embarrass this nation and put it on the brink of economic ruin all because you wanna throw an electoral hissy fit. you are the people who want to revolutionize the way america does business by voting for its worst businessman, a disgusting neon pig who only makes money when he causes problems for other people instead of solving them. you are the thin-skinned yokels who clutch your bandoliers whenever someone hurls the mildest of slurs at you (“deplorables”), while cheering trump on as he leaves a bonfire of truly hateful invective everywhere he goes. you are the people willing to overlook the fact that trump is an unqualified, ignorant sociopath because durrrr hillary is bad too durrrr.   trump is human waste. he is the worst of america stuffed into a nacho cheese casing, and he is emblematic of the kind of arrogant, flag-waving, trashy, racist moron that the rest of us have to drag kicking and screaming into the 21st century: cliven bundy, sean hannity, kim davis, and on and on and on. trump voters are the people who have spent the past decade or so voting insipid obstructionists into office, sending death threats to anyone who even mentions the idea of gun control, demanding 100% tax cuts on millions of dollars they can only daydream about making, and getting suckered in by any oil party candidate waving a no gays flag. fuck them. these are needy hillbilly loons who are just as starved for attention as trump himself. and voting for trump is their way of emulating him, of saying fuck you to everyone else as a mission statement, with no regard for the fallout.  if you vote for him, you’re not making america great again. you are killing it. you are telling the world that america isn’t worth it. you are telling the world that all of our big talk about freedom and unity and ideals is just a load of shit, and that you would prefer a smoldering dystopia where freedom is just a flimsy cover for evildoing, led by a man who believes that strength is measured only in killing people. you are handing the most important job on earth to napoleon from animal farm. and you are revealing your breathtaking ignorance to everyone except for yourself. i can’t believe you can’t see this. i want you to see this. i wanna shine a big fucking light in your face and scream at you that trump isn’t even qualified to be human, much less president. how are you gonna change the system if you elect some corrupt idiot who has no clue how to do it, huh? can’t you see this? haven’t you heard this asshole talk? the fuck is wrong with you? but i already know that’s a futile effort. so fuck you, and fuck the gop leaders who are too chickenshit to stand up to you. i’m not gonna wish deportation or imprisonment or some kind of fantastical hyperbolic death upon you. i’m not gonna ask for a wall to be built on the mason-dixon line. no no, i think you people deserve the exact same fate as trump himself, and that is to lose, badly. that’s what should happen to you. you and your hamburger puppet leader deserve to live the rest of your days arm-in-arm in disgrace, branded as losers for eternity. because that’s what you are. couldn’t have said it better ourselves. read the full article here.        this journalist’s open letter to trump supporters just set the internet on fire      
__label__1 it’s the nightmare scenario we hope doesn’t happen: on november 8, somewhere around midnight or shortly thereafter, the election returns are finally in from across the nation and it becomes clear that donald j. trump is the next president of the united states. but instead of reaching for your passport and booking an extended vacation to another country, consider what university of utah law professor christopher l. peterson had to say in a paper he just published: even if he were elected, there’s enough evidence already in the matter of trump university to impeach the orange menace before he even raises his hand and takes the oath of office. peterson writes: “in the united states, it is illegal for businesses to use false statements to convince consumers to purchase their services. the evidence indicates that trump university used a systemic pattern of fraudulent representations to trick thousands of families into investing in a program that can be argued was a sham. “fraud and racketeering are serious crimes that legally rise to the level of impeachable acts.”   in the paper, which is titled trump university and presidential impeachment, professor peterson also notes: “somehow in the cacophony of the 2016 presidential campaign, no legal academic has yet turned to the question of whether trump’s alleged behavior would, if proven, rise to the level of impeachable offenses under the impeachment clause of the united states constitution.” so instead of taking up residence at the white house, trump could instead be facing a trial in the senate and another in federal court which could well wind up result in him having to pay back tens of millions of dollars to the very people he cheated with his bogus university. and if he were found guilty of racketeering, trump could even be sent to federal prison where he belongs. hey, donald: don’t get too excited on election night. it may turn out to the beginning of the end for you. featured image via flickr available under a creative commons attribution-sharealike 2.0 generic license      legal expert says trump could be impeached for racketeering before he’s even inaugurated      
__label__1 republican nominee donald trump’s ohio chairwoman recently took it upon herself to prove to the world just how delusional the right-wing in america really is when kathy miller told reporters that racism in america didn’t exist until president obama. “i don’t think there was any racism until obama got elected. we never had problems like this … now, with the people with the guns, and shooting up neighborhoods, and not being responsible citizens, that’s a big change, and i think that’s the philosophy that obama has perpetuated on america. growing up as a kid, there was no racism, believe me. we were just all kids going to school.” this perfectly illustrates how the right-wing digs their mental bogs of ignorance – blame obama for literally everything; absolve self/race/identity group of all responsibility, then construct pleasant fantasy. supporting her candidate’s constant efforts to sabotage what little support he has within the african-american community, she then went on to say that black americans are responsible for the decades of their socioeconomic disenfranchisement by saying that “if you’re black and you haven’t been successful in the last 50 years, it’s your own fault. you’ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. you’ve had the same schools everybody else went to. you had benefits to go to college that white kids didn’t have. you had all the advantages and didn’t take advantage of it. it’s not our fault, certainly.” to put a big white cherry on this perverse cake of racism, she then felt the need to add that “the black lives matter movement is a stupid waste of time” and that low voter turnout is probably related to how black americans “were raised.” in one fell swoop, this woman has erased four hundred years of slavery, segregation and the jim crow era, the widespread lynchings of black americans by radical christian terrorist organizations like the ku klux klan, the ghettoization of the inner cities, mass incarceration and the war on drugs, and the wholesale slaughter of black americans by law enforcement from the record. instead, she is blaming the only black president our nation has ever had, when in reality it was his election that brought all the racism to the surface. she is echoing sentiments shared by a large portion of the american population which has been either brainwashed by media narratives or too ignorant know any better, but it shows just how large a divide we face in try to engage with people so entirely divorced from reality. when the daft old woman was informed that this might sound offensive to some people, she replied “i don’t care, it’s the truth.” the trump campaign in a nutshell, ladies and gentlemen. update: kathy miller has resigned her from her position with the trump campaign and has issued an apology. it should be noted the trump campaign has yet to apologize for anything this campaign season. watch it here – her remarks begin at 4:40:       unhinged: trump campaign chair says racism didn’t exist before obama in viral rant      
__label__1 in yet another of the disturbing islamophobic attacks occuring more and more frequently in the united states, a man in northern philadelphia (dauphin and cleveland streets) is wanted for throwing a firebomb into an occupied car. the assailant allegedly screamed “there you go, muslim!” as he hurled what is assumed to be an  improvised incendiary device into the vehicle. the victim was rushed to the hospital and is being treated for severe burns. the fearmongering rhetoric of donald trump and the far-right wing has lead to an appalling uptick in anti-muslim attacks, the frequency of which increased by a staggering 87.5% after republican nominee donald trump called for a ban on muslims entering the united states. such heinous attacks only serve to divide us and make us less safe. it intensifies the perception that muslims are not welcome in the united states, and it is precisely that kind of alienation that creates fertile ground for predatory radicals to work their pernicious evil. jihadi propaganda relies on the central argument that western “crusader” culture despises muslims and that islamic culture is incompatible with the west; these kind of attacks only prove their point. that’s why donald trump has been featured in recruitment videos from brutal jihadi groups like daesh (isis/isil) and somalia’s al-shabaab. former cia director michael hayden explained that “when mr. trump says some of the things that he has said — ‘they all hate us,’ ‘we shouldn’t let any of those people in our country’ — what he does is underscore and underpin the fundamentals of [the isis] narrative of undying enmity. we don’t have radicalized communities in the united states. we have some radicalized individuals, but we have it fully within our ability to create radicalized communities, and that kind of rhetoric … actually bends you in the direction of radicalizing communities.” unless we want the plague of terrorism to spread in the united states, we must be inclusionary and accepting, manifesting the values of tolerance and pluralism that our country was founded on. we cannot  allow the rabble-rousing ramblings of a bigot to put the lives of our citizens in danger. police are still searching for a suspect. here’s a video of the aftermath, courtesy of @feministajones:       just in: man screams “there you go, muslim!” as he throws firebomb into car      
__label__1 last night, the city of charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of kenneth l. scott. during the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. the police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying – and that the shot came from law enforcement. one key eye witness report emerged from charlotte on twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from todd zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: “i didn’t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. let the record show.” my friend @neutralized was on the ground in charlotte. he saw the shooting. here's his account. pic.twitter.com/h5cqxran37 — max berger (@maxberger) september 22, 2016  we interviewed kahran meyer, who is a north carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. the 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm: i watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. it was not by a civilian. i don't care what cnn tells you. i was right fucking there. — paid leave (@kahranasaurus) september 22, 2016  “i didn’t realize that i was standing next to someone from cnn at the time. it started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let’s march to the police station. it was peaceful, people had signs that said “hands up, don’t shoot,” kahran meyers told me at 1:50am tonight. “the protest then marched to college street and trade street in front of the omni hotel. at that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,” meyer told me almost breathlessly, “i’ve been told that the idea was to walk into the omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. we wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.” “after leaving ‘the epicenter,’ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. at that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful – and that’s when the riot police arrived. i swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.” meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. the charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, “oh, absolutely.” five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street. “it wasn’t a gunshot,” she told us. “it was much louder. it wasn’t a civilian injury. the way people scattered. no way. at least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‘they just shot him’ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. at that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn’t already left, exited.” at that moment, meyers says that charlotte-mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. as she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters. it took meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. according to meyer, that videographer was from cnn and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‘entirely too loud for a gunshot too. it was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.’ cnn reports, “police say the person was shot by a civilian.” the city of charlotte began spinning the protester’s grave injuries immediately on twitter: alert: fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @cmpd did not fire shot. — city of charlotte (@cltgov) september 22, 2016  two additional eye witness reports have emerged on twitter refute the charlotte police’s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. the first is from the charlotte clergy coalition for justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed palestinian rights activist. “i saw the man go down on the pavement,” said minister steve knight of missiongathering christian church in charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at charlotte-meckenberg police for the shooting, “it was an ambush. the victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.” #charlotte clergy question

__label__1 the police officer who shot unarmed motorist terence crutcher has been charged with first-degree manslaughter and a warrant has been issued for her arrest. crutcher had been driving home from community college when his suv broke down. officer betty shelby, who has a past history of domestic violence and drug abuse, was on her way to answer a domestic dispute when she encountered crutcher and the suv. she stopped, initiated the confrontation with crutcher, and shot him dead, even though he clearly has his hands up and was unarmed. her radio communications show that she called him a “bad dude” even though there was no reason to do so. while the charges are a good sign that justice will be carried out, we must remember that not a single police officer was convicted of unlawfully killing a civilian last year. nor were any convicted in 2014. since 2005, only thirteen cops have been brought to justice for executing civilians. “juries and judges seem reluctant to second-guess the split-second life or death decisions of police officers in violent street encounters in the course of their job … and will give the benefit of every doubt to an officer on trial in these cases” says criminology professor phillip stintson.   we’d appreciate it if they began to give the people they ostensibly are “protecting and serving” the same benefit of the doubt. here is video of the shooting. viewer discretion is advised; as police chief chuck jordan remarked, “it is very disturbing.”      breaking: officer who shot terence crutcher charged with manslaughter      
__label__1 legendary singer barbara streisand penned an op-ed for the huffington post today in which she paints a distinct portrait between republican nominee donald trump and democratic nominee hillary clinton, disparaging the mandarin mogul for his cowardice and bigotry while praising the former secretary of state for her strength and resolve. he’s basically a bully, but like all bullies, he’s a coward at heart. he skipped out on a debate because he didn’t like the moderator. he can’t handle the tough questions. he’s so thin-skinned that as soon as anyone challenges him, he sues them. hillary has been attacked right and left for decades and is still standing. she has negotiated with leaders around the world to keep us safe from nuclear threat because it would destroy the planet… while he shockingly said, “if we have nuclear weapons, why can’t we use them?” and he has the nerve to call her “trigger-happy”? “unstable”? his ignorance is astounding. streisand then touches on the undercurrent of sexism that has dogged the clinton campaign and her entire political career, rightfully pointing out that old white men are deeply suspicious of powerful women, afraid they will be treated the way that they treat women. so how come hillary is not getting credit for all her accomplishments? it goes back to something i’ve felt for many years…strong women, powerful women have always been suspect. some men are challenged by strong women… afraid of them… and some women are jealous of them. strong women have too many opinions for some people… they prefer women who are quiet. they want us to speak less and smile more. after hillary answered questions on national security, reince priebus complained that she didn’t smile enough. well, guess what… there was nothing to smile about. as she said, this is serious business. and trump says hillary doesn’t look presidential? what does that mean… coming from a guy who looks like a raccoon in a tanning bed… with a flying squirrel on his head? that’s what a president is supposed to look like? a wrestler who dies his hair blonde? republicans play dirty and their smear tactics unfortunately work. as they say, “if you repeat a lie long enough and loud enough, people will believe it.” and that’s what’s happening and it’s terrifying. we can’t allow ourselves to be swiftboated again. we can’t let that happen to hillary… a woman who has the temperament and the experience to be president… unlike donald trump, whose idea of foreign policy was bringing the miss universe pageant to russia. how can you support a man who says, “women… you have to treat them like sh—“ and believes such hateful things about 51 percent of the american population? we cannot allow america to fall into the hands of a narcissist who has shown no regard for anyone but himself… a bigoted and misogynist reality-tv character with no political experience and no qualms about lying loudly and often. there is no equivalency between these two candidates. only hillary clinton has the skills, the knowledge, the temperament and the compassion to lead this nation. she’s absolutely right. donald trump is the complete opposite of everything our nation stands for, while hillary clinton embodies leadership and strength in an obvious way that must make trump feel like a chump with tiny hands.      just in: barbara streisand pens scathing op-ed blasting “coward” trump      
__label__0 the obama administration monday is calling on cities and counties to rethink their zoning laws, saying that antiquated rules on construction, housing and land use are contributing to high rents and income inequality, and dragging down the u.s. economy as a whole. city zoning battles usually are fought block by block, and the president's involvement will create friction, particularly among environmental groups and the not-in-my-backyard crowd. but the white house jawboning is welcome news to many others, including mayors and builders increasingly foiled by community opposition to development. story continued below the white house published a “toolkit” of economic evidence and policy fixes to help local political leaders fight back against the nimbys that tend to hold sway over municipal zoning meetings. “in more and more regions across the country, local and neighborhood leaders have said yes in our backyard,” the paper states. “we need to break down the rules that stand in the way of building new housing.” the prescriptions call for more density, speedier permitting and fewer restrictions on accessory dwelling units such as basement and garage apartments. the plan rejects some of the arguments made by environmentalists, labor unions and other liberal constituencies that have stood in the way of development and endorses changes long sought by builders and the business community. “when unnecessary barriers restrict the supply of housing and costs increase, then workers, particularly lower-income workers who would benefit the most, are less able to move to high-productivity cities,” said jason furman, chairman of the council of economic advisers. “all told, this means slower economic growth.” zoning policy might seem picayune for a president, but eight years after the foreclosure crisis left the country littered with empty homes, the country is facing a critical housing shortage in its most vibrant job centers. the result is soaring rents, growing income inequality and sputtering economic growth nationwide. by one estimate, barriers to development in major cities have shaved as much as $1.95 trillion a year off u.s. economic growth. “it’s important that the president is talking about it,” said mark calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the cato institute. “local restrictions on housing supply are a crucial economic issue. i would say it’s one of the top 10.” there’s not much the white house can do beyond talk. the administration’s 2017 budget request includes $300 million in grants to help mayors update zoning rules, and the department of transportation has begun weighing plans for housing growth and affordability before approving funding for certain transit projects. despite a growing consensus among economists that slow-growth policies of the 1970s are hurting job and income growth, many elected officials continue to face local opposition to liberalized development. earlier this year, environmentalists and labor unions quickly shut down a plan by california gov. jerry brown that would have made it easier for developers to build apartments and condominiums. the proposal got nowhere, despite the support of mayors, businesses and the white house. the case illustrates the steep road to change and the need for high-profile jawboning, calabria said. “normally governors don’t like to get involved in local land-use decisions,” calabria said. “and if you have a president talking about it, that’s unusual.”      obama takes on zoning laws in bid to build more housing, spur growth      
__label__0 the new york times on monday urged undecided voters to rethink their consideration of donald trump for president, warning them of supporting a candidate “far more consumed with himself than with the nation’s well-being.” days after endorsing hillary clinton’s presidential campaign, the newspaper issued a scathing rebuke of the republican presidential nominee — hours ahead of his first one-on-one debate with clinton. story continued below in an editorial published monday, the times’ editorial board reminds voters that the real estate mogul began his campaign 15 months ago offering “wealth and television celebrity as credentials, then slyly added a list of fearmongering about mexican ‘rapists’ flooding across the southern border.” “from that moment of combustion, it became clear that mr. trump’s views were matters of dangerous impulse and cynical pandering rather than thoughtful politics,” the board wrote. “yet he has attracted throngs of americans who ascribe higher purpose to him than he has demonstrated in a freewheeling campaign marked by bursts of false and outrageous allegations, personal insults, xenophobic nationalism, unapologetic sexism and positions that shift according to his audience and his whims.” now is the time for undecided voters — as well as those “hoping for some dramatic change in our politics and governance,” the board said — “to take a hard look and see mr. trump for who he is. they have an obligation to scrutinize his supposed virtues as a refreshing counterpolitician. otherwise, they could face the consequences of handing the white house to a man far more consumed with himself than with the nation’s well-being.” from his business “record rife with bankruptcies and sketchy ventures” to his refusal to release his tax returns to his embrace of russian strongman vladimir putin and potential business ties to the kremlin, the times outlined “how mr. trump is selling himself and why he can’t be believed.” the list includes trump’s waffling on policy issues, his intimation that he might try to persuade creditors to accept less than the u.s. government owes and a tax-cut plan that would cost trillions of dollars in revenue, among others. the times mocks what it calls his ludicrous secret plan to destroy the islamic state, noting that trump has no national security experience and bobs and weaves on whether he would commit ground troops, and insists his heart lies “with the anti-immigrant, nativist and racist signals that he scurrilously employed to build his base.” “a change agent for the nation and the world?” an italicized subhead reads. “there can be little doubt of that. but voters should be asking themselves if mr. trump will deliver the kind of change they want,” the times cautions. adding that voters should be wary of trump’s “silence about areas of national life that are crying out for constructive change,” such as schools, poverty and racial progress, the times concludes: “voters attracted by the force of the trump personality should pause and take note of the precise qualities he exudes as an audaciously different politician: bluster, savage mockery of those who challenge him, degrading comments about women, mendacity, crude generalization about nations and religions. our presidents are role models for generations of our children. is this the example we want for them?”      nyt to undecided voters: don't hand trump the white house      
__label__0 monday night’s debate between hillary clinton and donald trump will be a battle of facts—and, perhaps more likely, half-facts and flat-out lies. both candidates, after all, have called out for being exceptionally untrustworthy in a profession that’s not known for its uprightness. at the new yorker, david remnick has said of clinton, “[she] has had her bald-faced moments—moments that are too kindly described as ‘lawyerly,’” while nicholas kristof recently wrote, “if deception were a sport, trump would be the olympic gold medalist.” when number crunchers are on the case, the candidates don’t fare much better: politico magazine recently fact-checked a week’s worth of each candidate’s statements, and found that trump had uttered one untruth every 3.25 minutes and clinton, every 12 minutes. in fact, just half of clinton’s factual assertions have been found to be “true” or “mostly true” by the nonpartisan fact-checkers at politifact, and trump’s statements only come in at a pitiful 15 percent. little wonder that polling shows more than half of likely voters don’t think either candidate is honest, the highest level of distrust in recent elections. story continued below this heightened concern about truthfulness has prompted heated conversations about whether debate moderators should be responsible for live fact-checking. (clinton says yes, trump no.) but viewers can prepare themselves regardless: knowing that we’re in for gale-force fabrications on monday, how can you steel yourself for the lies ahead? todd rogers, an associate professor of public policy at the harvard kennedy school, has published two major studies about deception and how audiences respond to it. he has identified five tactics that are mainstays in american politics—and why they often work on us. here’s a guide to those five types of deception and how they’ve been deployed in recent political history. 1. artful dodging what it is: answering a different question than the one that was asked—not quite a lie, but an evasion. when you’ve seen it: nearly all political debates feature at least one dodge, also known as a “pivot.” in one republican primary debate, trump was asked, “do you still believe president bush should have been impeached?”—to which his response started, “first of all, i have to say, as a businessman i get along with everybody. i have business all over the world.” (the rest of his response didn’t answer the question either.) in one of clinton’s primary debates, she avoided a direct answer about the content of her goldman sachs speeches even when pressed. why it works: rogers has found that viewers’ limited attention is tied up in deciding whether they like a candidate, not whether the candidate is actually responding to the question. since many dodges go undetected, candidates don’t often lose points for them. in fact, in the same study, speakers who eloquently answered a similar question were rated as highly as those who inartfully answered the actualquestion. 2. paltering what it is: actively using truthful statements to lead a listener to a false conclusion. when you’ve seen it: the best-known political example is probably bill clinton’s line during an interview about the monica lewinsky scandal: “there is no sexual relationship with that woman,” a sly but truthful use of the present tense to obscure past misdeeds. (five days later, he upgraded to full-blown lie with “i did not have sexual relations with that woman.”) trump has also used this tactic when asked about the bankruptcy of trump entertainment resorts: “seven years ago, i left atlantic city before it totally cratered, and i made a lot of money in atlantic city.” the facts are true, but the statement misleadingly recasts a business failure in a positive light. why it works: paltering is hard to pick up on, since you’re technically hearing the truth. and rogers’ research shows that even when outside observers know it’s happening, they consider it more benign than outright lies of commission (see below). 3. explicit avoidance what it is: flat-out refusing to engage with a sticky subject. when you’ve seen it: politicians use this tactic when they refuse to release their tax returns, like trump, or medical records, like hillary clinton. more often, you see it when politicians or their spokespeople employ the classic “no comment,” or a similar sentiment, as when bernie sanders responded to a question about the failures of venezuela’s socialist model with: “of course i have an opinion, but as i said, i’m focused on my campaign.” clinton has done him one better, refusing for much of the campaign to face the press at all (and earning considerable criticism for it). why it works: actually, it doesn’t. rogers’ colleagues have demonstrated that listeners trust and prefer people who reveal to people who hide, even when the information is damaging. 4. lying by commission what it is: saying something you know to be untrue in order to mislead your audience. when you’ve seen it: politicians most often employ straight-up lies when denying involvement in a scandal. see: anthony weiner’s initial denial that he’d sent anyone a close-up photo of his underwear,saying, “this was a prank, a hoax.” or the response by congressman mark foley’s camp to allegations that he’d sent inappropriate messages to congressional pages: “[this is part of an] an ugly smear campaign.” in this election cycle, trump has famously clung to the false assertion that he always opposed the iraq war. why it works: this tactic can backfire if detected—both weiner and foley resigned under pressure, after all. but plenty of political mistruths have remarkable staying power even after being debunked, like claims, long disseminated by trump, that barack obama is a muslim or was born in kenya. 5. lying by omission what it is: failing to disclose a piece of relevant information or context, which renders a statement untrue. when you’ve seen it: in promoting the affordable care act, barack obama and his team made a number of statements like, “if you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.” this wasn’t strictly true—you could only keep your plan if it hadn’t changed since the aca was passed. more recently, trump has trumpeted the virtues of american manufacturing while failing to mention that several trump products are made overseas. and clinton’s handling of her private email server could be viewed as one extended lie of omission, since she and her team have provided incomplete information and records on multiple occasions. why it works: if the public believes something untrue but desirable about a candidate, failure to correct the misperception works in the candidate’s favor. and research has suggested that people prefer tellinglies of omission to lies of commission. not only is the former therefore more common—it’s also harder to hold people accountable for something they didn’t say than something they did. still, lies of omission can work against candidates if audiences suspect they’re not being told the whole story. of course, lies of omission are designed not to de detected—just like other forms of deception. but by studying up on rogers’ taxonomy of deceit, perhaps debate viewers will better be able to pick up on any misleading tactics the candidates choose to deploy.      5 ways candidates mislead you in debates      
__label__0 hours ahead of its face-off with hillary clinton on monday night, donald trump’s campaign suggested that it won’t be treated fairly in the aftermath, surmising that headlines have already been written before either candidate has taken the stage. “i’m worried, mika, about not being treated fairly afterwards. i’m worried that some of the headlines are already written, that they’re conclusions in search of evidence,” trump campaign manager kellyanne conway told msnbc’s “morning joe” co-hosts mika brzezinski and joe scarborough in an interview monday morning. “you saw — and others were talking about it in the earlier segment — that this weekend was spent by editorial writers and people on twitter and elsewhere really just trying to undercut donald trump before the debate.” story continued below those same people, conway continued, are “somehow putting the burden on the media to prop up hillary clinton and pregame the debate,” adding, “that’s not the role of the media.” scarborough interjected, remarking that “it’s almost like they don’t think hillary clinton is strong enough to do it on her own.” “that’s the key,” conway said. “we can scream bias and unfairness, but what joe just said is really the key here, that they’re worried about her debating skills.” conway, a pollster who was promoted to run the third iteration of the real estate mogul’s campaign, said despite clinton’s participation in nearly three dozen debates, “there’s no connection that we can see between her debate performances and any type of major lift in the polls thereafter, and i think they know that over in brooklyn.” but trump’s biggest problem monday night will be what barack obama said during his bitter 2008 primary battle against clinton: that she’ll say anything to get elected, conway said. “so if she ends up saying to him, ‘that’s just not true, you’re distorting my record, you’re being mean to a woman,’ and then people will say, ‘he was mean to a woman,’ and the headlines will scream and twitter will blow up — even if it’s not true,” she said. “so that would be my concern, that he’s not able to get out all of his responses because, as joe correctly points out, people are so worried that she’s not a great debater, that she’s not really ready for tonight the way he is, that she’s going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage.”      trump campaign worried he won't be treated fairly post-debate      
__label__0 the race for the white house is essentially tied heading into tonight’s presidential debate, yet another national poll released on monday shows. according to the latest quinnipiac national poll, hillary clinton leads donald trump 44 percent to 43 percent among likely voters in a four-way race, with 8 percent supporting libertarian nominee gary johnson and 1 percent backing the green party candidate jill stein. story continued below in a two-way race, clinton leads trump by a similar margin, 47 percent to 46 percent. the poll shows little change since quinnipiac’s september survey, when clinton led trump 41-39 percent in a four-way race. while clinton leads among women 47 percent to 42 percent, trump holds a similar advantage among men, 44 percent to 40 percent. independents also favor trump, as well as white voters, though non-white voters overwhelmingly prefer clinton. eight-four percent of respondents plan to tune into monday’s primetime debate, which 41 percent of likely voters expect clinton to win (32 percent said trump will win the debate). the quinnipiac poll mirrors recent national and swing state surveys that have shown a tightening race, including a national bloomberg poll in which trump narrowly leads by 2 percentage points and cnn/orc surveys of pennsylvania and colorado that show a virtual tie. polling averages still show a slight clinton lead: realclearpolitics has her 2.1 points ahead, while huffpollster has her leading trump by 4 points. fivethirtyeight has clinton up by 1.1 points. according to politico’s average of battleground state polls, clinton’s lead is 2.8 points in the 11 states most likely to decide the electoral college vote. for monday’s poll, quinnipiac surveyed 1,115 likely voters by landline and telephone from sept. 22-25, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points.      clinton, trump running neck-and-neck in new national poll      
__label__0 hillary clinton’s campaign is hoping lester holt is no matt lauer. clinton campaign manager robby mook told “cbs this morning” that his expectation for holt on monday night, when clinton and donald trump square off in the first presidential debate, is that he call out trump’s lies. lauer was assailed by his colleagues in the media for allowing trump’s assertion that he didn’t support the iraq war go unchecked during nbc’s commander in chief forum earlier this month. story continued below “we’re really focused on this opportunity that hillary has to speak directly to the voters on the issues,” mook said in an interview monday morning. “but we are concerned that donald trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish.” asked what he expects the moderator to do, mook said “all that we’re asking is that the record be checked.” “so if donald trump lies, which he has repeatedly done in the past, that that be simply checked,” he said.      clinton camp asks lester holt to fact-check trump tonight      
__label__0 while donald trump will top expectations, hillary clinton’s challenge in monday night’s debate is to become human, former trump campaign manager corey lewandowski said monday. “what hillary clinton has to do here is she has to become human, and i mean that in a good way,” lewandowski, a paid cnn contributor who is still getting severance from the trump campaign, said monday morning during a panel discussion. “she has to connect with people because i think what happens is people see her as — look, she knows the issues. there’s no question about that, but what she doesn’t have is that compassion that people see, and i think if she’s gonna be successful tonight, she has to relate to people on a different level, and the expectation of donald trump as not preparing, i think he’ll exceed that expectation.” story continued below lewandowski pushed back on the notion that trump won’t be prepared for his prime-time faceoff with clinton at hofstra university in new york, noting that a similar narrative of an ill-prepared trump played out during the republican primary debates, yet the real estate mogul was actually “very prepared” and “dominated” his rivals. “look, i think it’s the same preparation that he’s using now,” lewandowski said of trump’s primary debate prep, “which is conversation, talking with experts in their respective fields, understanding the issues, making sure he’s got briefing documents on issues that he wants to know more about, but he’s also prepared for the last 40 years of his life, and, you know, getting ready for a day like this is a big day for anybody. you got 100 million people, potentially, who are gonna tune in, and one of the next two people who’s gonna be president of the united states is gonna be standing on that stage tonight. i think it’s a big day for everybody.”      lewandowski: clinton has to become human      
__label__0 president barack obama mourned the death of golf legend arnold palmer in a statement released monday, celebrating him as “the american dream come to life.” palmer, widely regarded as one of golf’s greatest stars, died sunday in pittsburgh at the age of 87. he won seven major tournaments over the course of his career, including four masters tournaments, and 65 wins on the pga tour rank him 5th all-time on that list. he was awarded the presidential medal of freedom in 2004 by president george w. bush and the congressional gold medal in 2009. story continued below “with his homemade swing and homespun charm, arnold palmer had swagger before we had a name for it,” the president said in a statement released by the white house. “from a humble start working at the local club in his beloved latrobe, pennsylvania, to superstardom as the face of golf around the globe, arnold was the american dream come to life.” "along the way he racked up win after win – but it wasn’t his success that made him king. arnold’s freewheeling, fearless approach to the game inspired a generation of golfers and, for the first time on tv, enthralled an audience across the world. sure, we liked that he won seven majors, but we loved that he went for it when he probably should have laid up,” obama, himself an avid golfer, continued. “that spirit extended beyond the links where he gave freely of himself and poured everything he had into everything he did: from building hospitals to personally responding to countless letters from his fans. and he did it all with a grin that hinted maybe he had one more shot up his sleeve."      obama: 'arnold palmer had swagger before we had a name for it'      
__label__0 donald trump will detail his plan to destroy the islamic state during monday night’s debate against hillary clinton — if asked, according to his campaign manager. asked by willie geist during msnbc’s “morning joe” whether trump will offer specifics beyond his broad statement that he will “knock the hell out of isis,” trump campaign manager kellyanne conway replied in the affirmative. story continued below “he certainly has a plan. i’ve heard it,” conway said. “this is his debate tonight, willie, he’ll tell you if that question is asked. but there’s also — you know, people are just amazed that hillary clinton would put on her campaign website what her plan to defeat isis is. is it that isis can’t read that plan?” trump has vowed to “knock the hell out of isis” but has been mum on how he would do so, suggesting that he doesn’t want to tip his hand to the terrorist network. pressed by geist and mika brzezinski on whether voters deserve to know details about his plan before they cast their votes, or at least a sense that he has any “knowledge of the landscape,” conway said, “yes, and he’ll be happy to offer those specifics without telling the enemy exactly what we’re going to do.” “so just to put a button on it, we’ll get the isis plan tonight in the debate?” geist asked. “you will get his view of how best to defeat the enemy without telling isis particularly, specifically what it’s going to be,” she said.      conway: trump will explain his islamic state plan if asked      
__label__0 hillary clinton and donald trump are virtually tied in pennsylvania and colorado, according to cnn/orc polls of the battleground states released monday. clinton and trump are separated by a single point in both states — well within the margin of error — with clinton’s advantage coming in pennsylvania while trump leads in colorado. clinton tops the field in a four-way matchup in pennsylvania with 45 percent support to trump’s 44 percent. libertarian nominee gary johnson follows with 6 percent support, while green party nominee jill stein sits at 3 percent, among likely voters. in colorado, it’s trump who leads the field, with 42 percent support, followed by clinton at 41 percent, johnson at 13 percent and stein at 3 percent. in a head-to-head, though, clinton holds narrow advantages over trump in both states. she leads trump 50 percent to 47 percent among likely voters in pennsylvania and 49 percent to 47 percent in colorado. the polls come hours ahead of monday night’s presidential debate between clinton and trump. while nearly 8-in-10 voters in pennsylvania and colorado said they’ve already made their minds up on who they will vote for in november, more than 20 percent in each state said they could change their mind, suggesting monday’s performance could impact the race. the surveys of 771 likely pennsylvania voters and 784 likely colorado voters were conducted sept. 20-25 via landline and cellphone. they have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.      new poll has clinton, trump in virtual dead heat in colorado, pennsylvania      
__label__0 hillary clinton’s campaign is making one plea ahead of monday night’s big debate: don’t let donald trump get away with it. and trump’s campaign is firing right back, arguing that the press is biased against the republican nominee and, in any case, clinton’s team is just trying to “game the refs.” story continued below the debate is playing out against a backdrop of polls that indicate a tightening white house race, with trump drawing even or ahead in national and battleground-state surveys. polling averages now show that clinton’s post-convention lead has evaporated, and no less a guru than nate silver declared on monday morning that the race is a “dead heat.” “the latest polling is consistent with a clinton lead of only ~1% nationally. state firewall breaking up. trend lines awful,” silver tweeted. during the critical hours of expectation-setting ahead of the 9 p.m. showdown at hofstra university, both camps claimed their candidate would be held to an unfair standard, with clinton’s aides explicitly requesting that moderator lester holt fact-check trump in real time. “we are concerned that donald trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish,” clinton campaign manager robby mook told “cbs this morning,” adding that all the campaign is asking of holt is that if trump lies, “that that simply be checked.” “the thing that concerns us is not the moderator themselves, who have been selected by the commission, because they will be seen as fair and even-handed. what bothers us, mark, is the very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs," trump campaign manager kellyanne conway shot back in an interview on msnbc. but conway was soon put in the awkward position of defending trump’s claim that holt may be unfair to him because he’s a democrat and the system is “very unfair.” the “nbc nightly news” anchor has been a registered republican in new york since 2003. “i don’t know that he knew what lester holt’s voter registration was,” said conway, who went on to dodge multiple queries of why trump lied. “he didn’t lie,” conway said at one point, explaining that “a lie would mean that he knew the man’s party registration.” in a presidential cycle that’s seen endless debates about debates, monday’s theme was conflicting interpretations of what it means to be a moderator. after suggesting a debate with no moderator, trump has already signaled to holt that he shouldn’t try to be candy crowley, who famously injected herself into the 2012 presidential debate between president barack obama and mitt romney with a fact-check of the gop nominee. but clinton’s campaign has beat up on holt’s nbc colleague matt lauer, who was widely panned in the media for allowing trump’s false assertion that he didn’t support the iraq war go unchecked during a national security forum earlier this month. the nonpartisan commission on presidential debates, which selected the debate sites and moderators, weighed in sunday. “in our history, the moderators have found it appropriate to let the candidates be the ones that talk about the accuracy or the fairness of what the other candidate or candidates might have said,” janet brown, the commission’s executive director, told cnn’s “reliable sources.” when it comes to fact-checking, brown warned, “i don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the encyclopedia britannica.” for her part, clinton won’t let trump’s lies “go by the wayside,” press secretary brian fallon told cnn on monday, insisting that holt shouldn’t, either. “there is enough lies that donald trump tells consistently that everyone, by now, should be able to call them out,” he said. “lester holt, hillary clinton will, too, but i think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching that are grading the two candidates’ performances should take it into account. by now, we all know he likes to lie about his record when it comes to the iraq war, he lies about his support for the intervention in libya, he lies about who started birtherism, he lies on any different number of issues and he tells them so frequently that we all know them now. if he says them again, that should be disqualifying. he can’t possibly be given a passing grade if he repeats those lies.” former trump campaign manager corey lewandowski, a paid cnn contributor who is still receiving severance from the trump campaign, dismissed the idea that a fact-checking moderator is of any concern. “i think what the concern is from both of the campaigns — and what it should be — is that the moderator is not the person who’s running for president of the united states. so i think you let the candidates debate, you let the candidates answer,” he said. “you can hold people accountable, there’s no question, but i don’t think it’s the role of the moderator to inject themselves in so they’re making themselves part of the debate structure and people are talking about the moderator after the debate.” trump’s campaign, including his former aide lewandowski, also pushed the narrative that clinton is robotic. that charge was leveled in response to the clinton camp’s preparation for two trumps. “we don’t want donald trump’s lies and distortions to be a distraction. we’re hoping that can get checked so that hillary can focus her time on what she wants to do,” mook told nbc’s “today.” asked about clinton’s rules of engagement versus trump, mook added that “it just depends on what donald trump shows up to the debate, and we just don’t know that.” but conway shot down the notion that there’s any other trump, while echoing the criticism that the former secretary of state lacks human compassion. lewandowski cast clinton as a policy wonk whose challenge is “to become human” during the debate, senior communications adviser jason miller tweeted that “overprogramming leads to short circuits,” and conway joined the pile-on. “he’s not going to be robotic and scripted. hillary clinton is,” conway said. “and that’s a problem in debates likes this because people want to see a future commander in chief and president of the united states who is nimble and resilient and can answer questions that haven’t been pre-programmed in their head through all this secretive debate prep and mock debates.” after mook warned against “a double standard where donald trump can get the most improved award but hillary clinton, you know, is getting judged on the fine points of policy,” conway added that the two campaign managers “are living in parallel universes.” “i mean, donald trump has been criticized all weekend long. i think that the clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs, has been talking to the media for a week now saying it’s your job to make sure that donald trump is fact-checked in real-time,” she said. “i'm just surprised a campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. but look, they know that campaign debates are not hillary clinton's sweet spot. yes, she's experienced at doing them, but the experience hasn’t necessarily been beneficial.” aside from how holt will moderate, conway cited pre-written narratives and what she claimed was clinton’s willingness to say anything to get elected as her top concerns. “i’m worried that some of the headlines are already written, that they’re conclusions in search of evidence,” conway said, adding that newspapers and reporters have already begun trying to undercut trump ahead of the debate. “what i would ask you all to do is start looking at the twitter feeds of, quote, objective reporters, particularly our embeds. these are not profiles in courage, and this is not journalism. there are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on twitter,” conway said. “ninety-two percent of at least two of our embeds’ tweets are negative towards donald trump. why are they on our campaign plane? why are they covering our campaign? ... excuse the trump campaign if we feel like we can’t get a fair shake from certain people.” conway also indicated that clinton may play the woman card, skewing headlines that take away from the real estate mogul’s performance. “so if she ends up saying to him, ‘that’s just not true, you’re distorting my record, you’re being mean to a woman,’ and then people will say, ‘he was mean to a woman,’ and the headlines will scream and twitter will blow up — even if it’s not true,” she said. “so that would be my concern, that he’s not able to get out all of his responses because, as joe [scarborough] correctly points out, people are so worried that she’s not a great debater, that she’s not really ready for tonight the way he is, that she’s going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage.” rudy giuliani, the former new york mayor and a prominent trump surrogate, said he had advised trump to "just let loose" and be himself — and not try to compete with clinton's detailed policy expertise. "she's been in government since i was a child. i don't remember a time she hasn't been in government in one way or another," giuliani said on "fox and friends." "so she's going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has, but i think he's going to comport himself very, very well, and he's going to be — he's just going to be like you see him on — when he comes here [on fox news] and when you talk to him on the phone. he's going to be donald trump."      clinton vs. trump: the debate before the debate      
__label__0 bloomberg tv will conduct on-screen fact checks of statements made by both donald trump and hillary clinton during monday night’s debate, politico has confirmed. the channel’s decision to conduct an on-screen fact-check sets bloomberg apart from the other major tv networks, none of whom have committed to doing on-screen fact checks during the debate. most will leave the fact-checking to segments in the post-debate analysis coverage. clinton’s supporters have called for aggressive fact-checking during monday’s debate, saying that members of the media have failed to adequately fact-check and correct falsehoods from her republican rival. nbc’s matt lauer was recently criticized for not correcting several false statements from trump during a presidential forum on the network. spokespeople for the networks told politico that on-screen fact checks would be hard to execute in real-time, which is why they were opting out. that leaves the real-time fact-checking up to nbc’s lester holt, the debate moderator, or the candidates themselves. several other news organizations, including npr, have said they will conduct fact-checks of the debate online and in their post-debate analyses. hadas gold contributed reporting to this post. this story has been updated to reflect that fact checking will be up holt, or the candidates. the original text was due to an editing error.      bloomberg tv to fact check debate on-screen      
__label__0 a chinese company and four of its employees accused of attempting to evade u.s. sanctions against north korea were the target of a set of enforcement actions announced monday morning by the department of justice. chinese trading company dandong hongxiang industrial development co. ltd., its majority owner and three of its managers are charged with conspiring to violate the international emergency economic powers act and weapons of mass destruction proliferators sanctions regulations. they are also charged with attempting to defraud the united states and conspiring to engage in international money laundering. story continued below the charges arise from financial transactions using u.s. dollars between dandong hongxiang industrial development and korea kwangson banking corporation, which is under both u.s. and un sanctions. those transactions, according to the justice department, were conducted both by dandong hongxiang industrial development as well as by “numerous front companies” that it controlled. the justice department also announced a civil complaint, seeking the civil forfeiture of all the money held in the 25 chinese bank accounts of dandong hongxiang industrial development and its front corporations. those accounts are subject to forfeiture, the justice department said, because they received hundreds of millions of dollars that arrived via the united states. because the money was routed through the u.s., it falls under american jurisdiction, the department said. pressure has mounted on president barack obama’s administration to crack down on china, north korea’s largest trading partner and international protector, since the isolated nation’s latest nuclear test earlier this month. republicans and even obama’s own former secretary of state hillary clinton have urged the president to more forcefully pressure china to enforce international sanctions against north korea. rep. ed royce (r-calif.) has specifically called on obama to put to use the north korea sanctions and policy enhancement act, a law signed by the president earlier this year that affords his administration authority to sanction any individual who "imports, exports, or re-exports luxury goods to or into north korea" or "engages in money laundering, counterfeiting of goods or currency, bulk cash smuggling, or narcotics trafficking that supports the government of north korea or its senior officials." republican presidential candidate donald trump has blamed clinton for north korea’s most recent nuclear launch. jason miller, trump’s senior communications adviser, labeled it “one more example of hillary clinton's catastrophic failures as secretary of state," and added that "clinton promised to work to end north korea’s nuclear program as secretary of state, yet the program has only grown in strength and sophistication."      doj: chinese company tried to evade u.s. sanctions against north korea      
__label__0 former new york city mayor rudy giuliani said donald trump is going to be clearer and more precise when he steps up to the debate podium monday night, but beyond that “he’s basically going to be donald trump.” “my advice to him, i think donald trump has done best since donald trump has been just let loose to be donald trump,” the frequent trump surrogate said on “fox and friends” monday morning. “there's a lot of discussion of, you know, how things should be scripted and i think what we've all found that are working with him now is you let him be himself, this man is an extraordinary political thinker himself and a great communicator.” story continued below but like other republicans making the rounds on tv news monday morning, giuliani was quick to set a higher bar for democrat hillary clinton, who the former mayor said has a decided advantage over trump. giuliani said the manhattan billionaire will have to work to counter the former secretary of state’s experience in government and policy expertise on the debate stage. “she has, obviously, policy knowledge i don't have. she's been in government since i was a child. i don't remember a time she hasn't been in government in one way or another,” giuliani said of clinton. “so she's going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has, but i think he's going to comport himself very, very well, and he's going to be -- he's just going to be like you see him on, when he comes here, and when you talk to him on the phone. he's going to be donald trump.” giuliani dismissed concerns about trump’s non-traditional approach to debate preparation, which has eschewed the mock debates that clinton has used to ready herself. giuliani said trump has studied tapes of clinton’s past debate performances as well as his own and likened the preparation to that of a boxer, suggesting that “you get the person ready the way they want to get ready.” one issue that giuliani said trump is not worried about coming up at the debate is the issue of his often inaccuracy-laden campaign rhetoric. multiple media outlets, including politico, have discovered numerous lies and half-truths in fact-checking trump’s remarks, but the former new york mayor said the gop nominee stacks up well against clinton when it comes to truthfulness. “i can't imagine that probably the biggest liar that ever ran for president of the united states is going to bring up lies,” he said. “i mean, this is the woman who’s lied maybe 15 different times about benghazi and told three different stories. so i think if she wants to get to the area of lying, she's lied about things related to national security. that’s a topic we would love.”      giuliani on debate: 'he’s basically going to be donald trump'      
__label__0 on the night of september 26, as the house lights dim in the mack complex at hofstra university and the tv cameras go live, millions of americans will be riveted to the scene. will donald trump seem well prepared? will hillary clinton’s commanding grasp of policy and nuance dazzle viewers? will either candidate rise to the challenge and show voters that they have what it takes to be president? experience suggests it’s hard to make a positive breakthrough—especially with two candidates so well known and so widely disliked. but what is possible is a serious unforced error. story continued below over the 56 years that presidential debates have been televised, one of their great legacies has been the sudden, public gaffe—a mistake live on tv that permanently cements the way voters see the candidate. despite the hopeful aspirations of those voters who welcome a few hours of substantive deliberation on the major issues of the day, the truth is that these are televised performances. what the candidates say often matters less than how they look and what they do with their bodies: every breath they take, every expression they make, and every emotion they convey can play a major role in determining how americans evaluate their performances. and although debates don’t usually transform how most voters think of the candidates, they do confirm voters’ impressions—which matters on election day. for both candidates, this will be a particularly big challenge. donald trump is a larger-than-life presence who likes to intimidate, cajole and verbally bully his opponents by saying things long considered out of bounds—which could lead to an unforced error by hillary clinton. hillary clinton, who sometimes betrays an aversion to letting too much emotion show, has a steely temperament and stinging wit that could easily get under trump’s skin, instigating him into losing control with the cameras rolling. if either of these happens, it will join the long line of memorable, campaign-changing moments that candidates fumbled into. 1. 1960: nixon sweats while debating jfk famously, the very first televised presidential debate offered early evidence that all future debates would be visual affairs. after eight years as vice president, richard nixon was running to inherit the white house from the enormously popular dwight eisenhower. his challenger was john f. kennedy, the charismatic young massachusetts senator whose eloquence and matinee-idol looks captivated much of the nation. on september 26, at the candidates’ first debate, nixon proved to be in strong command of policy. but he looked terrible. famously, prior to the debate, he declined to have any makeup applied to his face. but that decision was made worse by the fact that for much of the previous two weeks, nixon had been away from the campaign trail nursing a knee infection. as a result, he looked peaked. from richard nixon sweating on camera during the first presidential debate to george h.w. bush checking his watch before an audience question—here are some of the most prominent debate gaffes in u.s. history. during their televised rumble, nixon could be seen sweating and, on camera, wiping his brow with a handkerchief. his pale color and five o'clock shadow didn’t help. all of which undercut his performance against kennedy, who was a vision of youthful vigor. 2. 1976: ford and carter freeze in a moment of crisis a more dramatic moment occurred on september 23, 1976, when the sound system malfunctioned in philadelphia’s walnut street theater, forcing a 27-minute delay during the debate, during which president gerald ford and then-governor jimmy carter awkwardly stood still on stage. the broadcast continued as the television crew worked furiously to fix the technical problems. neither candidate wanted to move, fearing that it would somehow look bad to audiences at home, so instead they stood frozen in a comic parody better than anything that “saturday night live” could imagine. moderators robert mcneil and jim lehrer kept talking as the candidates “stood helplessly like two hollywood stand-ins,” wrote jules witcover in the washington post. years later, ford admitted that “i suspect both of us would have liked to sit down and relax while the technicians were fixing the system, but i think both of us were hesitant to make any gesture that might look like we weren’t physically or mentally able to handle a problem like this.” in the end, both men were diminished; they seemed less like leaders than deer caught in headlights. 3. 1980: carter’s grim-faced critiques seem too self-serious in politics, brevity can be a virtue. during his only debate with ronald reagan in the fall of 1980, jimmy carter didn’t get that lesson. in front of a record-breaking 80.6 million viewers, carter was hoping to paint ronald reagan as a creature of the far right—someone like barry goldwater, the gop nominee whom lyndon johnson so successfully branded as an extremist some 16 years earlier. as reagan sought to present himself as a more moderate, relatable republican, carter tried to forcefully punch back in the form of a lengthy and detailed monologue about health care and how reagan had opposed medicare in 1964. while carter looked grim on the attack, reagan grinned like a mildly disappointed father and shot back with just one phrase: “there you go again,” he said with a laugh. the line undercut carter’s entire argument, making reagan look like the bigger man. 4. 1984: mondale lets reagan’s one-liner negate a serious weakness during 1984’s first debate, reagan, then 73, aroused concern when he seemed to have trouble remembering his answers or following the questions. he stumbled over his words and lacked clarity with each statement. his opponent, former vice president walter mondale, was crisp and sharp. in contrast, reagan rambled through his closing statement to the alarm of his advisers. lou cannon wrote that reagan left the stage admitting to campaign adviser stu spencer “that he had flopped.” the wall street journal’s headline the next morning captured the zeitgeist: “new question in race: is oldest president now showing his age?” fortunately for reagan, he came back with a vengeance. in a later debate, when baltimore sun journalist henry trewitt asked reagan if his age would prevent him from fulfilling the rigors of the presidency, reagan had a quip for the ages: “i will not make age an issue in this campaign. i will not exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.” the audience erupted in laughter, including mondale, which completely undercut the seriousness of the underlying charge. 5. 1988: dukakis seems cold in the face of a deeply personal question perhaps the most shocking and controversial opening question in any presidential debate was posed by cnn anchor bernard shaw to massachusetts gov. michael dukakis at the second debate of 1988. dukakis was widely seen as a technocrat, a man whose inner character remained a mystery to many voters. the night before the debate, at 2 a.m., shaw thought of the question that could crack that shell and elicit passion from the candidate. and so he began the debate with it: “governor, if kitty dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?” reporters were shocked, but dukakis seemed unperturbed. in a clinical and dispassionate manner, dukakis simply said “no, i don’t bernard, and i think you know that i’ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life. i don’t see any evidence that it’s a deterrent, and i think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.” it was as though dukakis was talking about a stranger, answering in the same tone that a professor might use to explain a basic point of fact in the classroom. voters were taken aback by how little passion the candidate seemed to have. “it was a question about dukakis’s values and emotions,” his campaign director, susan estrich, later recalled. “when he answered by talking policy, i knew we lost the election.” 6. 1992: bush checks his watch while an audience member asks a question during the 1992 campaign, few moments were more devastating to george h.w. bush than his decision to look at his wrist watch in the middle of a town-hall debate with bill clinton and ross perot. right before an audience member asked the candidates how the national debt personally affected the lives of the candidates and how they could relate to the economic challenges of average americans, bush was seen looking down to figure out how many minutes were left. “only 10 more minutes of this crap,” bush would later say he was thinking at the time. checking the time would’ve been unflattering in a normal debate setup, but coming as it did—during a debate in which ordinary americans posed questions to the presidential candidates—it seemed like bush was bored and uninterested in hearing what real people had to say. for a candidate already under attack for not being concerned about domestic policy, his glance seemed to confirm everything that was said about him. 7. 2000: gore sighs, eye-rolls and miscalculates in a confrontation with bush entering the debates in 2000, vice president al gore and his supporters were pretty confident that they were up against a political lightweight in george w. bush. gore had been in high-profile debates before, and his team was confident that the debates would show american voters that bush, a relative lightweight known to stumble over his words, lacked the clarity and gravitas needed to be president. during the first debate, gore’s overdramatic attempts to emphasize how exasperated he was with bush backfired big time. at several points, microphones caught gore loudly sighing in response to bush’s answers, which played into republican arguments that he was arrogant and condescending. and as bush criticized the democrat’s plans for their “fuzzy math,” gore was seen on the split screen rolling his eyes and shaking his head in frustration. at the third debate, a town-hall-style affair, one of the oddest moments of this or any other debate happened: gore walked right up to bush as he was speaking, as if to physically intimidate him. looking up with an annoyed glance, bush seized the moment, nodding his head with a smirk, and continuing on with his statement, making gore’s action look odd as the audience laughed. donna brazile, who ran gore’s campaign, believed that gore won the debates on policy but “on mannerisms and the takeaway, he ended up losing … many of us remember the split-screen, and al gore was sitting there, rolling his eyes, perhaps, looking at george bush, and basically he started to sigh.” 8. 2004: bush cannot contain his irritation at kerry after the first debate of the general election in 2000, president bush came under criticism when he couldn’t contain how annoyed he was by some of the comments his opponent, senator john kerry, made about bush’s record. though bush had benefited from the visuals of his 2000 debates against vice president al gore, the critics weren’t so kind to bush in 2004, when cameras caught him scowling, clenching his jaw and leaning tensely over his lectern, as he listened to kerry speak. the democratic national committee didn’t wait long to pounce on the president. in their online video, “faces of frustration,” viewers were treated to a repeat of the split screen showing kerry calmly speaking on the left side of the screen with bush’s angry looks on the right side. *** appearances are not the only thing that matters in the debates, of course. what the candidates say will be endlessly scrutinized with the media, while the quality of the one-line zingers, particularly in the viral age of twitter, facebook and youtube, are important in shaping perceptions of the event. and on september 26, 56 years to the day since nixon awkwardly sweated his way through the debate with jfk, we’ll see what happens.      the 8 biggest unforced errors in debate history      
__label__0 i’ve watched every presidential debate ever broadcast, including the little-remembered john f. kennedy-hubert humphrey contest just before the 1960 west virginia primary, and for nearly 40 years i've analyzed how candidates win and lose them. but when i ask myself what kind of strategy i would devise for hillary clinton tonight against donald trump, i’m pretty much baffled. the problem is not just the unpredictable (to put it mildly) nature of her opponent. (will trump be low-key and calm? will he attack her honesty? will he turn on lester holt after the first tough question and walk off the stage?) the problem is that almost all of hillary clinton’s strengths, in this strange election year, can so easily be turned into her weaknesses—especially her vast experience in government. the more she emphasizes her qualifications, the more trump is likely to respond with some version of: “you’ve been at the center of power for 25 years? then you’re one of those who’s created the mess we’re in.” so reciting her work with foreign leaders, for example, and contrasting it with trump's utter lack of grounding in the world, doesn't seem to be promising. story continued below indeed, this debate offers trump the chance to perform what i’ve called “political judo”—turning an opponent’s strength against her. (“yes, mrs. clinton, your experience helped drag us into iraq, and turned syria, libya, the whole middle east into a staging ground for isis. maybe that’s why your husband's cia director, and bobby kennedy’s chief speechwriter, are backing me.”) further, there's a sense—a highly limited sense—in which trump is in something like the position ronald reagan was in back in 1980. among college-educated whites, who have resisted him so far, his task is to use the debates to say, “i'm a reasonable person who knows what's gone wrong and who has the instincts to fix it.” it's a second cousin of the 1980 situation where many voters did not want carter, but needed reassurance about reagan, which they got. (there is a limit to this analogy, because for all of her difficulties, clinton is in a much stronger position than president carter was). by contrast, how does she try to gain strength on the issue of “honest and trustworthy”? if trump can be convinced by his handlers—assuming they exist—to avoid overkill here, all he has to do is to note what the fbi director or the new york times editorial page has said. she can of course cite chapter and verse on trump—bankruptcies, trump university, david farenthold's expose of his charities in the washington post—but those issues are ill-suited, i think, to a face-to-face debate. one of her problems, longstanding, is that the stuff of which campaign collapses are made have been leveled at trump—and he's still standing. does any of this mean that clinton is facing doom monday night? no. it does suggest that her campaign should remember what debates do and don’t do, based on a half-century or so of history. the focus is on “moments”—but they’re not always the key ask any political journalist to recite the history of debates, and it would go something like this: “nixon looked pale and drawn; ford prematurely liberated poland from soviet control; reagan said to carter ‘there you go again,’ then asked americans ‘are you better off?’ four years later, he was incoherent, but then recovered by joking about mondale’s ‘youth and inexperience.’ dukakis was insufficiently emotional at the prospect of his wife’s rape and murder. lloyd bentsen told dan quayle was no jack kennedy. george h.w. bush looked at his watch. al gore stalked george w. bush, who froze him with a nod.” these are the moments that are played over and over again in the run-up to debates. they illustrate the fact that these events are watched intensely for the quip, the gaffe, the thrust, the parry that can sum up 90 minutes. it’s why debate prep spends an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with punchy, memorable lines—“zingers”—to win the attention and admiration of the audience. (it’s also why the late political journalist lars erik-nelson scornfully said of his colleagues, “you’ve all become theater critics.”) but in fact, this view of debates is not the whole story. sometimes, it’s the cumulative effect of the exchanges that can determine who prevails. look back at the first romney-obama debate in 2012. there was no one exchange, no one obama stumble or romney answer, that provided the ”aha!” moment that journalists wait for the way hounds wait for the first call of the fox. it was, rather, obama’s petulant, defensive, sometimes indifferent answers that made even the president’s most ardent supporters believe he had been badly beaten. the presence of trump clearly raises the odds that we may see a “moment” unlike any in debate history; that’s clearly what an army of reporters and tens of millions of viewers will be waiting for. but it may just be that it will be the totality of the hour and a half that will persuade a viewer to say: “he seemed pretty reasonable” or “she knows what she’s talking about and he doesn’t.” this has special relevance for clinton, who, as her longtime friend and one-time aide patti solis-doyle observed, always seems as if she is testing every word before it leaves her mouth. a sustained, relaxed presentation over the course of the debate could be her best weapon against a trump, whose ability to stay within himself when untethered to a teleprompter is questionable. there are three debates, not one—and that can matter a whole lot one key reason why the 1980 reagan-carter debate was so important is that it was the only debate between the two. carter had refused to debate with third-party candidate john anderson, so reagan faced off against anderson on september 21st. when the independent fell below the polling threshold, carter and reagan met for the first and last time on october 28th—barely a week before the election. every other time, there have been three debates; which has meant there is a chance to make up for a less than successful debut. that’s what happened with reagan in 1984, and with george w. bush in 2004; it’s also what happened last time out, when obama emerged from his daze and outperformed romney in their two other meetings. here, i think, is an opening for clinton—especially in the town hall meetings, where she should be able to turn a question—and they are usually very lame "what can you do for my daughter?" questions—into answers that fuse personal concern with a command both of her proposals, and of trump’s astonishing inability to remember what he has proposed from one day to the next. the danger for her is channeling her inner al gore, who challenged bush’s commitment to health care by repeatedly demanding: "what about dingell-norwood?" the opportunity for her is to argue—from experience—that what she has worked for in public life has made the lives of real people better. (further, the town meeting format—with dozens of “real” people as participants—makes the resort to personal insults highly risky). trump is not the only one who can deploy political judo the potential for trump to turn strength into weakness has its roots in the most singularly successful use of political judo. it came in 1992, when independent ross perot was asked if voters should be bothered by his lack of experience. “well,” he said, “they've got a point. i don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. i don't have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. i don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.” judo, however, can cut both ways. there’s a clear opening for clinton if trump were to boast of his leadership skills, and his business success. “well, you might be successful, donald, but we really don’t know because you’re the first presidential candidate ever who won’t show us his taxes. but you know, you should look at the business leaders who support me: mike bloomberg, who’s worth four times what you claim to be worth, and who didn’t start with millions from his father, says you’re a con, a fake. so does marc cuban, who built his success from the ground up. but i do have to admit—you’re way, way ahead of them in, unpaid workers, fleeced contractors and lawsuits.” debates are not decisive one last note. it’s easy to assume that the fate of the world is at stake monday night. a lot of post-election narratives over the years have located debates as the center of the story (“reagan recovered from his first debate-gaffe and went onto win a landslide.” “obama was far more effective in the later debates and was re-elected…”). but is correlation really causation? maybe the economic boom of 1984 has a lot more to do with reagan winning 49 states; maybe the clear if modest economic recovery played the key role in obama’s clear if modest popular vote victory. in their influential 2013 book, the gamble, political scientists john h. sides and lynn vavreck tried to measure the impact of debates, gaffes, and other “game-changers” with real-time public opinion measurements. what they found was that even a dramatic event like romney’s first debate performance had a relative small, and relatively short-lived, impact. compared to the “fundamentals”—economic performance and the ever-growing impact of a polarized electorate—the stuff of which a hundred overwrought post-debate analyses are made may be of only marginal significance. of course, this cycle the “fundamentals” point to a very close race. so you’ll probably want to tune in anyway      is hillary in a no-win situation?

__label__0 with donald trump and hillary clinton set to square off for the first time in monday night’s presidential debate, a new monmouth university poll shows the former secretary of state’s nationwide lead shrinking. trump trails clinton by just four percentage points, 46 percent to 42 percent, among likely voters nationwide in the poll released monday afternoon. that four-point advantage is down from the seven-point edge clinton enjoyed in the previous monmouth poll, released in august. story continued below the four-way poll also included libertarian gary johnson, who polled at 8 percent among likely voters, and the green party’s jill stein, who polled at 2 percent with that group. ahead of monday night’s debate, 75 percent of those polled said they intend to watch, although just 12 percent said it is either “very likely” or “somewhat likely” that the debate will have an impact on which candidate they support. eighty-seven percent of respondents said there is no chance that the debate will affect their support for a particular candidate. on the question of which major-party candidate possesses the correct temperament to be president, those polled favored clinton (58 percent) over trump (35 percent). but respondents were split equally at 48 percent between the two candidates when asked which would better handle the issue of the economy and jobs. respondents were similarly split on the issue of terrorism on u.s. soil, with 48 percent favoring clinton and 45 percent picking trump. the monmouth university poll was conducted from sept. 22-25 via landlines and cell phones, reaching 802 registered voters with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.5 percent. of the 802 respondents, 729 were deemed likely to vote in november’s general election. the margin of error for that group was plus-or-minus 3.6 percent.      monmouth national poll: trump creeps up on clinton      
__label__0 a potential compromise is in the works that could result in more hillary clinton emails recovered by the fbi being made public before the election. last week, a judge ordered the processing under the freedom of information act of a relatively meager 1,050 pages of the fbi-found emails before election day. government lawyers say the fbi turned over about 5,600 work-related clinton emails to the state department beginning in july, although some are duplicates of records already processed and released. during a court hearing in a separate foia lawsuit monday, another judge pushed for a deal that could accelerate the release of those messages, perhaps three-fold, in advance of the nov. 8 vote, in which clinton is hoping to win the white house in a showdown with donald trump. acting on a case brought by vice news journalist jason leopold, u.s. district court judge rudolph contreras ordered the two sides to try to work out a compromise to devote more of state's resources to processing clinton's emails in the coming weeks, rather than other records leopold has requested. contreras ordered both sides to report by wednesday whether a deal can be reached to speed review of the fbi-found clinton emails. ryan james, an attorney for leopold, said that if it was "not possible" for state to allocate more resources to the clinton email disclosure, leopold would be "willing to sacrifice" pages he's due of other clinton-related records in order to get more of the emails released. about 2,200 pages of assorted records are scheduled for processing in the coming month in leopold's case. speaking of the fbi-recovered emails, james said: "we believe those records are more important." initially, justice department attorney robert prince did not sound terribly receptive to the proposal. he that said the email-focused part of leopold's suit against the state department doesn't even encompass the full set of fbi-provided emails, and that leopold previously agreed to limit the clinton email-related portion of his suit to the roughly 54,000 pages of emails clinton turned over on paper in december 2014. the vice news reporter initially submitted a very broad request for almost every clinton-related record at state, but later agreed to narrow it to clinton emails, as well as other records on specific topics. but contreras said it would be odd to penalize leopold for not having foreseen that some emails would be obtained by the fbi. "no one knew these documents existed ... and these documents should have been in the 55,000," the judge said. prince said the fact they weren't in the roughly 54,000 pages of emails clinton turned over did not necessarily reflect any impropriety. and there might be valid reasons these emails weren't in that set, he argued. "just because secretary clinton deleted an email does not mean anything untoward happened here," prince said, noting that federal employees are generally not obliged to save all emails, even those that are-work related. "i'm not suggesting that," replied contreras, who issued the original order that led to state's public release of the 54,000 clinton emails — a process that was completed in february. however, the judge said he believed both sides could work out a compromise that would reallocate some of state's resources to the clinton email project. "it seems to me that if the two of you actually spoke to each other, you could reach some agreement," contreras said. "i'm not going to order that everything be produced by election day. that's just impossible." the judge called a recess in the hearing and ordered the two sides to confer about a possible arrangement. after a half-hour break, prince returned to the courtroom shortly before noon to say that justice department and state department lawyers handling the case were open to a reallocation of resources but needed approval from eric stein, a state department foia official who could not immediately be reached. the potential deal was discussed again monday afternoon during a separate hearing before u.s. district court judge randolph moss, who is overseeing a suit leopold filed against the fbi for certain records related to the clinton email probe. james, who appeared by phone at both hearings, referred at one point to a "tentative agreement" that he said would result in processing an additional 2,200 pages of clinton emails for release by oct. 31. that would be on top of the earlier order — issued in a case brought by the conservative group judicial watch — that state process 350 pages every two weeks, leading to releases on oct. 7, oct. 21 and nov. 4. but justice department lawyer jennie kneedler said james was overstating how close the parties were to a deal. "it's under consideration. i wouldn't describe it as a tentative agreement," kneedler said. she also suggested, as prince did at the earlier hearing, that with various records at various stages of the review process, suspending work on one set of records and moving people to another might not yield as many records as quickly as james was suggesting. "as i'm sure your honor could appreciate, it's not a simple transfer for resources," kneedler told moss. kneedler was unable to tell moss where the fbi got the additional clinton emails, although the justice department lawyer suggested some may have come from an email account longtime clinton aide huma abedin had on clinton's server. the hearing before moss proceeded on the assumption that if state determines the clinton emails are entirely personal, they won't even be processed for release. however, since the records were obtained by the fbi in a criminal investigation, they could be fbi records even if not considered part of state's official files. that could result in partial release of some messages that are not work-related, even if state isn't processing them right now. during the morning hearing, leopold's lawyer mounted a last-minute bid to try to get any additional emails that may be released sent "directly" to the vice news reporter through his attorney, apparently in lieu of them being made public on state's website. the request echoed a debate among transparency advocates about whether records the government discloses should be immediately released to all via the internet, or sent to the requester some time before everyone else gets them. contreras turned down james' request that leopold have first dibs on any additional emails. "i'm happy with them posting it on the website. foia is about informing the public what their government is up to and that means everybody," the judge said. the issue did not arise before moss, with all parties saying they expected any additional clinton emails to be posted on state's website. update (monday: 4 p.m.): this post has been updated with details of the afternoon hearing.      deal nears to speed release of hillary clinton emails      
__label__0 lakeland, fla. — in a bruising pre-debate series of attacks, tim kaine compared donald trump unfavorably to richard nixon, suggested trump pays little in taxes and said hillary clinton will do “very well” as trump struggles with the truth. about eight hours before clinton and trump take the stage in hempstead, n.y., kaine predicted trump will crumble when confronted with any questions that touch specific policy areas. story continued below “you can run but you can’t hide. we’re going to see tonight: can he give any details about anything? can he answer questions like: where’s your tax return?” kaine said, noting that presidents since nixon have released their returns. “if you can’t be as ethical as richard nixon, folks, i mean come on.” at the airport in lakeland, kaine was greeted by michael phillips, a campaign volunteer with a disability who works on technology to allow people with disabilities to better communicate. kaine read aloud a note from phillips at a rally in this central florida town about an hour later, quoting phillips as saying: “i’ve been waiting my entire life for a candidate like you and secretary clinton.” kaine then held up a copy of trump’s recent book, titled “crippled america.” phillips “has a severe disability. he said, ‘that’s not limiting me,’” kaine recounted. “donald trump has a very different vision.” while kaine repeated many familiar attacks on trump as a poor steward of the military for his rhetoric aimed at the likes of sen. john mccain and khizr khan, he also dinged trump for promoting “stop and frisk” policies while tensions between police and black americans persist in places like charlotte and minnesota, saying it would “widen the gap” between police and the community. kaine spent most of his pre-debate comments on trump and questioned his relationship with facts as a partisan argument rages over whether moderator lester holt should fact-check the debate. “donald trump thinks he can get this over on you,” kaine said. “he’s got to answer the questions. and the last thing we get to see [at the debate] about donald trump is whether he can tell the truth.” kaine did predict clinton will do “very well” on monday, a bit more cautious than his “a-plus” prediction at a rally sunday night in the miami area. and he said he’ll be doing his homework in preparation for the debate of his own in eight days in farmville, va. “i’m real interested in this debate. so i’m going to be on the edge of my seat taking notes,” he said. while pence will be in new york to watch trump, kaine will attend a watch party that will include former rep. fannie giffords in orlando.      kaine to trump on debate: 'you can run but you can't hide'      
__label__0 newark, n.j. — gov. chris christie’s former campaign manager — now a top aide to donald trump — was aware of the george washington bridge lane closures before they occurred and knew their intended purpose, according to the admitted mastermind of the political revenge scheme. former christie ally david wildstein said in federal court on monday that he told the governor’s longtime lieutenant, bill stepien, about the idea of using local access lanes as a political “leverage point” years before they occurred. stepien was a deputy chief of staff to the governor at the time. story continued below the two discussed the concept again — that lanes would be closed to create a traffic jam and punish a local mayor — when the plan was about to be set in motion, said wildstein, a secretive political operator and former schoolmate of christie who was appointed by the governor to a position at the authority. stepien, by then the manager of christie’s 2013 reelection campaign, asked about a cover story, wildstein said. “mr. stepien asked about what story we were going to use, and i told mr. stepien we were going to use the cover of a traffic study,” he said. stepien, who was hired this year as a national field director for trump, has not been charged in the incident and had not been previously implicated. christie distanced himself from stepien after details emerged about the scheme. while christie is currently serving as the chairman of trump’s transition team, he has said he did not have a role in stepien’s hiring by the trump campaign. wildstein, who was the director of interstate capital projects for the port authority of new york and new jersey, told jurors in u.s. district court on monday that he first came up with the idea of closing some local lanes to the bridge years before they occurred. the port controls the bridge, considered to be the world’s busiest. wildstein, who has already pleaded guilty, said he visited the bridge in march 2011. it was the first time he got an overhead view of the upper level toll booths and spotted three local lanes leaving fort lee. wildstein said he thought right away about fort lee mayor mark sokolich, a democrat who was being courted for a possible endorsement of the governor’s reelection campaign. “i noticed the traffic moving more quickly through those lanes, and i immediately thought this could be a potential leverage point with mayor sokolich down the road,” wildstein said from the witness stand. he said he told his then-boss, port authority deputy executive director bill baroni, about what he saw and how the lanes could be used. baroni was with him for the visit, he said. “mr. baroni responded that he saw what i saw and he understood — he agreed with me — that this was a potential leverage point,” wildstein said. wildstein later told stepien, then a deputy chief of staff to the governor who ran the office of intergovernmental affairs. after stepien left to run the governor’s campaign later that spring, wildstein told his replacement, bridget anne kelly, about the idea. baroni and kelly are both on trial for closing the lanes in what prosecutors say was an act of political retribution against sokolich for refusing to endorse christie. both were indicted last may on charges of conspiracy, fraud and civil rights violations. kelly emailed wildstein on the morning of august 13 to say it was “time for some traffic problems in fort lee.” wildstein, who responded within a minute to say “got it,” said he immediately knew what she meant. “i understand that to mean that it was time to change the lane configuration at the upper level of the george washington bridge in order to create traffic in the borough of fort lee,” wildstein told jurors under questioning by prosecutor lee cortes. wildstein said he spoke to baroni that morning to say he heard from kelly. he said they were both surprised she wanted to put the plan in place so late in the election season. “mr. baroni was a little surprised it was coming in this late,” wildstein said. “he asked how i was going to do that. i told him i was going to think about it and we’d talk about it later.” wildstein spoke to kelly by phone at 5:48 p.m. that night. “she told me the reason was to send mayor sokolich as message,” he said as kelly, sitting on the opposite side of the court room, looked down. “the indication was that mayor sokolich needed to fully understand that life would be more difficult for him in the second christie term than it had been in the first.” she later discussed with him that they wouldn’t have any communications with fort lee officials after the lane closures started, and that all complaints would be sent to baroni’s office and not responded to. they called the approach “radio silence.” “the purpose was to create as big a traffic jam as possible,” wildstein said. wildstein said it was baroni’s idea to close the lanes in september, not august. he said baroni was concerned traffic might be much lighter with people on vacation and school out, and said wildstein should figure out what day school started in fort lee. the answer, he informed baroni, was sept. 9. “he smiled and said, ‘fantastic,’” wildstein said. kelly also agreed, he said, and he went to work setting the scheme in motion. wildstein continued to testify monday afternoon and could be on the stand for several more days. christie has denied any knowledge or involvement in the lane-closing incident. but wildstein’s attorney says there is evidence to prove the governor knew about the plot when it was occurring, and prosecutors on monday endorsed that theory, saying the governor was told of the traffic gridlock and the mayor’s unanswered complaints on the third day of the lane closings. kevin marino, an attorney for stepien, said his client has committed no wrongdoing and that that a 16-month investigation by prosecutors confirmed that. “despite what mr. wildstein apparently feels compelled to say now, mr. stepien had no role in planning, approving or concealing his ill-advised scheme to close access lanes to the gwb,” marino said in a statement on monday afternoon. “to the contrary, as mr. wildstein has himself acknowledged, mr. stepien expressly advised him that mr. stepien was running a campaign; told him that he was not, and did not wish to be, involved in port authority business; and asked that mr. wildstein not involve him in such business. “mr. wildstein's sad and self-serving accusations from the witness stand may help him avoid prison for his admitted crimes, but they will not help the jury or the public learn the truth.” an internal investigation that was commissioned by the governor had found that stepien misled christie about what he knew about the lane closures, saying that wildstein had approached him beforehand. the report has been widely discredited as a whitewash. marino wrote a letter in 2014 saying that it wasn’t the case that he kept christie in the dark about the contact, and that he had disclosed to the governor that wildstein spoke to him. “there is no dispute that at that december 12, 2013, meeting, mr. stepien informed the governor that the proposed ‘lane realignment’ was one of mr. wildstein’s ‘50 crazy ideas,’” marino wrote in the letter. later in the day, wildstein said that he told william “pat” schuber, a sitting member of the port authority's board, about the lane closures before they occurred. wildstein said that he met with schuber — a former republican assemblyman and bergen county executive — for breakfast on august 30, 2013, at the river edge diner. that was just 10 days before the closures began, and wildstein said he’d already done much of the planning. an attorney for schuber, salvatore alfano of bloomfield, said wildstein fabricated his testimony. note: this article has been updated with the statement from stepien's lawyer and with additional details of wildstein's testimony. correction: this story initially stated that wildstein visited the bridge and identified the lanes in 2013. it was 2011.      new jersey bridgegate plotter says christie campaign manager, now a trump aide, approved      
__label__0 hillary clinton and donald trump are deadlocked in three swing states, according to a new set of polls, underscoring the stakes of monday night’s debate for the final stretch of the election. the former secretary of state holds narrow leads in florida, iowa and north carolina, all within the polls’ margins of error, with clinton only well ahead of trump in virginia in this set of the surveys. a florida chamber of commerce poll puts the democratic nominee just two points ahead of her gop rival, 43 percent to 41 percent, with the state’s likely voters. gary johnson, the libertarian candidate, polled at 8 percent, while the green party’s jill stein did not register any support. in a head-to-head race that excludes johnson, clinton's lead grows by a point, 45 percent to 42 percent. in north carolina, clinton’s advantage over trump among likely voters is just a single point, according to a high point university poll. the former secretary of state leads trump 43 percent to 42 percent, with johnson polling at 10 percent. stein is not on the ballot in north carolina. the two-way presidential race is closest in iowa, where a loras college poll puts clinton’s lead over trump at just three-tenths of a point, 42.3 percent to 42 percent. the manhattan billionaire edges slightly ahead in a four-way race, leading 38.3 percent to 37.7 percent over the democratic nominee. johnson earned the support of 9 percent of respondents while stein polled at 1.2 percent. the best news for clinton came from virginia, where a christopher newport university poll put her ahead by 10 points, 48 percent to 38 percent, among that state’s likely voters. the state was also the strongest for johnson, who polled at 15 percent in a five-way race that also included stein (3 percent) and independent candidate evan mcmullin (3 percent). clinton’s advantage over trump in that five-way race dropped to six points, 39 percent to 33 percent. in politico’s battleground states polling average, which includes 11 swing states, clinton still edges trump 43.7 percent to trump’s 40.9 percent. the florida chamber of commerce poll was conducted from sept. 15-20, reaching 617 likely voters in that state with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4 percent. the high point university poll reached 404 north carolinian likely voters from sept. 17-22, with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4.9 points. loras college’s poll of iowan likely voters was conducted from sept. 20-22, reaching 491 respondents with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4.4 percent. the christopher newport university poll was in the field from sept. 15-23, reaching 1,003 likely voters in virginia. its margin of error is plus-or-minus 3.9 percent.      clinton in dead heat with trump in new swing state polls      
__label__0 if recent history is any guide for the first debate between donald trump and hillary clinton, the polls will become more volatile in the ensuing days, bouncing around more than during the more stable periods of the campaign. but then the race will return to its normal equilibrium, reflecting largely locked-in perceptions of the two candidates. that's no certainty, though. in a race as close as this one, a debate can alter the trajectory of a race — as in 1976, when gerald ford was surging in the polls in the fall but may have seen his momentum stunted by a poor performance in a foreign-policy debate with jimmy carter in which the republican claimed there was “no soviet domination” of eastern europe. story continued below the more frequent outcome resembles what happened in 2012, when mitt romney saw his poll numbers swell after a strong performance in the first debate, but fade just as quickly. same for the 2000 presidential nail-biter, when polls after the first debate showed a brief bump for george w. bush before returning to an al gore lead before the second debate. and in 1984, walter mondale cut into ronald reagan’s lead after their first debate, but reagan parried mondale’s attacks in their second meeting and resumed on course for his landslide victory. the most interesting potential analog to this year's hofstra university debate might be 1980. carter and reagan debated only once that year, with reagan getting a slight bounce after their debate. but the most consequential part of that campaign might be the candidate who wasn’t on stage: john anderson, the gop congressman from illinois who ran for president as an independent. carter declined to debate anderson, so the first-term incumbent skipped the first debate. anderson had been polling at about 15 percent in mid-september, according to gallup — but he received only about 7 percent of the vote on election day. support for third-party candidates this year rivals anderson’s backing: libertarian gary johnson and green party nominee jill stein are combining for about 10 percent of the vote in likely-voter surveys. (ross perot in 1992 also had significant support, but he participated in debates with george h.w. bush and bill clinton.) there are some parallels in the 2016 campaign — and reasons to believe the three debates, starting with monday night's, could be decisive. 1. the race is closer than recent elections. the national polls out on monday set the stakes: clinton and trump are even in a bloomberg politics survey, and clinton leads by 1 point in a quinnipiac university poll and 4 points in a monmouth university poll. in the poll averages, clinton leads trump by a slim margin: 2.2 points in the realclearpolitics average, as of monday afternoon. that’s closer than most recent elections. on the eve of the first debate in 2012, president barack obama led romney by 3.1 points in the realclearpolitics average, and the democrat had a 4.2-point lead over john mccain in 2008. george w. bush led john kerry by 6 points on the eve of their first debate in 2004. and it’s close in the battleground states, too. in politico’s battleground states polling average, clinton has a lead of 5 points or greater in six states: colorado, michigan, new hampshire, pennsylvania, virginia and wisconsin. but the most recent polls in colorado, pennsylvania and wisconsin show a much closer race. trump, meanwhile, has pulled narrowly ahead in iowa and ohio. the two candidates are within a single point in three states: florida, nevada and north carolina. 2. more voters are up for grabs this year. neither clinton nor trump is popular: in both the bloomberg and monmouth polls, majorities of likely voters have negative impressions of each candidate. but between the candidates’ poor image ratings and the large segment of voters backing either johnson or stein, there’s more volatility in this race than other recent elections. as of monday afternoon, the realclearpolitics average showed clinton at 46.2 percent and trump at 44 percent in a two-way matchup. (in a four-way matchup, clinton is at 42.9 percent and trump at 41.2 percent.) that leaves more voters up for grabs than in recent elections. in 2012, obama led romney in the realclearpolitics average, 49.1 percent to 46 percent, combining for more than 95 percent. in 2008, obama’s lead over mccain stood at 47.9 percent to 43.7 percent, combining for nearly 92 percent. in 2004, bush led kerry, 49.5 percent to 43.5 percent, combining for 93 percent. (in 1980, a pre-debate gallup poll showed carter narrowly ahead of reagan by 3 points, 45 percent to 42 percent, with anderson at 9 percent.) both candidates still face enormous headwinds in changing voters’ perceptions of them beginning on monday night, but there are voters out there who haven’t yet committed to either candidate. 3. a massive audience is expected to watch. television ratings for monday night’s debate could challenge the all-time record: the nearly 81 million people who watched the carter-reagan debate in 1980, according to nielsen. the debate is going up against “monday night football” on espn — a matchup of two of the weaker teams in pro football: the atlanta falcons and new orleans saints. but the debate will be on all the broadcast networks and each of the cable-news outlets. (the game will air instead of the debate on the nbc affiliate in new orleans.) even espn thinks the game won’t be a significant drag on debate ratings, with an executive telling sports illustrated “it’s going to be a rough night” for football viewership. if the debate doesn’t outrate 1980, it should still draw more eyeballs than the first debates in more recent elections: the first debate in 2012 drew 67 million television viewers, compared to 52 million in 2008, 63 million in 2004 and 47 million in 2000. usually, according to nielsen data, the first debate in a given year outrates the subsequent debates — that’s been true in three of the past four elections. that makes monday night the best chance for both clinton and trump to claim an advantage in a close race. “maybe two-thirds of the people who vote in this election are going to watch the entire debate,” former obama campaign manager david plouffe said monday morning on msnbc. “this is an incredible moment for both candidates to speak directly” to voters.      will trump get a bump?      
__label__0 the senate will vote on wednesday to override president barack obama’s veto of legislation that would allow the families of the victims of the sept. 11, 2001 attacks to sue the government of saudi arabia, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) said monday. the house is likely to vote on the override thursday or friday, a republican leadership aide said. story continued below congress is expected to easily clinch the two-thirds support needed to override obama’s veto, which would be the first veto override of his presidency. the legislation, known formally as the justice against sponsors of terrorism act, sailed through congress with no recorded objections earlier this year. but with a veto override apparently imminent, some lawmakers, particularly ones who specialize in national security policy, have become increasingly vocal about their concerns with the bill. both the chairman and the top democrat on the house armed services committee — republican mac thornberry of texas and democrat adam smith of washington — are circulating letters urging lawmakers to oppose jasta. they warn that the legislation could open up u.s. officials abroad to retaliation.      senate to vote wednesday on override of saudi 9/11 bill

you know who could beat hillary clinton? marco rubio, and i disagree with him on the gang of eight, and there’s about 80 percent that i do agree with him on, and he’s kind of a politician, but he’s a different kind of politician. he’s a young politician. he’s a hispanic, he can win. let’s go for it.’" instead, beck sought “a truly honorable man” in cruz — “and that will always let you down,” he said. but while lamenting the fact that cruz chose to be a politician friday, beck said that he believes the texas firebrand is still a good man. “i’m not gonna condemn him. he is still, i believe, a good man,” beck said. “he is just a politician first. i’ve never put him into the category of a politician, and that’s my fault. he is a politician.” for his part, cruz insisted to beck monday that he was trying to show the trump campaign how to earn his vote with his floor speech at the republican national convention in which he encouraged republicans to vote their conscience in november. after beck noted that cruz failed to answer a question this past weekend about whether the real estate mogul was fit to be president, the senator explained that the presidential election is a binary choice, a conclusion he reached after whittling down five possible options (vote for trump, for clinton, a third-party candidate, write in a candidate or abstain). “so a man who has principles who says there are lines i will not cross — it’s still a binary choice, so a man who you cannot come on and say, ‘yes, glenn, he is fit to be president of the united states,’ i still am encouraged by you to abandon my principles and vote because it’s a binary choice?” beck asked. “you are encouraged by me to do what you believe is right and honorable in principle,” cruz shot back, warning of the damage he said clinton would do to america. beck, however, wasn’t satisfied. “this is information that you had in cleveland — and hang on just a second before you respond — you had all of this information. you had this information the day you dropped out of the race and said that donald trump is a sociopathic liar,” beck said. “so you had all this information. have you spent an enormous amount of time with donald trump? do you have new information that has made you say: ‘oh, my gosh, he’s now not a sociopathic liar. he is not the guy i very eloquently spelled out for over a year, and now suddenly there’s a reason to believe him.’” despite his “significant disagreements” with trump, cruz said, it’s a binary choice. “i’m asking for new information. i’m asking you for new information,” beck said. “you knew all the things that you’re saying today. the time to do that would have been the day you pulled out or the day that you gave the speech so eloquently. why now? what’s new?” cruz pointed to the trump campaign’s release of possible conservative supreme court nominees, a list that includes cruz ally utah sen. mike lee. he suggested he had a hand in the list, noting that the supreme court was an issue he raised with vice presidential nominee mike pence when he asked the texas senator what it would take to get him on board. “we discussed the supreme court as being one of the great checks protecting the constitution and the rule of law, and the trump campaign committing to nominate from that list was an important change that gave me significant reassurance that helped me get to the point of saying yes,” cruz said. after stu burguiere pressed cruz on why he would believe anything trump says, he rattled off a series of principles at stake. “now, with respect to the justices donald trump would nominate, i know that he is publicly committing to nominate from a list that is very strong, and if he were to nominate from that list, it would be a major step towards protecting our rights,” cruz said. “i hope that he would follow through on that commitment. one never knows if one will, but the fact that he is public promising ‘i will nominate from these 21,’ i think creates a dynamic where, compared to hillary, who is promising to put left-wing ideologues, that’s a clear choice.” cruz also disagreed with the wide interpretation that his rnc remarks were a swipe against trump, adding that he’s always been “never hillary” but not ever “never trump.” he also said he gleaned parts of his speech from what ronald reagan said about gerald ford and what ted kennedy said about jimmy carter. “my speech drew deliberately from both of those speeches,” cruz said. “both of those speeches at the time were treated effectively as endorsement speeches. one of the unfortunate things about the reaction is cleveland is that for many who were watching, it was perceived that i was essentially embracing never trump. i have never been a never trumper.” after cruz’s appearance, beck said cruz would have been better of just telling the truth about why he backed trump. “he could have come on and said, ‘look, guys, here’s the thing, my supporters are yelling at me,’ and i know that, because so are mine,” he said. “’my donors, who are all in with the gop, they’re all saying i’ll never fund — i won’t fund you for the senate. i won’t fund you for the run in 2020. and i have to make a decision. so the question is do i completely shut myself out of this game or do i play the game as much as i possibly can?’”      glenn beck shares buyer's remorse on cruz endorsement      
__label__0 white house press secretary josh earnest said president barack obama will spend monday night like he does most other monday nights in the fall, watching tv while he works in the white house residence. except instead of monday night football, earnest said obama’s tv will be tuned to monday night’s presidential debate. story continued below “i anticipate that this fall monday evening will be similar to fall monday evenings in the white house residence, which is that the president will be working tonight with the television on in the background,” earnest said at the news briefing. “i think the one difference will be instead of monday night football, there’ll be a little more politics being discussed in the context of the debate.” asked what advice the president might have for his former secretary of state, earnest reiterated what obama told abc’s robin roberts in an interview last week, that clinton should be herself and explain to voters her motivations for running for office. asked what advice the president might have for trump, earnest replied that “even if we did, i’m confident it would go unheard.” the press secretary said he was not aware of any planned phone calls between obama and clinton today and added that the two had most recently spoken two weeks ago. earnest said the president has high expectations for clinton based on his “experience of going head-to-head with secretary clinton in the context of a debate and she performed quite well in those settings,” adding that “i think the president expects her to do the same tonight.” “this is an important moment in the campaign, and anybody that’s worked on a campaign at any level understands how significant candidate debates are. and it’s an opportunity for the candidates to square off and to speak for themselves in answering questions and describing their experience and their vision and their priorities,” earnest said. “look, there hasn’t been a lot of space for that in the context of this presidential election, so this is a rather unique opportunity for that kind of discussion to take place. and i think people are quite interested to tune in and see how the individual candidates handle themselves in this setting.” regarding polls showing a tightening presidential race, earnest said the white house has not been monitoring polls but suggested that a tight campaign might generate increased interest from american voters. “if reports about tightening polls convince more people to tune into the debate and educate themselves about the positions taken by the individual candidates and impress upon voters the need to be engaged in the political debate in this country, that’s a good thing.”      obama plans to tune into the debate from the white house

of lagadikia | sakis mitrolidis/afp via getty images lesbos, greece — ten-year-old foual from gaza is an aspiring polyglot. at the entrance to kara tepe, the second-largest refugee camp on lesbos, he greets visitors in english, german, and spanish. he knows some turkish, too, and can almost count to twenty in greek. “i’m learning by myself,” foual says proudly. he has no alternative: there are no formal schools in greek camps. as a refugee in lebanon, he attended three years of primary education, but since he arrived in europe six months ago, he’s been out of school. ask parents why they decided to make the journey across the mediterranean, and most will tell you that they took the risk to ensure a better future for their children. but since the balkan states closed their borders in march, the thousands of refugee children marooned in greece have had little or no access to education, despite having reached europe. they join an estimated 3.5 million refugee children across the globe who are missing out on school. starting this month, the greek government is hoping to change that by enrolling refugees in public schools — but for the past seven months, children in camps have only had access to casual volunteer-run classes. the [greek] ministry of education hopes to enrol thousands of refugee children in greek schools, starting by the end of the month. of the 27,000 children stranded in greece, at least 18,000 are thought to be of school age. “it’s not really a school, just a class,” foual says of the education project in kara tepe. his elder sister, 11-year-old melek, interrupts: “it’s not like in lebanon where we had a system and a curriculum. here, it’s a little greek, a little english, just one class for an hour a day.” rights organisations have long warned of a “lost generation” of refugee children missing out on education. the crisis is particularly dire among syrians: 1.5 million children who have fled to neighbouring turkey, jordan or lebanon are not in school, creating a surge in child labour and early marriage. in greece, the average refugee child has been out of school for a year and a half, according to the ngo save the children. initially, education was not a priority for the greek government, which has struggled to provide even basic services to the 60,000 asylum-seekers now marooned in the country. yet with registration and relocation programmes moving at a snail’s pace, there is a growing realisation that the tens of thousands of asylum-seekers will remain in greece for some time. “things change every week, but we assume they are going to be stuck for a while,” says naoko imoto, an education specialist for unicef in greece. “we’re thinking about years, really.” accordingly, the greek government has begun planning for the long term. the ministry of education hopes to enrol thousands of refugee children in greek schools, starting by the end of the month. of the 27,000 children stranded in greece, at least 18,000 are thought to be of school age. for the current school year, refugee children will be taught separately from greek students. these so-called “reception classes” will take place in the afternoon, four hours a day, focusing on greek and english, mathematics and it. the aim, the government says, is to prepare the refugee students to join normal classes in the coming year — either in greece or elsewhere in europe. for younger children, kindergartens are planned to be opened in camps. even though asylum seekers will initially be taught separately from greek children, the move has been met with opposition. on tuesday, a parents’ association in the northern greek town of filippiada complained about the plan, voicing fears about diseases and arguing that their children would be unable to “coexist with migrant children”. refugee children, the parents’ association states, had “different perceptions on the role of family, the place of women and religion to greek children whose parents have made sacrifices to offer their children the best education.” the greek education ministry earlier this month dismissed a complaint from a parents’ association in oresteiada, another town on the northern mainland, which had threatened a sit-in protest if children from camps were admitted into their school. also on politico timor sharan also on politico lili bayer also on politico florian eder and janosch delcker nikos filis, the education minister, says the integration of refugee children would be “gradual,” and that pupils would be vaccinated before attending public schools. “hence, there is no serious justification” for the parents’ protests but “only prejudice,” filis says. until the official programme comes into effect, however, volunteers and refugee teachers continue to plug the gap. makeshift schools have popped up in most camps, but attendance is voluntary, and teaching refugee children come with challenges. “some of them never went to school,” says corien tiemersma, a dutch volunteer who has taught english in the malakasa camp north of athens, home to nearly a thousand mostly afghan refugees. “and at the beginning, they weren’t used to sitting down.” unicef’s imoto hopes that formal education will introduce stability to the lives of children living in limbo in greece. “it’s urgent that we get these children into school, so that they have an education but also a sense of normalcy and hope,” she says. imoto said they were also planning to train refugees who were teachers in their home countries to give classes in the children’s mother tongues, something greek schools cannot provide. “they are the biggest resource we have,” she says. education for her children was her prime motivation for making the perilous crossing to greece, [amal ismail] explains, pouring the tea into glass jars that serve as cups. in nea kavala, a military-run tent camp north of thessaloniki, refugees and volunteers work side-by-side in the camp’s community centre. mahmoud mohammad, a former tailor from syria’s kurdish-majority afrin area, is using his english skills to teach children in the camp. the school, he says, “is the most important achievement in the camp.” he works alongside five others, including ragda, a syrian teacher from idlib, who has been giving arabic classes for four months. “i began volunteering because there are a lot of kids here and they should go to school,” ragda says. there have been some difficulties, she admits. “there are some yazidi and kurdish children who don’t speak arabic, so i had to teach them arabic first.” but with limited resources and few trained teachers, the nea kavala school is unable to provide formal education. classes run for only two hours a day. “i want to study. i dropped out at eighth grade in syria,” says rewan, a 15-year-old refugee from afrin who has been in nea kavala for six months. “but there’s no real school. it’s an hour a day plus language classes, and the first level includes everyone from first to eighth grade.” a few tent rows away, amal ismail, a kurdish woman from aleppo, boils water for tea in a rusty tin. her children, three girls and a boy, have missed out on years of school; her 11-year-old son worked with her husband in a clothing factory in turkey’s izmir for two years to support the family. education for her children was her prime motivation for making the perilous crossing to greece, she explains, pouring the tea into glass jars that serve as cups. they had been in nea kavala for seven months. “we lived in fear in syria,” she says. “we thought we’d be free of fear in europe. but here, we’re afraid our children will never go to school and learn.”  © 2016 politico sprl log in to access content and manage your profile. if you

__label__0 president barack obama violated the longstanding, albeit unofficial, rule against presidential headgear on monday when he accepted a hat and blanket at the white house tribal nations conference. the president was given the hat and blanket by native american leaders as he took the stage ahead of remarks at the conference. he wore the blanket around his shoulders as a song was played in his honor, but took the hat off after just a few moments. story continued below “what an amazing honor and what a kind gesture, for the honor song and the blanket and the hat,” obama said once he took the podium. “i have to say that i am very glad that you also have a blanket for michelle so she doesn’t steal mine. she would, too. i’m just saying.” “that was very moving, and is a reminder of the great friendships that we’ve developed over the last eight years,” he added. the unofficial rule against presidents wearing unusual hats is widely credited to democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis, whose decision to wear a tank-commander’s helmet during a ride in an m1a1 abrams main battle tank has been widely ridiculed to this day. obama himself acknowledged the rule during a 2013 visit from the naval academy’s football team, which presented him with one of its helmets. “here’s the general rule: you don’t put stuff on your head if you’re president,” obama said, explaining his refusal to put on the helmet that had been fitted for him. “that’s politics 101. you never look good wearing something on your head.”      obama wears hat, breaking ‘politics 101’ rule on headgear      
__label__0 donald trump is a racist, senate minority leader harry reid said on the senate floor monday afternoon, and the media has been negligent by refusing to label him as such. “virtually every time donald trump says or does something discriminatory -- and that's often -- the media relies upon a catalog of buzzwords to describe his actions,” reid (d-nev.) said monday. “the press uses words like hateful, intolerant, bigot, extremist, prejudice, to name but a few. yet there's always one word that many of the press conspicuously avoid: racist. they never label trump as a racist. but he is a racist. donald trump is a racist.” story continued below in his senate floor remarks, reid said “racist is a term i don’t throw around lightly,” and detailed a handful of the allegations of discriminatory behavior leveled against the gop nominee. the nevada senator recalled the housing discrimination lawsuit filed against trump in the 1970s, when his real estate company was sued for steering minority applicants away from buildings with mostly white tenants and marking their applications with a “c” or the number nine. he also quoted a former employee of one of trump’s atlantic city, new jersey, casinos who recalled an edict from the manhattan billionaire that black employees be pulled off the casino floor whenever he visited. reid said trump’s racism has “reached new heights” during his white house bid. he ticked off trump’s support for the so-called “birther” movement, his proposal to temporarily ban muslims from entering the united states and his comment — uttered when he first announced his candidacy — that mexican immigrants "are bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists, and some, i assume, are good people.” he also highlighted trump’s attacks against u.s. district court judge gonzalo curiel, who the manhattan billionaire has accused of bias in presiding over a fraud case against him because of the judge’s mexican heritage. house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) called trump’s attacks “the textbook definition of a racist comment.” “here we are seven weeks from election day, and the speaker of the house and senate republican leader are both endorsing this racist man. we probably should not support a man for president who by their speaker's own admission is a textbook definition of a racist,” reid said. “think of the example he's setting for our nation's youth. republicans are normalizing this racist behavior. this will be their legacy, one of them. they got plenty to add to that.” “it's time for republicans to stop closing their eyes to donald trump's racism, and it's time for reporters and journalists to be honest with the american people,” reid added. “they owe america the truth. through his words and deeds, donald trump is a racist.”      harry reid: 'donald trump is a racist'

"questionable assertions that an opponent is not eligible to run, or that another cannot be elected, or that still another lacks enthusiasm or energy, are a poor substitute for addressing the real issues that should be the basis for a positive campaign: restoring economic growth, strengthening national security, eliminating cronyism and corruption, and improving the lives of all americans," he added. but with trump's nomination cemented and the polls tightening, meese and other trump critics like ted cruz are beginning to come around. two sources said meese is heading a trump transition group focused on the executive office of the president, which includes the office of management and budget. meese declined to comment, and the trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. meese was an aide to reagan during his time as governor of california. he led reagan's presidential transition team in 1980 and later served as reagan's attorney general before resigning in july 1988 following a special prosecutor's inquiry involving his ties to an army contractor and an iraqi pipeline project. he is a fellow at the heritage foundation. trump's transition team, which is led by new jersey gov. chris christie, is rapidly expanding, with one source telling politico that nearly 100 people are now involved in the effort. and even as some republicans refuse to take part, christie and his staff have managed to recruit people with both establishment and conservative credentials, including former heritage foundation president ed feulner and eric ueland, the senate budget committee's republican staff director. in addition to meese and feulner, sources told politico that paul winfree, another heritage foundation official, is also working on the trump transition. winfree declined to comment.      sources: former trump critic ed meese joins transition team      
__label__0 the massive audience expected for the first presidential debate between hillary clinton and donald trump is “a gift,” the former secretary of state’s communications director jennifer palmieri said monday evening, because it affords the democratic nominee a chance to “break through with her positive message.” palmieri admitted that trump’s controversial candidacy is likely playing the biggest role in drawing so many eyeballs to the debate, scheduled for monday night at new york’s hofstra university. that bombast could prompt millions of americans to watch the two candidates square off and could end up benefiting clinton, she said. story continued below “the gift of the debate for us and the gift of running against somebody as controversial as trump is the interest in the debate, so there’s 100 million people watching,” palmieri told chuck todd on msnbc’s “mtp daily.” “it's 100 million people we’re going to be in front of. it's more than the convention. it is a gift that no other presidential candidate has gotten.” “it's bigger than most debates because of that audience. and so we see that as a gift. and so i think the pregame, the post-game, the press coverage, it has an impact but more so than any other debate, what is really going to matter is the actual audience that’s watching,” she continued. “and for us in this cycle, because we are running against somebody like trump, and it's hard to break through. we fully admit this, our reality is it's hard for hillary to break through with her positive message.”      clinton camp: huge debate audience is 'a gift' for us

__label__0 catherine cortez masto would be the first latina senator if she wins the race to replace harry reid in nevada. but some republicans are nonetheless accusing her this week of “hispandering” to voters. on thursday, two former political aides to rep. joe heck (r-nev.) questioned cortez masto’s emphasis on her ethnicity, responding to a washington post story highlighting the former attorney general as one of the prominent hispanic candidates running for federal office this fall. story continued below thomas mcallister, a former political director to heck who is hispanic, called her appeals to be elected as the first latina in the senate “bs,” deeming her “as mexican as i am” on social media, then questioning why she doesn’t speak spanish fluently. mark ciavola, who managed heck’s previous runs for congress, called her campaign “hispandering at its finest.” in a phone interview on friday, cortez masto called the comments “an attack on mexican-americans.” “it's a criticism for me and other mexican-americans. it is an attack on all of us who come here and have worked hard in nevada to make it home,” she said after holding a press conference in nevada to decry the remarks by heck’s former political aides. “it’s an indication of their theme, which is to attack me personally.” cortez masto’s grandfather immigrated to the united states from chihuahua, mexico. cortez masto's senate race is one of the most closely watched in the nation. one other latina senate candidate, rep. loretta sanchez (d-calif.), is on the ballot this fall, but she's a heavy underdog. mcallister and ciavola had been working on heck’s campaign until this spring. heck’s campaign said they do not speak for the candidate and moved to distance the congressman from their comments. “we have many questions for [catherine cortez masto], but none of them relate to her heritage. no one affiliated with this campaign has questioned that,” said a spokesman for heck, later adding: “her attempt to link us to someone unaffiliated with this campaign is ridiculous given her silence on her chief surrogate and fundraiser harry reid’s many offensive comments, such as calling iraq veteran joe heck a ‘detriment to our country.’” but cortez masto said that’s not enough for her and she’s “going to keep talking about” her heritage and those questioning it as part of her efforts to succeed reid. “that's the first i’m hearing of it. and quite frankly he should be very vocal in denouncing it. and that's the problem: he hasn't denounced anything,” she said. on thursday evening buzzfeed reported that heck’s son, joey, had posted a string of offensive messages on social media. he and heck later apologized for the second such outburst in four years. cortez masto called joey’s remarks “horrific” in the interview. cortez masto has consistently trailed heck in recent polls and the republican has been credited for running a strong campaign in a difficult year overall for the gop. democrats believe that surveys have under-represented latino support for cortez masto. democrats have been frustrated by heck and conservative groups’ relentless attacks on cortez masto's record as attorney general recent republican ads blame her for an increase in crime and going easy on drunk drivers. heck has set up a website calling her “corrupt.” the race is one of a handful central to democrats' hopes of winning control of the senate.      cortez masto seizes on 'hispandering' attack      
__label__0 two months after he was booed off the stage at the republican national convention for snubbing his party’s presidential nominee, sen. ted cruz endorsed donald trump on friday. that declaration to vote for him, though, comes after the texas senator openly disparaged his primary opponent repeatedly — in part responding to trump’s attacks on his wife and father. story continued below 1. early on, cruz speculated that trump’s tax returns could show a mob connection in february, cruz offered his take on why trump hadn’t released his tax returns in an interview on nbc’s “meet the press,” suggesting that they might show “donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia.” “the fact that donald seems terrified to release his taxes suggests that there’s a bombshell there,” cruz said. “it’s natural to wonder, ‘well, what is it that he's hiding in his taxes?’” 2. in march, cruz called him a “sniveling coward” speaking to a group of reporters in dane, wisconsin, after trump made a comment promising to “spill the beans” on the senator’s wife, cruz pointed his finger and said, “donald, you’re a sniveling coward. leave heidi the hell alone.” “it’s not easy to tick me off. i don’t get angry often, but you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that’ll do it every time,” cruz said. 3. he also called trump a “big, loud new york bully” “let me be absolutely clear: our spouses and our children are off bounds,” cruz said. “it is not acceptable for a big, loud new york bully to attack my wife.” 4. also, “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women” trump’s attacks, cruz suggested, were actions of “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women.” 5. cruz called one of trump’s theories “nuts” and “just kooky” in may, after trump cited a national enquirer report that alleged cruz’s father may have had some involvement in the assassination of president john f. kennedy, cruz addressed reporters in evansville, indiana: “this morning, donald trump went on national television and attacked my father. donald trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating jfk. now, let’s be clear, this is nuts. this is not a reasonable position. this is just kooky.” 6. he also called him a “pathological liar” who “lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth” also in indiana, on the same day the state's voters would deliver a decisive victory to trump, cruz added: “i’m gonna tell you what i really think of donald trump: this man is a pathological liar. he doesn’t know the difference between truth and lies. he lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth, and in a pattern that i think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.” 7. and cruz was specific with the term “pathological”: trump is “utterly amoral,” he said “i say pathological because i actually think donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory and he’d pass the lie detector test each time. whatever lie he’s telling, at that minute he believes it, but the man is utterly amoral,” cruz said. 8. and, while he was at it, cruz accused him of narcissism and being a “serial philanderer” continuing to unload in indiana, cruz offered: “he combines [dishonesty] with being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level i don’t think this country’s ever seen. donald trump is such a narcissist that barack obama looks at him and says, ‘dude, what’s your problem?’’’ and: “donald trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it. this is not a secret. he’s proud of being a serial philanderer.” 9. in july, cruz still hadn’t forgiven trump for the attacks on his family “i am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,” cruz said, answering questions at a texas delegation breakfast at the republican national convention in cleveland and facing backlash for not yet endorsing trump. referring to his pledge to support his party’s nominee, cruz said that statement “was not a blanket commitment that if you slander and attack heidi i'm going to nonetheless go like a servile puppy dog" and support him.      9 times ted cruz insulted donald trump before endorsing him      
__label__0 bruce springsteen called republican presidential nominee donald trump a “moron” in an excerpt from an interview with rolling stone magazine published friday. “the republic is under siege by a moron, basically. the whole thing is tragic. without overstating it, it's a tragedy for our democracy,” the rocker said, when asked what he makes of the “trump phenomenon”. story continued below springsteen criticized trump’s rhetoric, saying, “the ideas he's moving to the mainstream are all very dangerous ideas — white nationalism and the alt-right movement. the outrageous things that he's done — not immediately disavowing david duke?” springsteen said that the things trump has said and done would have ended any previous candidate’s campaign “immediately." “i believe that there's a price being paid for not addressing the real cost of the deindustrialization and globalization [in the u.s.],” he said, adding, “trump's thing is simple answers to very complex problems. fallacious answers to very complex problems. and that can be very appealing.” springsteen also offered strong words of support for democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton, saying, “i like hillary. i think she would be a very, very good president.” when asked whether he’s given up on trying to impact the race, he said, “i don't know. i think you have a limited amount of impact as an entertainer, performer or musician.” however, he said he would consider getting involved with the election, adding, “i did it at the time because i felt the country was in crisis, which it certainly is right now.”      bruce springsteen on trump: 'the republic is under siege by a moron, basically'      
__label__0 donald trump’s son will headline a fundraiser for a trump super pac next week, a move that comes amid ongoing confusion in the republican donor world about which pro-trump group to support. donald trump jr. is slated to attend a new york city fundraiser on thursday for rebuilding america now, a super pac that’s being chaired by florida gov. rick scott. alex castellanos, a veteran republican strategist, is also helping to steer the group. story continued below an invitation to the fundraiser lists a handful of hosts including former world wrestling entertainment ceo linda mcmahon, wall street investor anthony scaramucci, and investor howard lorber. it’s not the first time the younger trump has boosted rebuilding america now. on monday, he appeared at another event for the group. donald trump jr. spoke optimistically about his father’s campaign, arguing that he was demonstrating strength in even traditionally democratic areas, according to one attendee. the thursday event comes as many republican donors continue to grapple with which trump super pac to give to. another group, great america pac, recently hosted a fundraiser in trump tower that was attended by another trump son, eric. and this week, it was revealed that two of the republican party’s biggest donors, casino mogul sheldon adelson and td ameritrade founder joe ricketts, would contribute to a third anti-hillary clinton group, future45. with many republican donors keeping their distance from trump, none of the pro-trump super pacs have raised anywhere near as much money as the pro-hillary clinton priorities usa. to date, priorities usa has taken in over $133 million.      trump jr. to headline super pac fundraiser      
__label__0 minutes before ted cruz took the stage at the republican national convention in cleveland, texas lt. gov. dan patrick cornered the senator, huddling with him in a last-ditch effort to coax an endorsement of donald trump. it didn’t work. “a missed opportunity,” patrick fumed after cruz's notorious snub. "he makes his own decisions.” story continued below two months later, amid political troubles home in texas, unyielding pressure from the republican establishment in washington and growing irritation from the conservative grass roots, cruz reversed course. the senator gave his imprimatur to a man he once called a “pathological liar” and a “bully” during their bitter primary campaign. after telling voters to “vote your conscience” in july, cruz said he had plumbed his own. “if clinton wins, we know — with 100% certainty — that she would deliver on her left-wing promises, with devastating results for our country. my conscience tells me i must do whatever i can to stop that,” cruz said on facebook friday. his about-face stunned the political world and supporters who've flocked to his no-compromise conservatism. but so much had changed in the past 60 days that cruz apparently believed he had no other choice than to bust out of the political box he had built for himself in ohio. at the time of his convention speech, there was compelling political logic for the ambitious firebrand to steer clear of trump. cruz appears likely to run for president again, and trump, at the time, looked like was headed toward a blowout loss. not to mention, trump had essentially called cruz's wife unattractive and erroneously linked his father to jfk’s assassination. cruz's allies believed if he played it right, he could emerge from the election as one of the last principled conservatives — the final bulwark against a candidate who violated many of the values conservatives hold dear. but with trump approaching hillary clinton in the polls, cruz’s diss had become more of a liability: a narrow trump loss might have been pinned on cruz for keeping conservatives home on election day because they were following his lead. in recent days, strong signals emerged that the two rivals were warming to one another. privately, cruz huddled with mike pence last week. trump backed cruz’s effort on a legislative play involving internet regulation, then floated close cruz ally sen. mike lee (r-utah) for the supreme court. cruz praised trump on twitter. those moves by trump, a source familiar with the process, were what made the difference for cruz. "trump's willingness and decisive action to release a list of conservative jurists, particularly including mike lee, with the promise to choose from that list, was a top factor in cruz's ultimate decision," the person said on saturday morning. by friday afternoon, cruz caved and trump celebrated, despite having once said that he wouldn’t accept a cruz endorsement even if it was offered. "the things that bind them together is what's most important: their love for the country, their fear of a hillary clinton presidency," said kellyanne conway, trump's campaign manager and a former president of a pro-cruz super pac. "this is a very big fish because these were the last two guys standing." the endorsement took weeks to come together, people involved said. there was a long, subtle pitch from trump’s camp to cruz's people appealing to the senator's commitment to principle, and even suggestions that cruz might be held responsible if clinton wins. sources within the campaign said pence and cruz made considerable progress during their meeting on sept. 13, helping to set the stage for the eventual endorsement. and cruz, they said, was also feeling pressure from the donor class, including the powerful—and once pro-cruz-- mercer family, which publicly reminded cruz of his commitment to support the gop nominee. still, there are limits to their alliance: cruz and trump didn't speak in advance of the endorsement, campaign sources say, though they talked afterward. cruz’s brand of “principled” conservatism has been predicated on never bending to political pressure, and he's spent his years in the senate criticizing senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and other republican leaders for bending to the will of democrats and lobbyists. now that could all be compromised. “i frankly just don’t understand it at all,” said someone who works for cruz on friday. “you have to stick to your guns. what does ted get out of this now? frankly, what does trump get out of it? he gets an unpopular person.” in an interview friday, conway noted the tension within cruz’s own camp. there was "enormous pressure on sen. cruz to not endorse,” she said. but remaining a holdout “would be an abrogation of the commitment he made a year ago," in his pledge to support the republican nominee. cruz was caught between two whirling forces in the gop: the conservative movement he led just five months ago and a republican party now finding itself actually unifying after a bizarre and divisive primary election seemed to threaten the party’s very existence. former cruz aides wanted their onetime boss to stand strong. rick tyler, a former cruz spokesman, said on thursday that “there is enormous pressure to get on board [with trump] but if he does, he's done.” “if he announces he endorses, it destroys his political brand,” said someone who had worked for cruz's campaign. cruz’s political calculation was exceedingly complicated. he’s now at risk of facing a real primary challenge in 2018 from rep. mike mccaul (r-texas), a deep-pocketed republican who could draw backing from the gop establishment in texas. and cruz’s standing in texas has taken a significant hit since his refusal to endorse trump, with some polls showing him vulnerable in his senate primary. but cruz, at least publicly, has come to see the election as the binary choice republicans have been citing all along as they fall in line behind trump: the business mogul isn’t their first choice, but he’s better than clinton. “if you don’t want to see a hillary clinton presidency, i encourage you to vote for” trump, cruz wrote friday. for some in the gop, cruz will be known as a good party soldier. but others were plainly dejected. glenn beck called it a “profoundly sad day for me,” former cruz speechwriter amanda carpenter could only muster that the turn of events was “very disappointing.” top political aide jason johnson’s only comment was a photo of himself, covering his eyes. other republicans said that the bizarre arc of cruz and trump’s relationship was less about winning the election — and more about egos. “the people who are disposed to vote for donald trump are going to vote for donald trump regardless of who is or is not endorsing him,” said a republican senator. “i don’t know that all of a sudden you’ll see this groundswell of people” supporting trump. steve deace, a conservative radio host who was instrumental in cruz’s iowa caucus win, summed up the feeling that many cruz loyalists were grappling with as the decision came down on friday: "this is gonna be a political disaster," he said. "sad. unavoidable. entirely self-inflicted." shane goldmacher contributed to this report.      how cruz got from 'vote your conscience' to 'vote for trump'      
__label__0 in march, in a bold “oh yeah?” moment during an interview with the washington post’s editorial board, donald trump took the paper’s dare and revealed, then and there, his very short list of foreign policy advisers. there were just five, though he said, “i have quite a few more.” the list was a head-scratcher, a random assortment of obscure and questionable pundits. one of the names, offered without elaboration, was, “carter page, phd.” who? story continued below reporters quickly googling found that page is the founder and managing partner of an investment fund called global energy capital, and that he claims to have years of experience investing in russia and the energy sector. as for his connection to trump, when page was reached for comment by the new york times the day after trump’s big reveal, he said he had been sending policy memos to the campaign and the paper said he “will be advising mr. trump on energy policy and russia.” this piqued my interest: i have been a russia wonk for most of my adult life, i spent years living and reporting from moscow, still go there regularly for reporting trips, and am in touch with lots of friends there. and yet, despite the tightly knit nature of the expat business community in russia, no one i spoke to had ever heard of carter page. “what’s this guy’s name?” says one former western energy ceo who spent years in russia, and would have overlapped there with page. “i had not heard of carter page before it came out in the media,” says another prominent western businessman who has worked in the former soviet union for over two decades. “but i am getting a lot of emails from friends asking, ‘have you heard of this guy?’” “strangely, i've never heard of carter page until this trump connection,” bill browder responded to me in an email. he was one of the biggest western players in the russian market until president vladimir putin turned on him and browder became his fierce critic. “it's odd, because i've heard of every other financier who was a player on moscow at the time.” someone, apparently, has heard of him: on friday, yahoo news reported that page was being probed by u.s. intelligence for purported back-channel ties to russian leaders. the story resurfaced the name of a character who’d all but vanished from the campaign, and reawakened questions about who, exactly, trump was surrounding himself with. this has been a concern swirling around the outsider candidate since he began, a real-estate developer with almost no serious washington connections to tap for advice. “i’m going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people," trump famously told a post reporter last summer about how he would staff his campaign. "we want top-of-the-line professionals.” as the primaries unfolded, it became increasingly obvious that trump would need all the top-of-the-line help he could get when it came to foreign policy. in an interview with conservative radio host hugh hewitt, trump confused the kurds with the iranian al-quds force, couldn’t tell the difference between hezbollah and hamas, and couldn’t recognize the name of the leader of isis. (in his defense, trump said that “hugh was giving me name after name, arab name, arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere, that would have known those names.”) the republican foreign policy specialists who would normally be a brain trust began slamming him in the press or publicly signing on to anti-trump manifestos. and since they increasingly were fleeing the candidate, who were the people who would line up to advise him instead? what would they be like? enter carter page, a 44-year-old ph.d., and business school graduate who claims an expertise in russia and energy, yet who, i quickly discovered, was known by neither russia experts nor energy experts nor russian energy experts. (“i can poll any number of people involved in energy in russia about carter page and they’ll say, ‘carter who? you mean jimmy carter?’” says one veteran western investor in russian energy.) page also, as i would be surprised to discover, appears largely unknown to trump’s own campaign. what i did find, however, is that while page might not be helping trump, trump has been a significant help to page. since being named by trump as an adviser, page, who has spent his career trying to put together energy deals in russia and the former soviet union, has finally begun to be noticed in the region. he is being treated in russia as a person with potentially important ties in america. “he’s an extremely well-informed, authoritative expert on russia,” says mikhail leontiev, a pro-kremlin talking head and spokesman for rosneft, russia’s state oil giant. “people really respect him in this industry. he’s a very serious guy, and he has a good reputation.” according to the yahoo report, u.s. intelligence believes page had an audience with top russian officials—including rosneft head igor sechin—during a summer trip to moscow. from what i could find about him, it’s hard to imagine he could have secured those meetings without that mention by trump. page has also been the subject of some breathless coverage in the american press. a march bloomberg profile touted his “deep ties” with “executives at gazprom,” the state-owned russian gas giant, whom he says he advised on some of its biggest deals of the past decade. last month, the post ran a piece that was breathless in a different way, casting him as a shadowy broker with potentially important ties in russia, some of them unsavory. the yahoo story also portrays page as a well-connected, high-rolling businessman with “extensive business interests in russia” and an office “around the corner from trump tower.” page has fueled all this by making some remarkable statements, including saying putin is a better leader than president barack obama to a june closed-door meeting of foreign policy brahmins in washington. in july, in moscow, he spoke at the new economic school’s commencement ceremony, a university that had hosted obama just seven years ago. page used the speech to slam the “hypocrisy” of american foreign policy in front of a russian audience, saying, “washington and other western powers have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.” he is now frequently quoted on russian television, which hails him as a “famous american economist” and “adviser to donald trump on questions of foreign policy.” all of which reveals something deeply strange about trump: when he shoots from the hip, his remarks do more than just whip up twitter controversies. they also occasionally and unintentionally mint a new species of “insiders,” people who seem to be in trump’s orbit but who may not have—and may never have had—any access to the gilded inner sanctum at all. but someone is paying attention. as i started looking into page, i began getting calls from two separate “corporate investigators” digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections page has to all kinds of shady russians. one is working on behalf of various unnamed democratic donors; the other won’t say who turned him on to page’s scent. both claimed to me that the fbi was investigating page for allegedly meeting with igor sechin and sergei ivanov, who was until recently putin’s chief of staff—both of whom are on the sanctions list—when page was in moscow in july for that speech. so the question continued to linger: who is carter page? *** i should tell you before we get any further that page wouldn’t talk to me for this story. i called his fund and left messages, both on the general line and his personal voice mail. i emailed him repeatedly. i asked the trump campaign to put me in touch. i emailed the bloomberg journalist who interviewed him, who passed the request on. i even called carter page’s father in poughkeepsie, new york, who told me he would ask his son to talk to me. but alas, no dice. this was disappointing: no one who worked in moscow when page was there seemed to know who he was, and i just wanted to talk to someone who did. at a certain point, i just needed confirmation that he even existed. ok, i thought. try a different route. maybe all these prominent western businessmen who worked in russia for decades didn’t know page, but maybe it was because some of them worked in different spheres of the russian economy. he did, after all, have such an impressive résumé. page’s biography on the website of his energy fund, global energy capital, hits all the right notes. it was, at first glance, the résumé of an up-and-coming player in the opaque but lucrative russian energy market. “he spent 7 years as an investment banker at merrill lynch in london, moscow and new york where he most recently served as chief operating officer of the energy and power group,” his bio reads. “he was involved in over $25 billion of transactions in the energy and power sector. he spent 3 years in moscow where he was responsible for the opening of the merrill office and was an advisor on key transactions for gazprom, rao ues and others.” those were some of the biggest energy deals of the 2000s, and page’s tenure in merrill lynch’s moscow office, from 2004 to 2007, would have put him in the right place at the right time. he says he was part of the carving up of rao ues, a massive russian electric power holding company. he told bloomberg that he advised gazprom when it bought a stake in the sakhalin ii oil and gas project. those were huge, huge things. if he were deeply involved, he would definitely count as a player. and surely he left at least a trace in the records of those deals. so i called ian craig, the ceo of sakhalin energy from 2004 to 2009, who was doing the negotiations with gazprom and stayed on as ceo after the deal went through. (it wasn’t really a deal, to be clear: sakhalin ii was a large project in the far east, and gazprom essentially elbowed its way into the project when the government forced the consortium to sell the gas giant a controlling stake.) but craig said he didn’t know anyone named carter page. he was also surprised to hear about merrill lynch’s purported involvement in the deal. “i don’t think merrill lynch or anyone else was front-lining the negotiations, because it was all done at the highest level, because it was very political,” says craig . “it closed at ceo level, and eventually putin himself signed off on it.” when i asked a prominent western businessman, who has worked in the former soviet union for over two decades and who is said to socialize with sechin and other members of the russian elite, about page’s claim to bloomberg that he advised gazprom on sakhalin ii, he said, “i rolled my eyes at that one.” (he, too, said he hadn’t heard of page until trump’s announcement.) fine. ok. maybe page exaggerated a bit on that one. but what about the reorganization and privatization of rao ues, the russian electricity giant? maybe some of the russians he worked with remembered a carter page? turns out, they did. “his nickname was stranichkin,” from the russian word stranichka, or “little page,” says artem torchinsky, who met page during the breakup of rao ues. torchinsky, who was part of the company’s financial department, worked alongside page, who, at the time worked in merrill lynch’s moscow office. it was 2007, and merrill lynch was underwriting the sale of one part of rao ues, and torchinsky was resentful of page and the other merrill lynchers: torchinsky and the in-house team did all the work, and page and his team would swoop in to give the presentation. they were the fancy western window dressing. “it really irritated our team,” torchinsky told me over skype. “we worked around the clock, and then they would come in and say something incomprehensible and we’d have to correct them. these guys didn’t know what they were talking about.” as for page, “he made no impression whatsoever. whether he was there or not, it made no difference,” torchinsky says. “when you’re dealing with a pro, you see it. page, unfortunately, did not leave that impression.” ok, harsh. but then i talked to page’s former boss, former russian central bank chairman sergei aleksashenko, who ran the moscow office of merrill lynch for part of the time page worked there. “he wasn’t great and he wasn’t terrible,” aleksashenko says, exasperated and confused by the interest of all these journalists pestering him for information about someone “without any special talents or accomplishments,” someone who was “a gray spot.” “what can you say about a person who in no way [is] exceptional?” he asked me. page was a vice president at merrill lynch in moscow, which sounds senior but is a common title in the finance world; a big firm like merrill lynch might have thousands of vps. in the moscow office, there were five ranks, and vp was right in the middle. in effect, it was “just the oldest of the youngest, three from the bottom,” says aleksashenko. when it came to finance, aleksashenko says, page “was not a specialist in any branches of finance or in any instruments.” when it came to energy, page and his team were, according to torchinsky, “mildly speaking, not competent in the field of energy.” and, says aleksashenko, “judging by the drivel he spews on russia, you can tell he doesn’t really understand the topic.” trump’s putative adviser on russia and energy and foreign policy, in other words, “did not create the impression of someone who was intellectual or well-educated, or someone who was in any way interested or knowledgeable in foreign policy,” says aleksashenko. *** for the past few years, page has styled himself a foreign policy expert. he has written columns in global policy journal, a new peer-reviewed journal run out of durham university. they are confoundingly written and make logically curious leaps. “in recent months, renewed calls for equal justice have brought social tension across the united states after the killing of michael brown and eric garner by police officers in missouri and new york respectively,” he wrote. “although commonly overlooked, the impact of other fatal mistakes by government officials in the foreign policy arena might vastly outweigh these tragic deaths in potentially catastrophic proportions.” he is the kind of thinker who writes that kanye west’s “new slaves” and the “artist’s creative work offers valuable ideas that could fundamentally improve the direction of u.s. foreign policy and world affairs” but does it by opening with a citation from the oxford english dictionary (“slave; pronunciation: /slāv/…”), roping in adam sandler, william f. buckley and dick cheney. his speech in moscow’s new economic school was a similar construction of empty spaces held together with repetition, tautologies, and abuses of the word “ironically.” “for the last 15 years, i’ve been researching, teaching, and writing about fundamental trends in the world economy, which have really continued to evolve in this period and in the years immediately preceding it,” he began. the video of the speech also suggests that after three years living there and a lifetime studying the place, he couldn’t really speak russian—he had to have his questions translated for him into english. except to quote, haltingly, brokenly, vladimir putin: “we never meddle in the internal political affairs of other countries. unlike the usa.” which is troubling for two reasons: that the adviser of a presidential candidate of a major party is criticizing america abroad by citing putin, and that the comment implied that he seemed to not know anything about anything going on in, say, syria or ukraine. page also managed to find his way into a fellowship at the council on foreign relations, where he cut a strange figure. like other westerners doing business in russia, page took the view that putin was not the blood-stained and corrupt tyrant some in the west imagine him to be, defending him as a strong leader who brought order and prosperity to russia. but unlike other entrepreneurial defenders of putin, people at the council recall that page was not particularly good at it. “he had a guilty-seeming style in making these arguments, making it seem like he didn’t really want to engage,” one person from the council says. his columns made the rounds and raised eyebrows. “that blog post about the slaves. that’s just … strange,” says the council member. “he’s a nice guy, but of the people that i know that have russian foreign policy experience or access and contacts, he wouldn’t be in the last decile, but he’d be in the second-to-last decile,” says one american executive with experience in russia and its energy sector. “you’d have to dip really far and wide to find a guy like carter page. i mean, wow.” *** i should’ve just dropped the carter page story, but in the months since trump named him an adviser, the campaign’s russia connections have become a bigger and bigger issue. fancy bear, who was probably a russian hacker, broke into the democratic national committee emails, seemingly handed them over to julian assange, who continues to leak the information in a way that is clearly designed to help one campaign and hurt the other. trump’s second campaign manager, paul manafort, flamed out in august because of his shady business dealings with the pro-kremlin side of ukraine, and trump himself continues to say absurd things about russia and putin, like publicly inviting the russian government to continue hacking american servers. washington was in full hunt for red october mode, and it was all i could do to stay on page’s trail, which began to look more and more like an infinity sign. i was not the only one. seemingly everyone i talked to had also talked to the washington post, and then there were these corporate investigators who drew a dark and complex web of page’s connections. then there was page, praising putin. i found myself juggling two mutually contradictory page narratives: was page, like manafort, followed by a long train of sordid dealings with dark and powerful players with deep pockets and deep resentments toward the west? this was the person described by the corporate investigators trying to whisper into my ear. was page a man wheeling and dealing in energy contracts with china and turkmenistan, who was a vehicle for the kremlin to influence the american election? was he a man who, during a three-day trip to moscow, met with two of russia’s most powerful men and was now being investigated for it? but it was hard to see that man when i actually talked to people who knew him. page made his way into the financial sector as it ballooned in the early part of the past decade, securing a spot at merrill lynch’s london and moscow offices. today, he claims he was cozy with gazprom executives; his former colleagues laugh at the suggestion. “no one let him into gazprom,” aleksashenko says. “he didn’t go shake [gazprom chief alexey] miller’s hand. he made sure there were cars, hotels and meetings for investors in london.” another of page’s colleagues from merrill lynch confirmed that page’s role was simply arranging meetings between gazprom and western investors, something normally done by analysts, the lowest rank on the totem pole. “people organize meetings with gazprom all the time,” the former colleague said. “he hosted these guys in new york city but they would have done this 10 times a year… i used to do this; it doesn’t require all that much skill. you just send out an email to 20 people saying gazprom agreed to dinner at this place at 8 p.m., do you want to come? the main thing is just getting those two [gazprom] guys to agree. but because they agreed doesn’t mean they’re close to him.” but the meetings did provide him with something else. “gazprom didn’t need money at the time,” says the former colleague. “they were the most profitable company at the time. their net profit was something like $36 billion a year. their problem was not getting investors, but figuring out how to spend money in a non-efficient way if you read between the lines. he was probably aware of that. he would have known how inefficient and wasteful the company is.” page became an investor in the company, and has, according to filings, advised other companies he’s worked for to invest in them. after merrill lynch, page tried to set up his own fund to invest in energy projects and called it global energy capital. but he tried to do this in 2008, and we know what happened to the markets in 2008. the fund is registered to his father’s address in poughkeepsie; page listed himself as “founder and managing partner,” even though the only other partner seemed to be sergei yatsenko, who was once a mid-level executive at gazprom. he also maintained a website and handed out business cards that listed a fancy madison avenue address—that’s the one “around the corner from trump tower”— which was actually the address of a co-working space. “that’s carter page,” says an american businessman who has spent nearly a decade working in russia. “that’s what he’s been doing, without any actual funding, without any actual experience, without any actual connections or core capabilities, he’s been trying to throw together these deals. he’s always been operating at a level far beneath that at which business in russia is done. i admire that, it takes a lot of gumption.” in the interest of due diligence, i also tried to run down the rumors being handed me by the corporate investigators: that russia’s alfa bank paid for the trip as a favor to the kremlin; that page met with sechin and ivanov in moscow; that he is now being investigated by the fbi for those meetings because sechin and ivanov were both sanctioned for russia’s invasion of ukraine. “i don’t know this person,” said pyotr aven, one of the two founders of alfa bank, which is considered the western russian bank. aven and his partner, mikhail fridman, have transferred much of their assets out of russia and have been quite critical of putin. as for who paid for page’s trip, aven was no less irritated by the question. “i give them money, i don’t know how they spend it, who they invite, when they invite them, i have no idea,” he said of the new economic school, which hosted page and of which aven is the main benefactor. exasperated by my questions, he snapped, “don’t bring these russian-style conspiracy theories to me.” “you are engaged in onanism,” said leontiev, the spokesman for rosneft and sechin when i asked him if page had met with sechin. “it’s bullshit. just bullshit. you need to understand who sechin is to even ask this question. it’s hard to have a meeting with him at all. it’s absurd.” as for the fbi investigation, well, it’s unclear. a state department official who works on russia sanctions but was not authorized to speak on the record told me that, for one thing, there is “no prohibition meeting with a designated [sanctioned] individual. moreover, sanctions violations are not criminal in nature and not enforced by the fbi. ofac runs them.” he added, “the story doesn't add up.” what does seem to have happened is that various u.s. intelligence agencies were looking into page’s time in moscow, then briefed senate minority leader, democrat harry reid, who wrote a letter to fbi director james comey asking him to investigate, among other things, “whether a trump advisor who has been highly critical of u.s. and european economic sanctions on russia, and who has conflicts of interest due to investments in russian energy conglomerate gazprom, met with high-ranking sanctioned individuals while in moscow in july of 2016, well after trump became the presumptive republican nominee.” *** i got my next surprise when i called stephen miller, trump’s senior adviser. i caught him just as the trump plane was about to take off, and asked him the tired, old question: who is carter page? “who?” says miller, and then went off the record to expound on his lack of involvement in the campaign. “he has no formal role in the campaign,” hope hicks texted responding to my question. now my interest was piqued. there were whispers all over washington that, despite hicks’s denial, page was not only still part of the trump campaign, but its conduit for russian influence. was he? one way to answer the question was to figure out how he even got on that list to begin with. one source suggested to me that richard burt, former u.s. ambassador to germany, start treaty negotiator, and longtime lobbyist for alfa bank, was the nexus. it was burt who helped draft trump’s foreign policy speech in april, and had been advising the trump campaign, via senator jeff sessions, on foreign policy. but when i met burt at his office at the mclarty associates lobbying shop, he looked at me and said he had never even met him. “the only person i talked to about carter page is this guy at the washington post,” burt told me. “and i told him i’d never met the guy. let me put it this way: if i have met him, i’ve forgotten. he’s the former merrill lynch guy, right?” someone else told me that the page connection was rick dearborn, sessions’ chief of staff, who hired page because dearborn knew nothing about foreign policy but needed to put together a foreign policy staff for trump’s alexandria, virginia, policy shop and he happened to know page. but dearborn wouldn’t return my calls, and someone who once worked for that policy shop told me it was neither dearborn nor burt, but campaign co-chair sam clovis who recruited page. “if he was part of that original group of people, i can say with 70 percent confidence it was sam clovis,” this person told me. “i’m not answering your questions,” clovis told me. he refused to tell me if he was the one who found page, but jason miller, the campaign’s other spokesperson, says, “carter page isn’t someone i’ve interacted with.” which confirmed what a policy staffer on the trump campaign told me: “carter is a red herring, not a rasputin. he’s never met trump, never briefed him. he has zero influence, none.” *** was page the shadowy messenger between the kremlin and trump tower, or was he the nebbishy, not-very-successful man trying to profit from the arbitrage between what trump said—he’s my adviser—and what his associates said—“who?” maybe i wasn’t doing this right, and maybe everyone was lying to me, but it was hard not to come to the conclusion that, regardless of whatever game the russians were running, page was firmly in the latter camp. “i don’t know about his russia fund, other than it’s never really materialized,” says the prominent player in the energy space whom page has pitched on various energy projects. “every conversation i’ve had with carter has not been terribly serious. they’ve all been pie-in-the-sky ideas. there are usually issues with traction and execution capabilities.” he went on. “i couldn’t name a project that i could connect carter’s name to, any project that actually happened.” “i don’t know how he’s earned a living off this,” the energy player says, “but i think he’s been trying to be an intermediary. if you hang around russia long enough, it’s sort of like a pinball machine, something will hit you.” strangely, it was not a russian pinball that hit him; it was trump. according to the trump policy adviser, this winter, clovis began to draw up a list of people who could serve as policy advisers to the campaign and give it some intellectual and policy heft. at a time when established republican foreign policy specialists were tripping over each other to get away from trump, “a lot of people came to sam clovis in february, march, and said, ‘i want to be part of the team,’” says the trump adviser. and that’s how it happened. “he’s just a guy on a list. trump looked at the list and said, ‘he’s an adviser.’ and now he’s milking it for all it’s worth.” now, someone whom no one in the field had ever heard of was suddenly a very important person in washington—or at least could plausibly market himself as one. “i was not aware of him at all until he was named to the campaign, and even after that, i had never heard of him,” one russia specialist in washington told me. he saw page at a washington roundtable in june for indian prime minister narendra modi, and what he saw was a strange kind of person: one who was very differential to everyone there “in a way that someone who is junior would use it to network,” but who was dropping hints full of meaning to anyone who would listen—and be impressed. “he was saying he was planning to go to moscow,” the russia specialist recalls. “he didn’t say what he was going to do there, but he created the impression that there could be some meaning to the trip.” according to a congressional leadership staffer familiar with the intelligence briefings on page’s trip to russia, “the meetings did happen and that’s been established as a fact. i think the investigation is more what happened in them.” but it remained unclear, the staffer told me unprompted, what this even meant. “it’s not just did he met with them or not, but now looking into the bigger question of what the hell is going on?” said the staffer. “is he acting as a conduit in ways that are against america’s national security interests? wittingly or un-, i should add. it’s what’s hard to parse about this. is he doing this with nefarious intent or is this just about guys who are thrilled to be living in a john le carré novel? or are they being played by much smarter people in the kremlin?” this seems to be vintage carter page, a man whose story never quite adds up, as much as he tries to make the numbers work. but he’s also mastered the art of manipulating the distance between his story as it is and his story as he wants it to be, playing on the uncertainty in between to make himself seem more successful, more connected, even more evil than he really is—and to try to turn a profit off of that. “if page using his status as ‘trump advisor’ for personal gain, that’s another matter: time for page to join twitter!” michael mcfaul, former u.s. ambassador to russia, tweeted after news of the investigation broke. the russians may be feeling out the trump campaign via page, but page must be loving every minute of it. after all, meeting russia’s energy czar is an impossible dream for a would-be investor struggling to make it in the world of russian energy—but the dream entered the realm of the possible when trump said three words in march: “carter page, ph.d.” now carter page, ph.d., has found a perfect candidate to latch on to, like a pilot fish feeding off the carnage wrought by the oblivious trump shark. for months now, the american press has been twisting itself in knots trying to explain men like page and manafort, and, through them, to answer the questions of whether putin is trying to destroy america by their hands, and is trump a kremlin stooge or a just a useful idiot, and is there even a difference? there doesn’t seem to be one in the world of trump, which in some ways resembles putin’s: the waters of truth are muddy and deeply suggestive. and that is all that matters. is putin actually meddling in our election and undermining the foundations of western democracy in a massive way, or doing just enough to make us think he is, and thereby acquiring powers he holds only because we believe him to have them? “i want to hope that this is connected with the growing influence and significance of russia,” putin says of the rumors of russian meddling in the american election—as we in the media continue to squeegee them around, rarely really getting closer to the truth, and watching it disintegrate in our hands when we think we’ve finally grasped it.      the mystery of trump’s man in moscow      
__label__0 charlotte mayor jennifer roberts on friday called for donald trump and hillary clinton to delay their planned trips to the north carolina city in the wake of three days of protests that she says have strained local resources. while expressing appreciation for the candidates' concerns for the city, roberts told cnn's erin burnett that charlotte has "very stressed resources for security." story continued below "if there would be a way to delay these visits in terms of giving us a chance to get our city back to order and back to more of a state of normalcy, that would probably be ideal," she said. clinton's campaign announced earlier friday that the candidate would visit charlotte sunday, however, in a statement released later friday, clinton campaign communications director jennifer palmieri confirmed that the visit had been postponed. "hillary is grateful for, and intends to honor, the invitation from faith leaders to visit with the charlotte community. after further discussion with community leaders, we have decided to postpone sunday's trip as to not impact the city's resources. she will plan to visit charlotte next sunday, provided circumstances allow. in the meantime her prayers are with the people of charlotte during these difficult days." donald trump quickly responded to clinton's reversal, tweeting that clinton was trying to "grandstand" and calling her initial decision to go to charlotte "dumb." "crooked hillary's bad judgement forced her to announce that she would go to charlotte on saturday to grandstand. dem pols said no way, dumb!" trump was reportedly considering going to charlotte next week but has not elaborated on those plans. he incorrectly identified clinton's initial trip as scheduled for saturday. clinton has called for charlotte police to release video footage of the confrontation between officers and keith lamont scott, the african-american man whose fatal shooting by a police officer tuesday ignited recent protests. clinton wrote on twitter friday: "charlotte should release police video of the keith lamont scott shooting without delay. we must ensure justice & work to bridge divides." charlotte should release police video of the keith lamont scott shooting without delay. we must ensure justice & work to bridge divides. -h — hillary clinton (@hillaryclinton) september 23, 2016  roberts, who favors releasing the video as long as it does not impinge the "integrity" of the investigation, also weighed in friday on the ongoing controversy over whether scott was carrying a weapon, as officers have claimed. "i think all three videos have obscured or blurred or it is not precise enough view of what was actually going on," she said. "so i it remains inconclusive in my opinion."      charlotte mayor asks trump, clinton to delay trips to city      
__label__0 hillary clinton’s campaign on friday held a conference call urging reporters to “lift up the lies” it expects donald trump will tell at monday's debate. capitol hill republicans leaked news that former clinton aide cheryl mills had been granted partial immunity in the fbi’s email investigation. democrats and republicans alike are aiming to influence the debate before the candidates take the stage, with clinton officials targeting trump’s slipperiness with the facts and republicans taking aim at clinton’s struggles with transparency. story continued below and in their own ways, both sides are aiming to make the debate a referendum on which candidate american voters can trust. “donald trump has shown a clear pattern of repeating provably false lies and hoping no one corrects him,” clinton’s communications director jennifer palmieri said in a statement friday. “voters and viewers should keep track: any candidate who tells this many lies clearly can’t win the debate on the merits.” the trust issue continues to be the major stumbling block for both candidates. a recent cbs/nyt poll showed that 63 percent of likely voters believe clinton is not honest or trustworthy, and 60 percent of voters who view trump as untrustworthy. as a pre-buttal to the debate, the clinton campaign laid out seven lies that they say trump should be fact-checked on in real time, including his claim that he has always opposed the war in iraq (a statement left wholly unchallenged by nbc host matt lauer in a presidential forum earlier this month). meanwhile, republicans expressed outrage at the latest news from inside the fbi’s investigation of clinton’s email use at the state department. the immunity deal for mills and another former clinton aide, heather samuelson, were narrow and covered only their handover of laptops used in 2014 when they were sorting clinton’s work-related and personal emails. it did not cover any of their statements to the fbi. but that didn't stop the outrage from those trying to prevent clinton from winning the white house. “the fact that hillary clinton’s top aide and attorney was granted immunity by the fbi is shocking,” rnc chairman reince priebus said in a statement. “we now know it wasn’t mere it staffers that were given a pass, but individuals at the highest levels of this dangerous scheme that jeopardized national security.” trump’s former campaign manager corey lewandowski, who remains on his campaign's payroll, tweeted; “who needs this if no laws broken?” clinton campaign officials downplayed the revelation, calling it old information from a closed case that was being leaked for political reasons. “house republicans are trying to make something out of nothing by rummaging through the files of a justice department investigation that was closed months ago, and leaking selective details three days before the first presidential debate,” said clinton spokesman brian fallon. they predicted the mills revelation would be a “non-factor” by monday night, and noted that cable news wasn’t even picking up the story on a busy news day filled with cell phone footage of a fatal police shooting in charlotte, n.c. some clinton allies, however, worried that lewandowski wasn’t completely wrong in his assessment -- that the previously undisclosed immunity deal, however narrow, fed into the narrative that the clintons try to hide information in the hopes of gliding past it. “how is it not like pneumonia?” said one clinton ally worried it gave the appearance of wrong-doing. “it leads to the interference that her top aides needed it. why did they keep it a secret?” and the ill-timed leak guaranteed that clinton will not cross the finish line of the election, now just 46 days away, shaking free of the email scandal. but clinton’s debate prep team, insiders said, has already been anticipating that trump will grill her hardest on her emails, and don't expect the tidbit of new information to change the narrative. one longtime clinton ally familiar with the process said the candidate typically spends most of the time in debate prep “working and reworking the answers to the difficult questions.” in this case, the ally said, that section would include “anything to do with the foundation, anything to do with your illness, and everything to do with your email.”      trump, clinton take aim at trust issues      
__label__0 hillary clinton's campaign announced late friday that it was postponing a trip by the democratic nominee to charlotte scheduled for sunday. "after further discussion with community leaders, we have decided to postpone sunday's trip as not to impact the city's resources," clinton communications director jennifer palmieri wrote in a statement. "she will plan to visit charlotte next sunday, provided circumstances allow." story continued below the rescheduling comes after charlotte mayor jennifer roberts made a public plea to clinton and donald trump to delay any campaign trips to the city in light of their "very stressed resources." clinton's campaign had announced the trip earlier friday. palmieri added: "her prayers are with the people of charlotte during these difficult times." donald trump wasted no time in responding to clinton's reversal on social media, accusing his opponent of trying to "grandstand" and calling her initial decision to go to charlotte "dumb." "crooked hillary's bad judgement forced her to announce that she would go to charlotte on saturday to grandstand. dem pols said no way, dumb!" the republican nominee tweeted late friday. trump was reportedly considering traveling to charlotte next week following the presidential debate monday, but has not elaborated on those plans. he incorrectly identified clinton's initial trip as scheduled for saturday. protests have erupted in charlotte since keith lamont scott was shot dead by police tuesday afternoon. the outcry over yet another officer-involved killing of a black person, days after an officer in tulsa, oklahoma, shot and killed terence crutcher, who was unarmed and had his hands up when he was fatally struck, turned violent late wednesday into thursday morning, prompting north carolina gov. pat mccrory to issue a state of emergency. earlier friday, the democratic presidential nominee called on police to release the video of the shooting — after scott’s family had released its own cellphone video recorded by scott’s wife, rakeyia scott. “charlotte should release police video of the keith lamont scott shooting without delay. we must ensure justice & work to bridge divides,” she wrote on twitter, signing her message with “-h” to denote it came from her, not her campaign.      clinton postpones trip to charlotte      
__label__0 a lawyer for hillary clinton told a house committee friday the panel won't be receiving some information it subpoenaed about security arrangements for clinton's server. clinton attorney david kendall sent a letter to house science committee chairman lamar smith (r-texas) saying that the panel's subpoena to florida-based computer security company secnap went too far by demanding details on safeguards in place after clinton emails from her time as secretary state were removed from the server in 2014. "documents regarding this equipment are likely to contain sensitive information related to security of the current network and/or server," kendall added. "because these documents are unrelated to the committee's investigation and contain sensitive security information, i respectfully object to the portion of the subpoena seeking their production." a spokeswoman for smith did not immediately respond to a request friday night seeking comment on kendall's letter. smith has been pressing for records from the fbi and private firms as part of his panel's investigation into the security vulnerabilities of the private system clinton used to store the tens of thousands of emails she exchanged while secretary. other house and senate committee are conducting similar inquiries. when the house oversight committee called in computer technicians from the clintons' main computer contractor platte river networks last week, smith was granted special permission to sit on the dais. he said his panel was being denied information because of resistance from clinton and her attorneys. "secnap counsel confirmed to my staff that the clinton's private llc is actively engaged in directing their obstructionist responses to congressional subpoenas. this is a clear obstruction of justice. americans deserve to know the truth, which is now being blocked by the clinton organization," smith said. a former clinton aide, justin cooper, did testify at that hearing, but the questioning of the computer technicians was to no avail since both exercised their fifth amendment rights. asked about kendall's response to the science committee subpoena, a spokeswoman for the panel's ranking democrat rep. eddie bernice johnson of texas had no specific comment, however, the spokeswoman pointed to an earlier statement sharply criticizing the chairman's email-related probe and questioning the panel's jurisdiction over the issue. “i am outraged that the chairman is recklessly abusing the committee’s investigatory powers to brazenly do the bidding of the trump campaign. i am certain that the science committee will not uncover any ‘smoking gun’ after this issue has already been thoroughly investigated by the benghazi committee at a cost of $7 million in taxpayer dollars as well as by the fbi," johnson said. "this committee desperately needs to get back to the work of ensuring continued american leadership in science and innovation and the legitimate oversight of our research and development enterprise.”      clinton lawyer rejects subpoena for current server security details      
__label__0 kim kardashian is still with her. "i found that without a doubt, i stand with hillary. i'm with her," according to a statement released on kardashian's website on saturday. "i believe hillary will best represent our country and is the most qualified for the job. this year, i'm not just voting for myself, but also for my children, and i took that into careful consideration when i made my decision." story continued below a comment surfaced friday where the reality-tv star said she was “on the fence” about the presidential election and thinking about changing her vote to donald trump. according to comments surfaced by the huffington post, kardashian told wonderland magazine that she’s reconsidering her support for hillary clinton in the november election, thanks to a conversation she had with stepparent caitlyn jenner, the transgender olympic athlete formerly known as bruce. jenner is a republican. “at first i thought, ‘oh my god, i’m so hillary [clinton],’ but i had a long political call with caitlyn last night about why she’s voting trump. i’m on the fence,” kardashian said, according to huffpost. just over a year ago, kardashian seemed to endorse clinton, then not yet the democratic party’s nominee, on instagram, posting a selfie with the former secretary of state. kardashian’s husband, recording artist kanye west, peered from behind them in the photo. “i got my selfie!!!” an apparently jubilant kardashian wrote in the post. “i really loved hearing her speak & hearing her goals for our country! #hillaryforpresident.” as of midafternoon friday, the interview posted on wonderland’s website did not include any mention of trump or clinton, but the huffington post reported that it confirmed the statements with the story’s author, eve barlow. an editor at wonderland did not immediately respond to an email from politico seeking clarification. in her conversation with wonderland, kardashian sounded off on a few other political issues — including her recent admission that she does not consider herself a feminist (she doesn’t “like labels”) and her husband’s stated interest in running for president in 2020. (she suggests he would probably run as a democrat, but perhaps an independent. “i don’t know how serious he is about it. we’ll see.”) and asked whether she’s prepared to serve as first lady, kardashian offered: “look at all the awful things they’re doing to melania [trump], putting up the naked photos [of her] … i’ll say to kanye: ‘babe, you know the kind of photos they’d put up of me!’ haha.”      kim kardashian still voting for clinton      
__label__0 donald trump is a creature of television. and as a creature of television, he holds strong opinions about what ought to happen when he steps in front of the cameras. for the 2016 presidential debates, he’s weighed in with a variety of programming suggestions: a debate schedule that does not conflict with nfl games. different moderators. or no moderators at all: “i think that maybe we should just have no moderator. let hillary and i sit there and just debate,” he mused on cnbc’s “squawkbox” earlier this month. radical and unlikely as this last idea may seem, it also raises a fascinating question: why have moderators at all? why don’t we have debates where candidates just face off, one-on-one, without any questioners? such a format could be a radical but useful break from the classic debate structures that have undergirded 50-plus years of presidential history. story continued below format shapes the outcome of debates far more than we realize. some formats are relatively simple for candidates to maneuver, allowing strong candidates to game the system; others keep them more under control? debates are certainly not “rigged,” but a standard two-podium format typically favors a very information-dense candidate like hillary clinton, while a town-hall format gives much more room for a big personality, like trump, to dominate. for voters, too, different formats provide different kinds of information, from character to geniality to areas of expertise. the format monday night is an extremely open one, borrowed from an idea debuted in 2012. even without heeding trump’s recommendation, the rules of engagement for this year’s presidential debates grant the candidates the power to conduct an essentially moderator-less exchange if they really want, allowing one or the other to grab the reins and seize control. on the one hand, this format would seem to benefit a loose performer like trump, who is fully at home in the rough-and-tumble of live tv. on the other, long open exchanges could give clinton a showcase to demonstrate her superior knowledge of policy and government. it might seem like a play for advantage, but trump’s proposal for a debate without moderators is merely the latest entry in a long-running political conversation that has been underway since lincoln met douglas: what is the best way to design and execute a live campaign debate? it’s a surprisingly unsettled question after all these years—and might be poised for some radical changes. *** as both campaigns prepare for the showdown on monday night, they should study the first debate from 2012, when mitt romney handed barack obama the most conclusive drubbing in a presidential debate since richard nixon sweated his way to defeat in 1960. the 2012 debates featured an innovation which, at the time, went nearly unremarked-upon in the press: long, open-ended discussion periods that, in effect, left it to the candidates to decide how the dialogue would unfold. romney prepared specifically for these ground rules and took full advantage on debate night; obama did not. and though much criticism was directed at moderator jim lehrer for approaching his task too passively, in fact, it was obama’s rigidity in a malleable format that produced such a lopsided result. this exact same format will be used on monday, as well as in the third debate, on october 19. clinton and trump will square off in six thematic blocks of 15 minutes apiece on subjects announced by the moderator in advance: this year, the topics will include “america’s direction,” “achieving prosperity” and “securing america.” although the moderator is responsible for introducing topics and ensuring a more or less equal distribution of time, the debaters themselves determine how those 15-minute segments play out. as far back as 1960, debate producers had hoped to install a format that emphasized direct exchange between kennedy and nixon—the so-called oxford-style debate—until campaign handlers vetoed the idea. what happened instead was three decades of a fairly rigid, controlled formula that often reduced the “debates” to parallel news conferences. “the panel's role was hardly more than to designate categories—animal, vegetable, or mineral—on which the two might or might not discourse,” complained one kennedy-nixon panelist afterward. despite the limitations of journalistic panels, the format endured because it imbued the candidates with a sense of security—and kept them from having to confront each other directly. the first carter-ford debate in 1976, for instance, contained virtually no cross-talk by the candidates, who addressed each other only by talking to the moderators. although change has come slowly to presidential debates, it has come. in 1988, for instance, moderators for the first time were allowed to ask an opening question. everyone remembers bernard shaw’s hardball opening question to michael dukakis (“if kitty dukakis were raped and murdered…”), but shaw had a similarly gruesome set-up for george h.w. bush (“if you are elected and die before inauguration day…”). the introduction of town hall debates in 1992 wrought a wholly new format, one that has bedeviled candidates ever since. the town hall can generate positive results—as in 1992 and 2004—or it can be dull and un-insightful—as in 1996 and 2008. it can also encourage candidate aggression, as in the 2012 match between obama and romney. whatever the outcome, town hall is probably the least comfortable format for politicians because it is nearly impossible to game in advance. for that reason, campaign negotiators have imposed increasingly burdensome restrictions over the years on how the town hall functions. the once-freewheeling format of 1992 has been reined in considerably, in the vain hope of protecting the participants. the 1990s also marked the debut of solo moderators in place of panels, giving individual journalists an outsized role in setting the debate agenda. jim lehrer filled that slot for every presidential debate in 1996 and 2000; since 2004, each debate has been helmed by a different moderator. another recent format innovation is the table debate, in which candidates and moderator sit at a table instead of standing at lecterns. table debates can be more conversational than the more formal setup of lectern debates. furthermore, by placing the debaters in close proximity, table debates encourage—at least in theory—a more civilized level of discourse. for dick cheney, table debates were also a practical necessity: with cheney’s history of heart problems, his advisers did not want to risk having him stand for 90 minutes. what we’re going to see on monday will be dramatic and is widely expected to be the most-watched debate in american history—and the format itself will be part of the reason why. two drastically different personalities will, essentially, have six free-for-all segments to go at each other. the more polarized the electorate, the more valuable this kind of format is—it diminishes the role of moderators and panels, who voters increasingly distrust, and gives the candidates the opportunity to guide the conversation. similar formats have been successful in countries like france and spain—and the u.s., too. during the 1992 democratic primaries, bill clinton and jerry brown appeared on an episode of donahue in which host phil donahue did little more than introduce his guests and let them have at it; the result was a fascinating and unpredictable hour of television. we should be so lucky to have a similar debate on monday night. *** in the elections to come, strange new debate experiments are in the offing. producers of primary debates have experimented with the use of crowd-sourced topics, including questions submitted as youtube videos or via twitter. this past summer, party leaders in australia held one of their national debates not on broadcast and cable tv but on facebook live. technological advances promise to inject new life into what many critics see as a sclerotic institution. at their best, these innovations might hold candidates accountable by tapping into real-time voter reactions and concerns. at worst, an excess of experimentation might reduce presidential debates to high-stakes video games. one novel proposal comes from new america senior fellow lee drutman, who suggests that we ought to end debates as we know them, and replace them with a crisis-situation simulator: “film crews could record the entire simulation, then television producers could turn it into a reality-tv special.” perhaps the candidates can be administered the kobayashi maru; that, too, would receive high ratings. still, without any of that high-tech sizzle, monday night will be must-see tv for any voting-age american. it will simply be two candidates on a stage with one moderator, but likely to be more freewheeling than we’d imagine.      do we really need debate moderators?      
__label__0 the window is rapidly closing for the white house to publicly hit back at russia over a suspected kremlin-backed cyber campaign to meddle in the u.s. election process, according to a vocal cadre of lawmakers who are hammering the obama administration over its silence on the matter. the lack of any open retaliation, they say, is giving russian hackers free rein to manipulate the election process in the final lap of the campaign season, sowing further doubts about an electoral system that gop presidential nominee donald trump frequently bashes as “rigged.” story continued below “i’ve been very surprised the administration hasn’t done something about it,” said sen. dianne feinstein of california, the top democrat on the senate intelligence committee. “i think it’s a very serious problem. this isn’t a small matter. it’s an historic matter. no one has ever been allowed to monkey around with our electoral system.” sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.), a frequent critic of russian president vladimir putin, lamented that the white house is tiptoeing around the hacks “because of this obsession they have with not offending putin because of syria and other things.” “if [russia] did do it,” graham added, “the obama administration won’t do a damn thing about it.” numerous former obama administration officials acknowledge that the longer the white house waits to unveil any response, the more political scrutiny the move will receive, given democrats’ allegations that the kremlin is using its vast hacking apparatus to tilt the election in favor of trump over democratic rival hillary clinton. “it’s harder to do the closer we get to the election,” said timothy edgar, who served in the first obama administration as the director of privacy and civil liberties for the white house national security staff. and some lawmakers and policy experts believe waiting until after election day to strike back publicly means missing a chance to stem the tide of digital assaults on election targets. “you can’t deter after the fact,” said adam segal, an international cyber policy expert at the council on foreign relations. but officials are constrained by competing priorities that could take precedence over shaming moscow for the hacks, which have compromised top democratic political institutions as well as senior government officials on both sides of the aisle. any response could put the final nail in the state department’s already faltering efforts to negotiate a syrian ceasefire agreement with russia, spark a tit-for-tat cyber war between washington and moscow and potentially expose valuable espionage tactics at a time that the u.s. government is reportedly ramping up its digital snooping on putin’s regime. and many on both sides of the aisle, as well as former officials, cautioned that moving swiftly on public finger wagging, economic sanctions or criminal indictments — the three most likely types of official responses — may have little actual deterrent effect before the election. “you know that countries conduct espionage on each other,” senate foreign relations chairman bob corker (r-tenn.) told politico when asked if the white house needed to issue an overt response. “you understand that, right?” house intelligence chairman devin nunes (r-calif.) believes such public responses can establish an impossible mandate to identify hackers after every major breach. “i think that’s the danger in all this,” he said. “if you start to name someone, well, you’re going to have no shortage of people to name, and in a lot of cases it’s not attributable.” the first of this summer’s election-themed cyber intrusions — at the democratic national committee — probably led to july’s mass leak of 20,000 internal emails that appeared to show the party’s favoritism for clinton over her presidential rival sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.). the message dump forced the resignation of dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz. later, hackers released the personal contact information of nearly every democratic house member and staffer after another digital break-in at the democratic congressional campaign committee. elsewhere, suspected russian hackers have also targeted clinton campaign staffers’ personal emails, left-leaning advocacy groups, democratic state officials and potentially even voter registration databases. according to media reports and numerous former officials, the obama administration is probably far along in its investigation into the attacks. u.s. intelligence officials already have “high confidence” that moscow is involved in the spate of hacks, according to anonymous federal officials quoted in the new york times. on thursday, feinstein and house intelligence committee ranking member adam schiff (d-calif.) said they had heard enough in their briefings with officials to conclude that russia is to blame. “we believe that orders for the russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the russian government,” the pair said in a joint statement. the remarks broke with other lawmakers — even those like graham — who have cautioned against accusing russia before authorities make an official determination. “i very much hope the president will respond,” feinstein told politico. “in my mind, there’s no question that the russians have been poking around in our various systems.” lawmakers across the political spectrum have echoed feinstein’s call for a response — regardless of who is responsible. “we need to take action,” senate foreign relations committee ranking member ben cardin (d-md.) told politico. “it’s not just naming, it’s … using the tools we have available to make it clear we won’t accept that type of behavior.” but with little more than six weeks to go before election day, the administration's choices may be limited. preparing criminal indictments for the hackers responsible can take months, even years. the dnc hack was revealed only in june, kicking off the slate of intrusions and leaks that are still ongoing. in the last few weeks alone, suspected russian-linked hackers have posted personal information on democratic donors, revealed internal house race strategy memos from the dccc and leaked the personal emails of former secretary of state colin powell and an apparent white house staffer. “if the process is governed by the criminal investigation, i don’t see that you’re going to have any response by the election,” said michael zweiback, a former chief of the cyber crimes section of the u.s. attorney’s office in california’s central district. conversely, the administration has previously shown it can swiftly prepare economic sanctions following major hacks. it only took five weeks for the white house to announce sanctions on north korea in retaliation for the bruising hack that temporarily disabled sony pictures entertainment in late 2014. whether similar sanctions could have a tangible deterrence effect on russian hacking is debatable, though, even if such a move would help establish international norms in the long run. christopher swift, a former official with the treasury department office that oversees hacking-related sanctions, cautioned that russia’s economy has already had two years to adjust to the strict international penalties slapped on the country in response to its military action in ukraine. additional sanctions may not be “adequate” to alter moscow’s immediate decision-making, he said. russian state-backed hackers often don’t work for the kremlin in an official capacity, making them even more insulated from sanctions, added swift, now a national security professor at georgetown university. many on capitol hill have simply pressured the obama administration to publicly blame russia for the hacks if the investigation finds it culpable. “the deterrence aspect of cyber response is very, very important,” said sen. deb fischer (r-neb.), who chairs a senate armed services subcommittee that oversees cyber threats, during a recent hearing. “public responses make an impression, as well.” but cyber policy experts and former justice department and white house officials concede that any response before the election will have unpredictable ramifications on the presidential campaign trail, just as campaigns are entering the last leg of the race. “no matter what they do, people are going to try and politicize it,” said chris finan, former white house director of cybersecurity legislation and policy. “i don’t know that they can completely insulate themselves.” “both candidates are going to be asked what their position is and what should be done about it,” said ed mcandrew, a former doj national security cyber specialist. “i think that the response, unless it is a strong response, is going to create more potential issues than it’s going to solve, and that [is] certainly so for the candidates.” the white house is also boxed in by the shaky deal the state department tried to reach with russia to reduce violence in syria. state is also working with russia to enforce the wide-ranging, controversial agreement reached with iran last year to reduce its nuclear capabilities. the state department is one of several agencies — including the justice department, defense department and the national security agency — with a key voice at the table advising the white house on its response to the election hacks. given the sensitive situation, some forces within state are probably more hesitant to prod moscow over other issues at the moment, agreed former officials from multiple agencies who have been involved in similar deliberations. the state department has as much ability to “throw up the red flag” as any other agency, said edgar, the former white house cybersecurity official, who is now a visiting fellow with the watson institute of international and public affairs at brown university. most cyber experts and lawmakers — even those who favor a public retaliation — accept that russia would retaliate in-kind for any public move the white house makes. “you never know how they’re going to respond,” cardin said. “one thing is that you can’t take them for their word.” some suspect that a recent online dump of apparent classified nsa hacking tools was meant as a sly message from moscow to washington: we’ll reveal your espionage secrets if you mess with us. “we need to be prepared for the russians’ public response,” said mcandrew, the former doj cyber specialist. “and it might be a tit-for-tat, it might be [russia publicly revealing our operations].” but to those who favor public retaliation, the obama administration can’t let these factors sway them from acting — and acting soon. “i think we still have some time,” said sen. jeanne shaheen (d-n.h.), who has called on the foreign relations committee to hold a hearing on the issue. “if you have an opportunity to forestall further meddling by sending a deterrent signal and making the russians feel some pain … i think the administration has an obligation to do that irrespective of politics,” finan said.      lawmakers losing patience with obama’s silence on russian hacking      
__label__0 the state department has found about 5,600 work-related emails relevant to hillary clinton in a set turned over by the fbi at the end of its investigation into her private server setup, but it appears only about 10 percent of those will be processed for release to the public in advance of the november election. the pace of release ordered by a federal judge friday is far slower than the state department managed last year when it was disclosing as much as 7,000 pages per month from the roughly 54,000 pages of email records clinton provided to her former agency at the end of 2014. story continued below after a hearing in u.s. district court, judge james boasberg issued an order requiring state to process 1,050 pages of the fbi-discovered email records by the election. they are to emerge publicly in three batches, on oct. 7 and 21 and nov. 4. after that, state will continue to produce the emails . at the hearing, boasberg initially said he would order the processing of 1,050 documents in the case by early november, but he later revised his direction to require only that many pages. state initially proposed processing 250 pages every two weeks, or about 750 pages by the election. the conservative watchdog group judicial watch urged the judge to put all 5,600 emails out before the election. "what we are looking for is as much quick turnaround as possible," judicial watch attorney lauren burke said. however, the judge suggested it was "unrealistic" to expect all 5,600 messages to be processed in the next six weeks. the judge acknowledged a public interest in getting the records out before voters go to the polls nov. 8, but he repeatedly expressed sympathy for the challenges state has faced in responding to dozens of freedom of information act lawsuits relating to the emails of clinton and her top aides. he also said he was reluctant to disrupt processing of records in those other cases. “i think we all need to bear in mind the state department has other duties beyond foia requests,” said boasberg, who was appointed by president barack obama. “i know the state department has been working very hard. ... the court can’t jump to the head of the queue.” after the hearing, judicial watch president tom fitton said he disagreed with the judge’s ruling. however, fitton saved his real firepower for the state department, saying the agency is overseeing “an absolutely corrupt process.” “the state department is being obstructionist. they have had these records since july and they’ve only released five records,” fitton said, referring to a smattering of messages released in other cases seeking information on specific topics. “it’s an obvious slow-walking.” a state department spokeswoman declined to comment, but referred to a statement in which spokesman john kirby said state “voluntarily agreed” to turn the messages over to judicial watch even though they were not in state’s possession at the time of the group’s request. he said the records will be posted on state’s website when they’ve been processed. justice department lawyers at friday’s hearing provided more insight into what the fbi turned over to state. attorney lisa olson said the main disk of recovered clinton emails contained 15,171 documents, of which more than 60 percent, or over 9,400, were “deemed purely personal” during a recent “appraisal.” that left about 5,600 considered work-related at least in part, she said, although kirby’s statement said some of those may also be deemed entirely personal after further review. just how much new information will emerge by the election or thereafter remains unclear, for a variety of reasons. many of the 5,600 emails are likely to be duplicates or what state calls “near-duplicates” of the ones clinton already turned over. (state says a “near-duplicate” is an already-processed message with a nonsubstantive notation, like a request to print it out.) olson said at friday’s hearing that the duplicates appear to be a “significant” and “substantial” number of the overall set. another justice lawyer, marcia berman, said she believed a sampling of the 5,600 found “almost half” were duplicates or nearly so. in addition, state could decide to withhold some of the messages in their entirety, in which case they would still count as processed pages even though the public wouldn’t see them. classified emails are being treated separately. olson said a set of those records fbi turned over to state appears to be almost entirely duplicative of material state already processed. state could exceed the judge’s order but seems unlikely to proceed much faster given the litany of statements the agency has made about being under-staffed and overburdened by foia requests and lawsuits relating to emails exchanged by clinton and her close aides. there also the possibility another judge handling a related case could order faster production, but the chance of that also seems remote. during friday’s hearing, berman said the state department no longer has the level of staffing in the foia section that it did when the agency was cranking out thousands of pages a month from the main set of clinton emails. “many of those folks have returned to their regular duties,” berman said. “there’s been a lot of attrition. it’s a very difficult and demanding job these days ... and not a lot of fun.”      judge sets modest pace for release of fbi-found clinton emails      
__label__0 kendall, fla. -- tim kaine isn’t playing the lowered expectations game for hillary clinton ahead of the first presidential debate. the democratic vice presidential nominee all but guaranteed a win by his running mate on monday in new york, predicting clinton will shine and donald trump will fumble when asked about specifics, the trump foundation and trump university. story continued below “when the lights are bright like they are now she brings the a-plus game. she’ll be very, very good tomorrow. donald trump’s a performer and an entertainer, i’m not taking that away from him,” kaine said at a rally here on a campus of miami-dade college. “but he can't get away with the 15-second thing and then walking away. … no, it’s 90 minutes, mano y mano.” kaine’s bullish view of the world came just hours after trump campaign manager kellyanne conway called him the “babe ruth of debating." it’s a counterintuitive political strategy: raising expectations ahead of what may be the most-watched debate in history is a risky proposition for both sides when the race is so tight. in 2012, president barack obama gave a rusty performance in his first debate that jolted the race and alarmed democrats nationwide. the virginia senator himself acknowledged that things had gotten closer than many democrats had hoped, repeatedly calling clinton’s lead “narrow.” but he suggested that monday night could change all that. “you’re going to see him have to get into specifics and hillary too. but we’re going to see who can answer the specific questions. i mean donald trump hasn’t answered a basic question that’s been asked of presidential candidates: show us your tax returns,” kaine said. “donald trump’s had problems with the specifics so far, tomorrow night we’re going to see: can he give some specifics?” kaine barely mentioned mike pence, trump’s running mate, even though the two will debate in just over a week. his only knock on pence was that he was too easy on russian president vladimir putin.      kaine raises debate expectations for clinton      
__label__0 on the eve of the first presidential debate, donald trump’s campaign manager, kellyanne conway, described her candidate sunday as “the babe ruth of debating,” a glowing assessment that’s unusual at a time when both camps typically work to rein in expectations. “he's a brilliant debater,” conway said on abc’s “this week.” “newt gingrich put it best. the former speaker recently said donald trump is the best debater he's ever seen. he's like the babe ruth of debating. he really shows up and swings and does a great job.” story continued below trump has complained that the moderators of the debates may be unfair to him. but conway said she’s not troubled by any of them, including monday night’s moderator, nbc's lester holt. “he's certainly going to be a good debate moderator tomorrow in that i trust that all of these moderators … for all the debates, including the vp debate next week, will be asking questions that benefit the voter,” she said. and conway threw cold water on the notion that gennifer flowers — who claimed a 12-year affair with bill clinton before his presidential bid — would be invited by the campaign to take a front-row seat, a suggestion trump made on twitter in response to the hillary clinton camp’s invitation of mark cuban, a billionaire trump antagonist. (flowers told reporters that she would attend the debate.) “she has not been invited by the campaign. she has a right to be there if somebody else gives her a ticket,” conway said. “but you know, i do think also it shows the poor judgment, a lack of nimbleness of the clinton campaign that they actually put a statement out last night about gennifer flowers being invited, that it shows how easily provoked donald trump is, no, you just put out a statement and reminded people who had no — taught people who had no idea who gennifer flowers is, that she's the woman who had — said she had a 12-year affair with your husband when he was governor.” asked why trump suggested he may invite flowers, conway said, “because he wants to remind people that he's a great counterpuncher.” “they started this one by saying that they would give a front-row seat to mark cuban,” she said. gop vice-presidential nominee mike pence, in an interview on "fox news sunday," also said flowers would not be attending the debate.      conway calls trump 'the babe ruth of debating'      
__label__0 house speaker paul ryan, who tussled with joe biden on the national debate stage in 2012, had one piece of advice as gop presidential nominee donald trump prepares to take the stage for the first time in the general election monday: “overprepare.” democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton is the “consummate pro,” the wisconsin republican said on cbs’ “face the nation.” “this is new for donald, so i think he should probably overprepare for it. … i hope he’s doing this." story continued below but trump doesn’t appear to be doing that. reports suggest he’s done little traditional preparation — from poring over briefing books to participating in mock debates. the new york times reported friday that trump has been studying videos of clinton’s previous debate performances, and politico reported last week that his team has been building a psychological profile of clinton to exploit her tics and tells. ryan in 2012 debated biden as mitt romney's running mate at centre college in kentucky. asked about how trump is getting ready, gop vice-presidential nominee mike pence, also appearing on cbs, said the real estate mogul has been preparing for the debate “his whole life.”      ryan advice to trump on debate: 'overprepare'

__label__0 mike pence defended his running mate donald trump’s call for nationwide stop-and-frisk policies that they claim have been effective in preventing crime despite concerns it could exacerbate ties with minority communities. “it’s on a sound constitutional footing,” pence said on "fox news sunday," after acknowledging that one federal court struck down the practice after statistics revealed it targeted overwhelming numbers of african-american and hispanic residents in new york. story continued below the indiana governor, describing an “avalanche of violence” wracking chicago, said the policy gives police authority to search those “they think may be involved or about to be involved in criminal activity.” pence sidestepped a question about trump’s claim that lax vetting of immigrants somehow contributed to last weekend’s terrorist attacks in minnesota, new york and new jersey. the attackers implicated in those incidents were both admitted to the united states as children. pence didn’t say how tougher vetting would have helped prevent those attacks, but he said: “we need common sense back in our immigration policies.” pence also referenced a turkish immigrant implicated in a friday shooting north of seattle that left five dead as he made his call for changes in immigration policy. “we don’t know the motivation of the permanent legal resident in washington state who took five american lives last night,” he said.      pence: stop-and-frisk is constitutional      
__label__0 gary johnson said a hillary clinton or donald trump presidency would be deeply flawed and shrugged off the notion that he could play spoiler in a tight presidential contest, despite fears among democrats, in particular, that he’s snatching votes from clinton. “the people voting for me are voting for gary johnson,” the libertarian presidential contender said sunday on abc’s “this week,” with george stephanopoulos. “i take great pride in the fact that i am actually offering an alternative. … fifty percent of people that are registering to vote are registering as independents. how is it that we can only have two candidates?” story continued below “i’m going to sleep well at the end of all this, giving people a first vote, not a second vote, not a lesser of two evils.” clinton’s campaign manager, robby mook, who spoke earlier on the same program, shrugged off johnson’s impact on the race. “he’s taking votes from both candidates, but your own poll showed that his numbers are — are dropping,” he said, referring to a new washington post/abc news poll that showed johnson dipping to 5 percent support. “i don’t think that they’re — that either of the third-party candidates are really going to factor into the head-to-head in this race.”      johnson: 'i’m going to sleep well at the end of all this'      
__label__0 the beginning of the presidential candidacy of donald trump included statements that would have ended the campaign of any other politician. has an announcement speech ever looked so much like a flashily produced political suicide? did he really just call a key part of the electorate criminals and rapists? ever since his blunt, racially divisive debut in trump tower in june 2015, trump has proven that gaffes do not singe his hide like they do the fragile and fretful politicians who tiptoe through the typical campaign for public office. time and again, trump poured gasoline on himself and lit a match. time and again, pundits predicted fatal self-immolation. instead, trump often rode the ensuing firestorm like an atlas rocket. his poll numbers actually went up after he insulted john mccain’s war record. what mainstream politician has ever said something like that, much less received a boost out of it? the only thing more stunning than trump’s dismantling of campaign norms has been how consistently he has flirted with disaster. story continued below he has insulted brown people, black people, muslim people, jewish people. he has insulted women. he has insulted the grieving parents of a dead soldier. he has mocked a disabled person and expressed admiration for dictators. he has ham-handedly pandered to a politically critical portion of the population by posting to social media a picture of gringo tex-mex captioning it, “i love hispanics!” he has suggested he could shoot somebody and not lose votes. he has openly talked about the possibility of the assassination of his opponent. twice. and these are just the insults, not the demonstrable falsehoods. it helped him dispatch 16 challengers in the extended primaries of a party of which he has been an off-and-on member, and it has taken him to monday night, to the first of three debates against hillary clinton—his best chance yet to get an edge in the race to become the 45th president of the united states. amid the pre-debate speculation that he could say something at the debate that would cost him the election, it’s difficult to imagine what he could say that would do what so many other statements of his were unable to and end his campaign. here are 37 of his gaffes that could have been fatal—but somehow weren’t. 1. “when mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. they’re not sending you. they’re not sending you. they’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. they’re bringing drugs. they’re bringing crime. they’re rapists. and some, i assume, are good people.” june 16, 2015, announcement speech. 2. “he’s not a war hero. he was a war hero because he was captured. i like people who weren’t captured.” july 17, 2015, family leadership summit in iowa. trump was referring to senator john mccain, a former navy pilot who was tortured during his five-and-a-half years as a pow during the vietnam war. 3. “you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.” august 7, 2015, cnn interview about megyn kelly, one of fox news’ moderators in the first republican debate. 4. “well i really watch the shows. you really see a lot of great, you know, when you watch your show and all of the other shows, and you have the generals and you have certain people that you like.” august 16, 2015, interview on nbc’s “meet the press,” trying to name his foreign policy advisors. 5. “look at that face! would anyone vote for that? can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!” september 9, 2015, in rolling stone, talking about gop candidate carly fiorina. 6. “it has not been easy for me ... my father gave me a small loan of a million dollars.” october 26, 2015, on nbc’s “today” show. 7. “@mygreenhippo #bencarson is now leading in the #polls in #iowa. too much #monsanto in the #corn creates issues in the brain? #trump #gop.” october 22, 2015, retweet by @realdonaldtrump. 8. “i want to know who are the soldiers carrying suitcases with $50 million? how stupid are we? i wouldn’t be surprised if those soldiers, if the cash didn’t get there.” october 1, 2015, speech in keene, new hampshire, suggesting u.s. soldiers embezzled cash intended for disbursement to officials in iraq and afghanistan. 9. “now the poor guy, you ought to see this guy. ‘ah, i don’t know what i said! i don’t remember!’” november 24, 2015, physically mocks new york times reporter serge kovaleski, who has a congenital condition called arthrogryposis that affects his joints. 10. “i think, for me, nuclear is just the power, the devastation is very important to me.” december 15, 2015, answering a debate question about his priority in the “nuclear triad,” the three ways (air, land and sea) that nuclear missiles can be launched. 11. “the other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. they care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. when they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families,” december 2, 2015, interview on “fox & friends.” 12 a. “is there anyone in this room who doesn’t renegotiate deals? probably 99 percent of you. probably more than any room i've ever spoken in.” 12 b. “i’m a negotiator like you folks were negotiators.” 12 c. “you’re not going to support me because i don’t want your money,” december 3, 2015, speaking at the republican jewish coalition. 13. “donald j. trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.” december 7, 2015, reading from a statement by the trump campaign. 14. “two corinthians, right? two corinthians 3:17, that’s the whole ballgame. where the spirit of the lord—right?—is, there is liberty!” february 18, 2016, speech at liberty university, citing the book of the bible that christians call “second corinthians.” 15. “so if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of ’em, would you? seriously. okay? just knock the hell — i promise you, i will pay for the legal fees. i promise. i promise.” february 1, 2016, rally in cedar rapids, iowa. 16. “if and when the vatican is attacked by isis, which as everyone knows is isis’s ultimate trophy, i can promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that donald trump would have been president because this would not have happened. … for a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful. i am proud to be a christian and as president i will not allow christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened, unlike what is happening now, with our current president. no leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man’s religion or faith.” february 18, 2016. press release from the trump campaign. 17. “well, just so you understand, i don't know anything about david duke, okay? i don't know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. so, i don't know.” february 28, 2016 on cnn, asked if he’ll disavow the endorsement of former ku klux klan leader david duke. 18. “lyin' ted cruz just used a picture of melania from a g.q. shoot in his ad. be careful, lyin' ted, or i will spill the beans on your wife!” march 22, 2016, tweet from @realdonaldtrump. 19. “the answer is that there has to be some form of punishment.” march 30, 2016, at an msnbc town hall meeting in green bay, wisconsin, discussing what should happen to women who procure illegal abortions. 20. “it's not like, gee whiz, nobody has them. so, north korea has nukes. japan has a problem with that. i mean, they have a big problem with that. maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from north korea … including with nukes, yes, including with nukes," april 3, 2016, interview with chris wallace on fox. 21. “i was down there, and i watched our police and our firemen, down on 7-eleven, down at the world trade center, right after it came down. and i saw the greatest people i’ve ever seen in action.” april 18, 2016, speech in buffalo, new york, misidentifying the 9/11 attacks. 22. “his father was with lee harvey oswald prior to oswald’s being — you know, shot. i mean, the whole thing is ridiculous. what is this, right prior to his being shot, and nobody even brings it up. they don’t even talk about that. that was reported, and nobody talks about it. i mean, what was he doing — what was he doing with lee harvey oswald shortly before the death? before the shooting? it’s horrible.” may 3, 2016, interview with fox news, repeating unsubstantiated allegations that ted cruz’s father was involved in the assassination of john f. kennedy. 23. “happy #cincodemayo! the best taco bowls are made in trump tower grill. i love hispanics!” may 5, 2016, tweet by @realdonaldtrump. 24. “and rape.” may 19, 2016, fox news interview with sean hannity, in which trump alleges that bill clinton committed rape as well as other sexual offenses. 25. “the judge was appointed by barack obama, federal judge. frankly, he should recuse himself because he’s given us ruling after ruling after ruling, negative, negative, negative. what happens is the judge, who happens to be, we believe, mexican, which is great. i think that’s fine.” may 27, 2016, rally in san diego, in which he criticizes indiana-born judge gonzalo curiel, who, on the basis of his mexican ancestry, trump alleges cannot judge fairly in a lawsuit related to trump university. 26. “look at my african american over here!” june 3, 2016, rally in redding, california. 27. “just arrived in scotland. place is going wild over the vote. they took their country back, just like we will take america back. no games!” june 24, 2016, tweet by @realdonaldtrump from scotland. 28. “he was a bad guy—really bad guy. but you know what?

__label__0 obamaworld laughed as it watched donald trump’s hostile takeover of the gop. after eight years of republican opposition, inconsistent policy demands and racialized hate against the first black president, president barack obama’s aides, past and present, thought republicans had gotten what they deserved--and more, all but forfeiting the 2016 race to the woman they defeated eight years ago. they’re not laughing anymore. story continued below going into monday night’s debate, obama’s team is feeling that same anxiety expressed by some top hillary clinton aides: maybe the country isn’t what they thought, maybe the resistance to obamacare and gay marriage and the progress they’re so proud of is broader than the vocal fringe they’ve always dismissed. maybe, the president’s aides – current and former – now concede, they’re going to have to live with the fact that trump could end up in the oval office in part due to a backlash against obama. “i’m trying to think of a series to compare it to, which was a series that started as a comedy and became a high stakes drama,” said ben labolt, a former white house aide and press secretary for obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. “i feel like we’re maybe in the fifth season of ‘breaking bad’ here. we’re way beyond the laughs, and just sitting on the edge of our seats in terror.” “there's not a lot of mirth in the circles i run in about him,” said another former senior obama campaign staffer. privately, obama has expressed mixed feelings, according to people close to the president. he’s still nursing amusement at republicans for being hapless enough to get railroaded by trump, but it’s mixed with frustration that there are so many americans he failed to reach. people who've spoken to him say the president wonders what he might have done differently to break through in a way that would make people who’ve benefited from his policies—like those enjoying added health benefits courtesy of obamacare—support democrats. for obamaworld staffers who had just been starting to settle into a new buoyancy about the president's climbing approval numbers, trump’s growing strength is an agonizing reminder of how far short they have fallen in delivering on ‘hope.' even if clinton wins, the republican has shown not only that america is divided between red and blue but that there’s an america that obama never connected with at all, and where all his data and rational arguments and appeals to sensibilities are as useless as monopoly money. “we are still the country that elected barack obama in 2008, and we are capable of that and more,” said jim papa, a former special assistant for legislative affairs in the white house. “but we’re also capable of making bad choices and being seduced by someone who plays to fears and anxieties and racial differences.” trump’s already done things they never thought he could, like mainstreaming racist rhetoric and racking up so many small donors that they worry about the extent of his support. and that was even before he riled up obama doubters again with his birther pirouette. and the result: trump’s doing better in the polls at this late stage than obama’s team imagined. with 43 days to go, trump and clinton are essentially tied, polls sitting within the margin of error, even in battleground states. though only a few weeks ago, current and former obama aides would joke about how the president’s great political legacy might be the republican party destroying itself in front of him. now, on the record, they push back on the very suggestion that obama’s legacy should be viewed in any frame that trump also occupies. “i don’t think he thinks it’s his legacy, i don’t think any of us think it’s his legacy,” said dan pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to the president. “trumpism is a lot of things in this country. president obama is the face of that for some republicans, but the republican party got themselves into this mess.” but they worry about what even a trump loss says about obama’s america. “i think he will lose badly in this election, but i think the impact he’s had on our political process is incredibly damaging, and will be lasting,” said tommy vietor, a former national security spokesman who noted that his own amusement at trump ended a year ago. “he’s made us look stupid. i think he is stupid.” for any efforts obama made in urging people to disagree without being disagreeable, as the president likes to say, “trump has shattered that,” vietor said. “he has brought back a brand of politics that is you punch your opponent as hard as you can, it doesn’t matter if it’s a low blow, it doesn’t matter if it’s not of substance. that’s a bad lesson for people to learn.” according to earnest, obama is serious about wanting a functional opposition and wishes that he’d had one to negotiate with on immigration reform, trade, infrastructure and other priorities. the sense of lost opportunity eats at them, as does the sense that it’s not going away, despite their confidence in clinton’s chances. “i’m not saying we’d all be playing acoustic guitar in a circle on the national mall, but i am saying we would have progress to show for our efforts,” said white house press secretary josh earnest, who's been with the president since the first campaign. not everyone’s inside obamaworld is down. some schadenfreude remains. “he's still exposed and ripped apart factions of the gop, enhanced their brand as hostile to a rising electorates, and will leave them with no infrastructure,” said a more upbeat former obama 2008 campaign spokesman hari sevugan. and democrats’ sense of the vacuous gop that trump represents continues to resonate, particularly as they see the republican nominee attack an economy that’s gone wrong with the support of many of the same people who opposed the policies that the president credits for the economic rebound that includes the longest period of sustained growth and taxpayers repaid with interest from the bailouts that caused so much trouble. “the eight-year legacy of the recovery from the great recession is clear evidence that the tea party movement,” said earnest, “is intellectually bankrupt—or about something other than the economy.” but that doesn't take care of their grief about the state of american politics. “i’d rather live in a world where the two parties really compete,” papa said, “than have a political edge on the republican party but have to live in a world where white supremacists have a channel and are legitimized.”      obama’s team isn’t laughing at trump anymore      
__label__0 hillary clinton and donald trump will debate for 90 minutes on monday. but the winner likely will be determined in the first half-hour. that’s when al gore first sighed, mitt romney knocked president barack obama on his heels, and marco rubio, earlier this year, glitched in repeating the same talking point — over and over and over. it’s when gore tried, unsuccessfully, to invade george w. bush’s space, richard nixon was first caught wiping away sweat with a handkerchief (during the moderators’ introductions!) and gerald ford in 1976 made the ill-advised declaration that, “there is no soviet domination of eastern europe.” story continued below veteran presidential debate coaches and campaign strategists say the tone and trajectory of general election debates have long been set in their opening minutes, and that the explosion of real-time spin and twitter groupthink has only accelerated the trend. and so, as clinton and trump square off monday at hofstra university before a national audience that is expected to shatter viewership records, the pressure will be especially intense right at the start. “you have your maximum audience at its most impressionable stage in the first minutes of the debate,” said mari maseng will, a veteran republican debate coach who served as communications director in the reagan white house. campaigns now specially design one-liners for those crucial opening minutes and map out plans to pivot to safer ground if the early questioning veers into rockier political terrain, such as, say, classified emails for clinton or charges of misogyny for trump. in a sign of the warp speed in which debate storylines can form, buzzfeed in 2012 famously posted a story with the headline, "how mitt romney won the first debate," only 42 minutes into the first obama-romney clash in denver. kevin madden, then a senior romney adviser, said the campaign could see the conventional wisdom hardening among the chattering class online in real time. “it was clear romney was going to be declared the winner no matter what happened in the other 60 minutes, barring any big mistakes,” madden said. (romney fell victim to this, too, when he spent the first half of his final encounter largely agreeing with obama and was portrayed as overly “passive.”) debate pros, much like courtroom lawyers, have a name for this: “the primacy effect.” it’s the idea that whatever is heard first is likely to be what is best remembered. “in debates and in trial work, there’s the doctrine of primacy,” said judd gregg, who played gore in bush’s mock debate preparations in 2000 and john kerry in 2004. “if you do a good job — or a really bad job — it will stay with the viewer.” how long, exactly, clinton and trump have to form that first impression is the subject of, well, some debate. todd graham, a presidential debate junkie and director of debate at southern illinois university, where his teams have won five national championships, estimated that candidates have about 45 minutes. “the first half of the debate is absolutely the most important,” graham said. examples are plentiful. reagan’s classic 1984 line, “i am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience,” came just before the halfway point. in 2000, gore began making off-camera sighs and split-screen smirks in the opening minutes of the first general election debate, expressions of exasperation that would come to define his bouts with bush. bush, meanwhile, quickly landed lines about gore’s “phony numbers” and, later, “fuzzy math” that would be endlessly repeated. then, early in their third debate, gore physically approached bush in an act of intimidation that backfired at the town-hall style debate. bush glanced over and gave gore a quick, dismissive nod that drew laughs from the crowd as gore gamely still tried to corner bush on obscure specifics. “what about the dingle-norwood bill?” gore demanded, before eventually retreating to his chair. bush never answered. he didn’t need to. the early minutes proved critical in some of this year’s primary debates, too. in february, chris christie’s campaign-crushing retort to rubio’s repeating of a talking point — “there it is. the memorized 25-second speech. there it is, everybody” — came fewer than 20 minutes into the two-hour debate. rubio never recovered that night, or the rest of the campaign. curt anderson, chief strategist for bobby jindal, who appeared in the so-called undercard debates, said the bias toward the beginning was striking. “there’s this whole twitterverse dynamic where it’s decided in the opening minutes. it’s not rational or fair, and you can bitch all you want about it, but you have to adjust and deal with it,” he said. by the end, jindal’s team designed its debate strategy around landing its weightiest punches early. in the most extreme of cases, an entire debate’s storyline can be sealed after a single question. in 1988, the very first question asked of michael dukakis was whether he would support the death penalty if his wife were “raped and murdered.” without any visible emotion, he said he would not. (“when he answered by talking policy, i knew we had lost the election,” dukakis’ campaign manager would later say.) in the 2012 primaries, cnn opened a debate by asking newt gingrich about allegations that he had once wanted an open marriage. “i think the destructive, vicious, negative nature of much of the news media makes it harder to govern this country, harder to attract decent people to run for public office. and i am appalled that you would begin a presidential debate on a topic like that,” gingrich bellowed to thunderous applause. two days later, gingrich, who had been left for dead politically after losing iowa and new hampshire, won the south carolina primary. there are other practical reasons why early minutes matter most: voters can change the channel, and reporters have to start crafting their stories. “reporters are lazy, and they have deadlines, and those two things combined — they don’t have all night,” said graham, who said he watches and reads post-game punditry and “95 percent of people are talking about what happened in the first 45 minutes.” in 2012, rentrak, which tracks television viewership, found that the average home watched only two-thirds of the first debate, though there was no precipitous drop-off over time. but by the third debate, the company reported “the audience just didn’t stay tuned in as long.” there have been key moments late in presidential debates, or course. reagan’s “there you go again” quip to jimmy carter in 1980 came late. george h.w. bush glanced down at his watch when, deep into a 1992 debate, a voter was asking him a question. and lloyd bentsen’s infamous slapdown of dan quayle — “i knew jack kennedy, jack kennedy was a friend of mine. senator, you are no jack kennedy” — came in the waning minutes of the 1988 vice-presidential debate. with trump’s general unpredictability and his reported disdain for full 90-minute dress rehearsals at a lectern, he certainly could tire, slump or lash out late. notably, trump never debated one-on-one in the primary, and all those contests included commercial and bathroom breaks that are absent from the formal fall debates. meanwhile, clinton, in a 2007 primary debate, suffered a late blow after she took two different positions on drivers’ licenses for illegal immigrants in the closing minutes. “i can't tell whether she was for it or against it,” obama pounced. but historically, it has been the first third to half of debates that prove decisive. “attention spans wane,” said brett o’donnell, a republican debate coach who has worked with past presidential candidates, including romney, george w. bush and john mccain. “they’re really set in the first 30 minutes, and you never get a second chance at a first impression.”      clinton vs. trump: the only 30 minutes that matter      
__label__0 the pressure is on hillary clinton. insiders in both parties agree: clinton, having lost most of her lead over the past few weeks and bringing more experience to the stage, faces higher expectations than donald trump when the two square off for the first debate on long island. story continued below that’s according to the politico caucus — a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states. roughly equal percentages of democrats (69 percent) and republicans (74 percent) said clinton is under more pressure to perform than trump. but democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for trump, a relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issues. “she shouldn't be [under more pressure], but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself, the press will give trump a glowing review,” said a nevada democrat — who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. “hillary will need a strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and trump fails the commander-in-chief test.” “the media and trump himself have set the bar too low for trump,” a new hampshire democrat added. “presidents don't get graded on a curve, and candidates in debates shouldn't be either.” one ohio democrat detected a double standard for the first female major-party nominee. “hillary clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard, and this debate will be no exception,” said the ohio democrat. “she will have to answer every single question flawlessly, exude gravitas, look presidential, channel bill's and barack's oratorical mastery, not raise her voice, not cough, wear an acceptable pantsuit, smile enough, be likable, not laugh and have a good hair day. donald trump will just have to show up.” republicans also said clinton was under greater scrutiny on monday night, but for different reasons: tightening polls that show trump eclipsing clinton in some battleground states. “somehow she needs to reverse the trend,” said an ohio republican. “never seen anyone do it before. this will be her chance — and maybe her last chance.” “she has to stop [trump’s] momentum with a strong debate performance, and she has to be able to stand on the stage for 90 minutes and look healthy for 90 minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with a vengeance,” added a virginia republican. “all [trump] has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be president.” among those insiders who said trump was under more pressure — 31 percent of democrats and 26 percent of republicans — most pointed to the gop nominee’s volatile personality. “hillary clinton is expected to do well. she is a policy wonk,” said a michigan republican. “the pressure is on donald trump not to lose his cool. he has been doing very well in his public appearances, but that is with the assistance of a teleprompter. he will have no such help at the debate, and if i were coaching hillary clinton, i would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible. to win the debate, all trump really needs to do is meet expectations, keep his cool, and look presidential.” “the question we are all waiting to have answered is: can he be serious?” added a michigan democrat. “can he answer questions directly? how will he react (or overreact) when he is directly challenged? can he control his temper?” two other takeaways from the pre-debate survey: most insiders expect clinton to “win” the debate. majorities in both parties peg clinton as most likely to be the victor on monday night: 76 percent of democrats and 59 percent of republicans. “media look at who best answered questions, and that will likely be hillary,” said an iowa republican. “[clinton’s] mastery of issues and policies and no-nonsense delivery will prevail over bluster, name-calling and promises that can never be kept,” added a new hampshire democrat. but not all democrats were so optimistic about clinton — or the media through which voters will interpret the debate. “the press wants trump to win,” said a florida democrat. “their disdain for her, plus desire to keep the race alive, means unless he really screws up, they'll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve ever.” some republicans also claimed media bias — in the other direction. “the media has never been more in the tank for a candidate in modern history: cnn, nbc, abc and politico will all say she won,” a virginia republican said. “but then again everyone also 'knew' that carter beat reagan in their debate as well.” insiders think the debate will matter. asked whether they expect the debate to have a significant impact on the race, most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidates. among democratic insiders, 66 percent believe clinton will benefit from the debate, 11 percent think trump will get a bounce and 23 percent don’t expect the debate to move the needle. “trump will flounder, ramble and lie (because he always does),” a michigan democrat predicted. “the moderators will challenge him, and he'll get mad. he'll complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored hillary. first impressions are hard to shake off, and this won't go well for him.” the numbers were flipped for republicans, with slightly less enthusiasm for the gop standard-bearer: 52 percent think the debate will help trump, 26 percent think it will help clinton and 22 percent said it wouldn’t have a significant impact. “trump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and even-tempered,” said a new hampshire republican. “he does that successfully, and he cuts into hillary's greatest strength.” but some republicans said clinton could stunt trump’s momentum with a strong performance monday night. “if she pins his ears back, [it helps her],” said an iowa republican. “if it's a draw, it's a net negative for her. she has to have something to stop his momentum. she's got to hit him with a brick.” other insiders, however, doubted whether the debate would have a significant, permanent effect on the race. “we're past the era of the big debate swings: the bloodless dukakis death penalty answer, the reagan age quip, the bentsen 'you're no john kennedy' moments,” an iowa republican said. “swing voters are like the california condor, a critically endangered species disappearing at an alarming rate. opinion media, partisan polarization, and two highly unpopular candidates make this a battle over a very small group of voters in about a dozen states, and whatever bounce comes out of this debate will dissipate as quickly as it appears.” added a florida democrat: “does a damn thing matter this year? i think not.” these are

__label__0 h.l. mencken declared there was only one way to look at a politician — “down.” likewise, there’s really only one way to look at the first presidential debate on monday: as the first serious job interview for potential president donald john trump — an opaque candidate who has hidden behind a steel curtain of one-liners, faux familiarity and universal celebrity. story continued below yeah, yeah, yeah, it’s a big night for hillary clinton too. she’s got a lot to prove, for real, namely that she’s not the lying, self-dealing crook many americans think she is — or at least convince the 55 percent of voters who don’t like her that her virtues (temperament and experience) compensate for decades of assorted ick. she needs to prove she can stand up to trump, answer the usual email/foundation questions, convince whoever’s still sellable on the idea (stop instagramming a picture of your lunch, millennials, and listen up) that she’s not some scheming granny who will just sell everybody out the second john roberts drops the swearing-in bible. but the spotlight belongs on trump, who is in need of a rigorous job interview. clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency. she’s been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and trump was engaged to marla maples. everyone makes the orange jokes, but trump is something of a black box — running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring american prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness). he’s bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a d student who doesn’t read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesn’t read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, can’t even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing. these are not nasty, biased, liberal opinions. they are facts based on reporting and trump’s own public performances. here are five questions trump needs to address on monday — but taken together, they add up to one big one: is donald trump qualified to be president of the united states? 1. does he actually know — or care to know — the basic information needed to competently run the country? only one verdict of presidential fitness counts, of course, and that’s a candidate’s capacity to get to 270 electoral votes. in recent days, trump — who swooned after clinton’s superb convention in philly — has closed to within the margin of error in many (though not all) national polls, and jumped to serious leads in battlegrounds like ohio and iowa since aug. 1. he’s still the most unpopular candidate in recent history (although clinton is number two with a bullet) and seems to have a ceiling of between 40 and 44 percent nationally. but he can win. fivethirtyeight.com, the arch-aggregator, gives trump nearly a 50 percent chance of prevailing. his resurgence proves three political points — two of them we knew, the third is a surprise to everyone except trump and his team: the country (especially the white working-class parts) is pissed, clinton is a perennially lousy candidate and — lastly, but not leastly — trump has proven to be a resilient and flexible candidate with the capacity (developed late in the game) to shift shape and shut up when he needs to. the first debate should be a pivot — from politicking to president-ing. being a cunning candidate isn’t remotely the same thing as being ready to rule — and we should be moving to the doris kearns goodwin phase of the campaign, where the top priority is fitness to govern in a time of trial. it probably won’t happen, but a boy can dream. this is not to suggest that trump can’t do the job (ronald reagan, another entertainer who forayed into politics, was mostly a success), but he’s been judged as a performer up to this point, and not subjected to the cold fluorescent scrutiny of managerial competence. trump has repeatedly flubbed tests of his basic understanding of domestic and foreign affairs — apparently he wasn’t aware russia had annexed crimea until george stephanopoulos informed him recently. he obliterated jeb bush, that humbled patsy of the gop establishment, in the debates — but bush (if anyone had cared to listen) punctured trump’s bully-boy promise to impose tariffs on chinese products, correctly pointing out that such a move would certainly spark countermeasures by beijing that could lead to a global depression. trump wasn’t aware of that fact, or just didn’t care. the caring part is kind of important, if history is any guide. in april, i sat down with one of his longtime advisers, roger stone, who described what it was like to brief an executive whose prime attributes were supreme self-confidence and supreme impatience. “all you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not,” said stone, who has known the gop nominee for decades. “when you write something for him, keep it short and staccato. he's not going to read a 40-page white paper on the economy; zero chance of that. it's just too boring. don't blame him; i don't like it either. so keep it simple and direct because that's the way he communicates.” stone argued that trump isn’t an ignoramus — just a cut-to-the-chase decision-maker who is a lightning-quick study. but george w. bush’s advisers, speaking to biographer peter baker, said that bush’s unwillingness to ask probing, informed questions led to some of his disastrous decisions in iraq. and during the nadir of the 2009 global economic meltdown, president obama added a daily economic briefing to his daily national security rundown to keep tabs on the rapidly shifting metrics of crisis. trump’s capacity to intuitively assimilate information might render such processes useless — but there’s not a single presidential historian drawing oxygen who believes a lack of intellectual curiosity is an asset for the job. many americans might not give a damn that he knows what hud’s section 8 program is — and his failure to answer informational questions that clinton would parry with ease will endear him to his screw-the-media base. but don’t people have the right to know what he actually knows? trump has gleefully trashed the rules of presidential campaigns, so why should a moderator treat him with the deference of someone who abides by the norms — by assuming he possesses the basic knowledge traditionally required of a presidential candidate? 2. does trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of american constitutional government? again, this is not a given. hillary clinton despises the press, and dodges them as if they were a pack of feral rats, but she has never suggested they be stopped from doing their jobs through the courts. trump (who banned news outlets, including this one, from his events for most of the campaign) routinely threatens litigation against publications that publish unflattering articles and, in february, went so far as to say: “we're going to open up those libel laws. so when the new york times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace … we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected.” that’s a new one for a presidential nominee. as corey brettschneider wrote in politico magazine last month: “for more than 50 years, the supreme court has held that for a public figure to prove libel against a news outlet, they must show that the outlet acted with ‘actual malice’ — that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.” during a private meeting with hill republicans earlier this year, the populist real estate developer expressed his fondness for “article 12 of the constitution.” the framers stopped at seven. “he was just listing out numbers,” said congressman blake farenthold (r-texas), a trump backer at the time. “i think he was confusing articles and amendments.” ok, let’s write that one off as a gotcha — you can understand constitutional principles without citing literal chapter and verse. but consider his reaction to the paris bombings last november when trump told fox news he thought the government should shutter some mosques where “some bad things are happening.” the comment was decried by constitutional scholars of all stripes as a radical measure that would violate the “free exercise” clause of the first amendment, a pillar of protection for faiths of all kinds. 3. why won’t trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts? hillary clinton has, appropriately, has come under intense scrutiny for her six-figure speeches to big wall street firms like goldman sachs — and has refused to release the transcripts of her prattles to the plutocrats. and serious questions remain about the lack of boundaries between the clinton foundation, the state department, and big-money foreign donors who blurred the line between influence peddling and altruism. but the clintons have released all of their tax returns (in part because, for many years, they were required to do so as government employees) and trump is the first major presidential candidate in the modern era to thumb his nose at handing over a single one. why does it matter? because a guy whose purchase on the presidency is rooted in his private-sector acumen needs to back up his claims with proof, in the same way that clinton needs to be held accountable for her purported record of accomplishment in the white house, senate and state department. at issue is trump’s fundamental personal narrative, and his claim that he’s “very, very rich.” he is, but maybe not quite as much as he claims (he says he’s good for $11 billion; forbes and other outlets say he’s worth less than half that much). more serious is the issue of trump’s debts: the clinton campaign, citing press reports that he owes large sums to overseas creditors in china and elsewhere, has attacked him for being in the pocket of foreign financial overlords. if that’s a lie, there’s an easy way to prove it — by releasing the returns. this isn’t a liberal media witch-hunt: many republicans, including supporters like house speaker paul ryan, say he needs to cough them up, and fast. 4. what’s the deal with his charitable foundation? then there’s the matter of trump’s sloppily run, and less-than-magnanimous foundation. in exposé after exposé, washington post reporter david fahrenthold has reported on a pattern of over-promising donations and the misuse of funds (including a quarter-million payment to cover legal fees for trump’s businesses and sports memorabilia) that trump himself has conceded might be illegal. the problem, yet again, is that trump has refused to release a comprehensive accounting of his giving, and his surrogates have routinely misstated the magnitude of his generosity, according to the reporting of fahrenthold and others. 5. why lie? these days, the polygraph is used sparingly as part of the vetting process for employment, mostly for sensitive national security or law enforcement jobs. if presidential candidates were subjected to that level of scrutiny, the only person allowed on the debate stage at hofstra would be the technician testing the sound system. but if trump is to be vetted for the presidency, he needs to be asked not only about individual statements he’s made in the past, but his pattern of lying, stretching the truth and bungling facts. hillary clinton (“crooked hillary” in trump’s parlance) it bears repeating, is no saint — far from it — and her early answers on the email scandal were misleading, bordering on the untruthful, and flat-out lies in the view of gop congressional investigators. but it’s a crowning irony of 2016 that the republican party, whose base revolted against its leadership for untruthfulness — especially george w. bush’s claims about iraq — would nominate the most brazenly truth-challenged candidate in recent history. (a recitation of trump’s whoppers would take up too much space – read politico’s comprehensive “donald trump’s week of misrepresentations, exaggerations and half-truths” for a taste.) in an attempt to defend trump, buddy newt gingrich, who lobbied to be trump’s running mate, tweeted what amounted to an indirect admission that his man has a trouble with all those pesky facts. “clinton,” the former speaker wrote, “is a fox who knows many things you can fact check. trump is a hedgehog who knows one big thing…” but getting the facts right — and telling the truth — is a big thing. it’s the only way citizens will ever look up to, and not down on, their leaders.      is donald trump qualified to be president?      
__label__0 there is a moment at every donald trump rally when donald trump marvels at the crazy spectacle he’s created. “is there any place in america as fun as a donald trump rally?” he asks with a mischievous pursed-lip grin. the moment always comes after a protester tries to interrupt him, only to be drowned out by an arena full of rowdy white people screaming “trump! trump! trump!” that’s the fun part, the joint release of pent-up fury by thousands of proudly politically incorrect americans. when you experience it in person, you can feel their catharsis as they vent at the whiners and moochers and mexicans and muslims taking over their country, gleefully defying the scolds who call them racist and rude for respecting the police and saying merry christmas. “donald trump has singlehandedly untied our tongues,” a chain-saw artist named chris cox, the founder of bikers 4 trump, told me at a recent pensacola rally. story continued below when trump fans are asked about his appeal, the first thing they usually say is that he isn’t a normal politician. and his rambling, fear-mongering, name-calling public speeches, no matter how hard his new handlers try to keep him on his new teleprompter, do not feel like normal political events. they feel like wrestlemania with a different kind of hero and a different kind of performance art. they feel like revival meetings for the donald j. trump church of cultural resentment, with ritual denunciations of crooked hillary clinton, barack obama—“we call him president obama, because we have to treat him with respect, right?”—and other enemies of the congregation. at a time when americans say they’re tired of politics as usual, trump offers politics as deeply, often disturbingly, always unapologetically, unusual. his opponent does not. clinton’s events feel exactly like normal political events. she may be the world’s most famous and polarizing woman, but she’s running an almost generic democratic campaign, politics as very usual. tonight, hillary clinton will take on donald trump in perhaps the most anticipated presidential debate ever, a rhetorical clash of two candidates with diametrically opposed life histories, policy agendas, and bases of support. but their contrasting records and ideas haven’t been the defining divides of this strange political year. what 2016 is really about is conventional versus not. and no matter what happens tonight, when you spend time at their diametrically opposed events, you’re constantly reminded that what makes this year so abnormal is trump. he is violating all the rules of the political game—rules that promote pandering and artifice as well as rules that promote transparency and decency—and when 2016 is over, it’s not clear whether those rules will still apply. whatever you think of clinton, she tends to observe polite-society political traditions, which is why her events would feel familiar to anyone who’s attended a modern campaign stop. the backdrops are decorated with red-white-and-blue bunting and talking-point slogans like “love trumps hate” or “stronger together.” the small venues are selected to target niche groups—millennials last week at temple university in philadelphia, the disabled a few days later at a family outreach center in orlando—and the crowds are carefully curated to avoid protests or other surprises. the speeches are standard campaign fare, dotted with wonky statistics and real-person anecdotes to buttress well-researched policy proposals. the candidate, as she has for nearly four decades in public life, sticks to her prepared text. her audiences are supportive, though not particularly emotive. “i thought it was very substantial, very specific,” glenn mccoy, an adult educator at a catholic church who wore a “hil yes!” pin to clinton’s speech about supporting disabled workers in orlando. “the purpose wasn’t to whip the crowd into a frenzy. we’re not looking to choose a president based on emotion.” clinton had better hope not. there’s electricity at trump rallies that hers can’t match. it’s no coincidence that cable news often ignores her speeches to carry the trump shows live. his crowds wait with giddy anticipation for him to name and shame enemies, like nascar fans waiting for wrecks, and they explode when he calls out the dishonest media, the job-stealing chinese, the pc sensitivity snobs who think you’re prejudiced if you want to keep illegal immigrants and islamic terrorists out of the country. it’s entertaining to watch him violate norms, declaring clinton lacks the stamina to be president, suggesting her security detail ought to disarm, warning the election will probably be rigged. he flings out absurd claims about the skewing of the unemployment rate, the savagery of inner cities, even the temperature at his rallies. (“it’s 100 degrees in here. and that’s considered cool for an auditorium.”) he casually drops one outlandish bombshell—the federal reserve is corrupt, the fbi is covering up for clinton, nafta was the worst deal in the history of the world—then moves onto another before the last fully explodes. clinton doesn’t do that. whatever one thinks about her email protocols or benghazi or her penchant for secrecy, she campaigns like a typical candidate. she has the strengths and weaknesses of a typical public servant, and takes typical measures to try to frame them for the public. her problem is that trump’s unique combination of insult comedy and monster-truck rally, despite the flagrant abuse of facts and unsettling whiff of menace, is exposing the focus-grouped, stage-managed, paint-by-numbers nature of typical candidacies. clinton isn’t getting a lot of credit for following the rules of a game that always seemed inauthentic. nobody understands that better than the political savant named donald j. trump. he tells a lot of straight-faced falsehoods about clinton’s campaign, like his accusations that it’s “policy-free,” when he used to mock it for churning otut too many policy proposals, and when trump himself recently laid off much of his policy shop. but there’s something to his caricature of clinton events as the lackluster politics of yesteryear. at a rally in miami, he did a sly imitation of clinton's speeches—he claimed with faux specificity that they're only 18 minutes, when they're usually twice that long—with a bored expression that suggested she just phones them in. “bom. bom. bom. see ya!” trump smirked. “see ya! i’m going home.” many americans really do seem sick of bom-bom-bom-see-ya politics. but the live experience of trump’s say-anything middle-finger alternative can be a bracing advertisement for the mundane traditions he’s shredding every day. *** before attending a recent trump rally in pensacola, i watched a video of his last rally there during the republican primary in january. at the time, the news from the event had been his i’m-just-saying speculation that questions about ted cruz’s citizenship might be disqualifying. but starting with the star spangled banner, performed by a kids group that later sued trump for breach of contract, the entire rally seemed like a trip through the looking glass to an alternative political planet. trump spent the first 10 minutes of his hourlong soliloquy bashing the “bad, dishonest, very bad people” in the media for failing to show the public the size of his crowds, a theme he revisited three more times. he criticized a u.s. soldier for using the word “sir” to address the iranians who briefly captured him. he advised americans to take their money out of the stock market, which he described as “a big fat bubble,” and predicted a collapse that would be “beautiful to watch.” he gleefully pointed out a black man in the stands: “i didn’t put him there! i’m not paying him!” he read a long poem about a deadly snake that was supposed to show the danger of syrian refugees, called himself “more militaristic than anyone in this room,” complained that common core education bureaucrats make $400,000 a year—actually the president’s salary—and announced the american dream was dead. oh, he also unleashed a diatribe about incompetent contractors and staff after his microphone crackled. “whoever the hell brought this mic system—don’t pay the son of a bitch!” he seethed. “don’t pay em. don’t pay em. you know, i believe in paying, but when somebody does a bad job, like this stupid mic, you shouldn’t pay the bastard. terrible. you gotta be tough with your people, because they’ll pay, they don’t care. so we’re not going to pay. i guarantee, i’m not paying for this mic.” so i was ready for more theater of the bizarre when trump returned eight months later to pensacola’s 12,000-seat arena, which was once again packed to capacity. vendors sold trump that bitch t-shirts and trump 2016 confederate flags. the pastor giving the invocation shouted: “tyranny has raised its ugly head! our constitution is under attack!” the crowd started chanting “lock her up!” before trump even appeared. he then took the stage to a tremendous roar, and…well, to be honest, he seemed a lot less provocative than i had expected. “he’s freeing up our speech,” said one trump supporter. “we can talk about the muslim invasion. we can be against amnesty… maybe we’ll be able to say merry christmas again.” trump was now using a teleprompter, which he had derided as a tool of inauthenticity in january, and while he used it more as a guideline than a script, it was still jarring to hear him regurgitate staff-written clichés and republican talking points about “encrusted insiders” and “turning the page.” he said the kind of things regular politicians say: “the history books are closing on the failed politicians of yesterday.” and: “once again, we’ll have a government of, by, and for the people.” he even recited the monotonous details of a military investment plan a conservative think tank had prepared for him, name-checking new naval vessels in a town with a naval base. the crowd was noisier and angrier than a normal political crowd—during one trump riff about lifting minorities out of poverty, a supporter in a red-white-and-blue trucker hat screamed: “what about white people?”—but the rally still felt at least quasi-normal. trump did repeat a few of his radical proposals that remain astounding when you think about them, like a 35 percent tax on imports and his mexico-financed wall—but really, who still thinks about them? afterwards, though, i saw a breaking story about an offhand comment trump had made warning that if iranian sailors ever made rude gestures at americans when he was president, as they apparently had during a minor incident a few weeks earlier, their ships would be blown out of the water. trump had essentially threatened to launch world war 3, and i hadn’t noticed. back at my hotel, i checked my notes and was reminded that he had also literally accused clinton of causing “all the problems in the world,” including north korean nuclear tests that began under george w. bush. he had mused that “personally, i think she’s an unstable person,” and complained that she could walk into the arena and shoot someone “right smack in the middle of the heart—and she wouldn’t be prosecuted, ok?” he had denied cozying up to russian dictator vladimir putin—and then he had cozied up again: “he’s been nice to me, and if he’s nice to me, that’s fine. if we got along with russia, that wouldn’t be so bad, would it?” and at a time of low unemployment, cheap gas, and new data showing that wages grew and poverty shrunk in 2015 at the fastest rate in decades, trump had flatly declared that “the country is collapsing.” those all would have been jaw-dropping statements during any other campaign from any other candidate, but the year of trump has desensitized many of us to his rapid-fire transgressions. we’re normalizing the unprecedented. at a rally a few days later in asheville, n.c., trump called the u.s. military “incredibly weak,” defended a male spectator who roughed up a 68-year-old female protester, and said the black community—which endured slavery and jim crow—was “in the worst shape they’ve ever been. ever! ever! ever!” yet the main trump story from the associated press focused on how he had refrained from attacking clinton over her bout with pneumonia, under the headline “restraint on clinton health shows new campaign discipline.” predictably, trump mocked clinton’s health problems later in the week, suggesting she needed more sleep, warning she didn’t have enough energy to handle the rigors of the white house, falsely claiming he was holding four rallies a day and then just as falsely claiming she couldn’t make it through one. that sort of behavior just hasn’t been seen on the presidential campaign trail. but it’s that defiant you-can’t-tell-me-what-i’m-supposed-to-say spirit that trump loyalists love. “he’s not a politician. nobody controls him. a lot of us are tired of worrying about people’s feelings, always watching our p’s and q’s, so it’s cool to see him speak his mind,” said alan smith, a 43-year-old firefighter from nearby gulf breeze who recently retired on his municipal pension. bill turpin, a retired army veteran from brayton, iowa, told me at a trump rally outside des moines that while clinton is a classic politician for whom lying is like breathing—he doesn’t even believe the official story about her health, because he fainted once, and he didn’t stumble around like she did on the video—trump is a businessman with nothing to fear: “he’ll call a spade a spade, and if you don’t like it you can shove it.” again and again, trump supporters told me they appreciated the way he was fighting the forces of political correctness, standing up for their right to primal-scream what they believe about immigrants and terrorists and black lives matter thugs. “he’s freeing up our speech,” said norris westfall, an auto detailer who wore an infowars liberty or death t-shirt to a recent trump rally in asheville, n.c. “we can talk about the muslim invasion. we can be against amnesty without everyone saying we’re offensive. maybe we’ll be able to say merry christmas again.” it’s fashionable to attribute the trump phenomenon to economic anxiety, but the trump voters i interviewed at four separate rallies almost never mentioned it, unless complaints that the undocumented are getting jobs and welfare benefits counts as economic anxiety. they seemed less anxious about the state of the obama economy than the rise of the multicultural obama coalition, and they seemed less anxious than pissed off—at a president many of them still consider a foreign usurper, at thought leaders more worried about islamophobia than islamic terror, at racial guilt-trippers who demonize cops while ignoring black-on-black crime. in asheville, i watched an air force veteran named gary latham explode at some anti-trump protesters who were chanting that they didn’t want hate in their state: “lazy motherfuckers! get a fucking job!” he explained to me that america was under siege, with “thousands of syrian refugees embedded in western carolina,” and that he was proud to be one of the vigilant americans clinton considered “deplorable.” the trump voters i interviewed seemed less anxious about the obama economy than the rise of the multicultural obama coalition—and they seemed less anxious than pissed off. one of the speakers before trump took the stage in asheville was a white-haired lady who owns a custom frame shop and serves in the state legislature. she used the opportunity to proclaim: “we want our state rights back!” “we’re sick of the same old racism crap getting shoveled down our throats,” says kim buckner, a nursing assistant who wore a don’t tread on me pin to the asheville rally. “trump is saying what we’re all thinking: ‘screw you! call us deplorable all you want! our rights don’t end where your feelings begin!’” trump echoes those anti-anti-racism tropes, describing accusations of racism as “the oldest play in the democratic playbook.” and he’s begun regaling his white audiences with increasingly lurid descriptions of inner-city life, arguing that it’s so hellish blacks might as well vote trump: “i’ll say it openly, and some people don’t like it, i don’t really care: what do you have to lose?” his long riffs about how he’ll fix neighborhoods so awful that blacks can’t walk down the street without getting shot have been described as outreach to non-racist whites, but in person, they feel much more like creepy concern-trolling for the benefit of jeering trump fans who want to believe that blacks live like animals. when trump claims that black youths don’t get an education and have an unemployment rate of 58 percent—the real rate is about one third of that—he’s fueling the kind of ugly stereotypes found all over the white-supremacy sites he retweets every now and then. the trump supporters i interviewed seemed much less interested in supporting inner-city blacks than criticizing their lifestyles, bemoaning their dependence on government, and blaming their president. polls show that most trump supporters still think obama was born in kenya—and many i spoke to believe he’s also a muslim who supports isis. one notable exception was richard cohen, a jewish contractor who attended the rally in asheville. cohen told me trump is pandering to racism, anti-semitism, and fear of hispanics among his supporters; he said a white friend with two adopted black sons left an earlier trump event after hearing spectators yell the n-word. but cohen supports trump anyway, because he likes the idea of shaking up the timid, finger-in-the-wind political establishment. “a lot of us who like him don’t like the stuff he says about race,” cohen said. “obviously, some do.” this really isn’t normal. and while clinton is an unlikely poster child for normal—a first lady whose husband was impeached after cheating on her with an intern, a secretary of state who agreed to serve the younger man who foiled her own presidential dreams—she presents herself on the trail as a dedicated but ordinary public servant who happens to be the alternative to a bigoted freak. i remember watching her execute a similar strategy in 2000 when she ran for a senate seat in new york even though she had never lived in the state or pursued public office, even though her husband was still in the white house after his tabloid scandal had transfixed the nation. she simply ignored the weirdness of it all, running as a standard-issue democrat in a democratic state, diligently discussing dairy policy and upstate development as if nothing else mattered. and against a basically normal republican candidate, it worked. a majority of new yorkers agreed with her agenda, and sent her to the senate to pursue it. in 2016, though, clinton has struggled to make a case for normal. she’s tried to push a standard-issue democratic agenda, but in the year of trump, the race hasn’t been about standard anything. *** nearly one of every five americans lives with a disability, and just about everyone else wishes them the best. so clinton’s orlando speech about valuing their work made sense politically as well as morally, as an expression of her commitment to helping the vulnerable and creating an “inclusive economy,” to quote the clunky slogan behind her podium. in the i-4 corridor that constitutes the swingiest region of the swingiest state, clinton spoke to 300 supporters—a much smaller crowd than trump regularly attracts, but far more diverse—about her goal of an america that recognizes the humanity and supports the potential of all its citizens. she also laid out a four-part plan her policy team had devised to help more disabled americans flourish in the economy. just two months before election day, the speech was designed to illustrate clinton’s concern about a worthy issue. it did that, more or less. afterwards, her supporters praised her seriousness of purpose, her depth of knowledge, her willingness to listen. nobody mentioned eloquence or flair, but her people understand that she never hosted a reality show. “i thought it was a nice speech,” lewis smith, a retired mechanic in orlando, told me afterwards. “not very exciting, but i believe she’ll do what she says.” the speech started slowly, as clinton spent nearly the first half on shoutouts to key supporters, a few made-for-tv soundbites about the riots in charlotte, and an abridged version of her broader stump speech about an economy that works for everyone. her speechwriters clearly cut-and-pasted in some of her standard lines about her middle-class origins, her support for family-friendly policies like paid leave, and a plug for her new book of campaign proposals about everything from alzheimer’s disease to campus sexual assault to small business incubators. the rest of the speech was dedicated to the proposition that clinton is committed to promoting the talents and dreams of disabled americans who have been undervalued by society for too long. it was a nice sentiment, expressed through the kind of political saccharine that sends viewers scurrying for the remote control: “across the country, people with disabilities are running businesses, teaching students, caring for our loved ones. they’re holding public office, making breakthrough scientific discoveries, reporting the news, and creating art that inspires and challenges us.” maybe some disabled americans create uninspiring art, but not in hillary clinton speeches. “in the united states of america, the greatest country in the world, we believe that everyone is created equal,” clinton said. this kind of boilerplate scores a lot higher in truth value than in news value. clinton did talk about her own work with the disabled, from her push for their right to attend school as a young children’s defense fund lawyer to her appointment of the state department’s first-ever advisor for disability rights. she mentioned disabled people she’s known—including the “unbelievably good-looking” actor christopher reeve, who told her that “family values” should mean that every family has value—and her discussions with advocates who said they want paychecks rather than pity. she then detailed her plan, which, while infinitely more substantive than anything trump has ever said about disabilities, was mostly placeholders about partnering with schools and businesses, plus an elimination of the “sub-minimum wage” that is currently paid to some disabled workers. the audience responded with warmth, if not exuberance. but i must confess that after watching trump claim obamacare deductibles were so high you need to die a “really slow, vicious death” to exhaust them, accuse the federal reserve and the justice department of corruption, and tell his supporters he doesn’t feel bad if they’re working harder than ever because he is too, clinton’s scripted remarks seemed noticeably dull. she gave a laudable and sensible political speech on an overlooked topic, but it felt like a political speech, a combination of virtue signaling and interest-group outreach. cable covered a trump rally instead, and was rewarded when boxing promoter don king dropped an n-bomb in his introduction. there was nothing controversial or unpredictable in clinton’s remarks; they mostly proved that she and her team had done their homework, and that unlike trump, who talks mostly about himself, she knows enough to portray herself as part of a team. she didn’t even mention trump’s reprehensible imitation of a disabled reporter, because she wanted a more positive message that day. she was careful to say nothing impolitic, which is, basically, politics. geannie bastian, a student with cerebral palsy, said her political awakening came when trump made fun of that reporter. “believe me, i’ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,” she said. “trump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.” in fairness to clinton, there was a portion of the audience that seemed genuinely touched: the disabled and their families. joe kilsheimer, the mayor of a central florida suburb, has a younger brother who was written off by doctors as a hopeless case when he was a baby, but went on to become the first eagle scout with down’s syndrome and lead a productive life. “what hillary said about an inclusive economy really hit home,” kilsheimer said. “i know a lot of people don’t trust her, because they see her filtered through politics and media, but she’s got heart.” geannie bastian, a university of central florida film student with cerebral palsy who gets around in a wheelchair, said she was moved by clinton’s message that people like her matter and deserve to fulfill their potential. but she said her real political awakening came when trump made fun of that reporter, whose hand looks quite similar to hers. “believe me, i’ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,” she said. “trump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.” political scientists disagree about the importance of enthusiasm; voters only get to vote once, no matter how fired up they are, but they’re less likely to turn out to vote if they aren’t fired up. in any case, even at her own events, it’s a lot easier to find voters fired up to vote against the outrageousness of trump than it is to find avid clinton fans. voters of color seem especially riled. i repeatedly heard from black democrats offended by trump’s crusade to deny that the first african-american president was american, and his stereotypes of their families as desperate charity cases with nothing to lose. “my daughter has a doctorate. her husband is an orthodontist. we’ve got plenty to lose,” said betty edwards, a retired educator in the orlando suburbs. “there’s never been a candidate who thought so little of us.” many hispanics are similarly energized by trump’s calls for mass deportations and a wall, sensing not just honest disagreements over immigration policy but a broader push to make them feel like strangers in their own country. andy gutierrez, a singer and puerto rican voting activist who brought a boricua vota sign to the orlando event, says trump has been a one-man registration machine. “he thinks we’re all mexicans, and we’re all bad,” gutierrez said. “people aren’t super-excited about hillary, but trust me, they’ll come out to stop trump.” clinton’s excitement problem is a real problem. at her university event in philadelphia, millennials who had swooned over bernie sanders kept talking about her in the milquetoast terms they might use to describe a reasonably reliable accountant. “she’s ok, i guess,” said thomas davidenko, a freshman at temple. “my main worry is trump’s fingers on the nuclear code. but i’d say she knows what she’s doing.” in orlando, i met more actual clinton fans, especially older women who admired her as a feminist trailblazer, but even her staunch supporters said they’re struggling to persuade friends. lou smith, a union cell-tower technician for at&t, said many of his arab-hating white colleagues at work think she’s a typical lying politician, so they’re voting for trump—and her bernie-loving daughters think the same thing, so they’re staying home. “she’s been around so long, and republicans have thrown so much mud on her,” he said. “she’s great on the issues, but it’s hard to get people to focus on that.” clinton is a policy wonk, and one could imagine that a more normal campaign against a more normal republican would have been closer to her wheelhouse. she could have focused on taxes and health insurance, climate change and diplomacy. she might have framed the election as the democratic bottom-up approach that produced prosperity during her husband’s administration and recovery during obama’s with the trickle-down philosophy that ended in economic collapse under bush. “when bill clinton was in the chair, everybody was doing great, and then everything fell apart before obama fixed it,” said jeneka lloyd, who owns a small painting business in orlando. “man, hillary should talk about that.” but trump is not a normal republican, and 2016 hasn’t focused on his policies, because they’re so insubstantial and flexible, because he’s trashed bush as well as obama, because he has a gift for changing the subject with colorful fox news interviews or incendiary tweets, and because his business record, charity scams and racial provocations provide such a target-rich environment beyond the issues. it’s a lot harder to persuade americans of the magical thinking behind trump’s plan to erase the national debt while expanding the military and slashing taxes than it is to attack him for denigrating a gold star family, looting his own charitable foundation, refusing to release his tax returns, and other unheard-of behavior. meanwhile, the media have balanced the narrative with scandal coverage of her sketchy email situation and her own foundation. her approval ratings have dropped lower than any modern major-party presidential nominee with the lone exception of donald trump. so clinton has ended up in the proverbial mud-wrestling match with a pig. they’ve both gotten dirty. and neither she nor the public has liked it. *** tonight on long island, trump and clinton will meet in a very conventional setting. and as usual, no one really has any idea how trump will try to handle it, which is a big part of what makes him so compelling on television. his team is already warning moderator lester holt not to fact-check the candidates, which makes sense, given trump’s distant relationship with facts. there will be rules governing the debate, but trump’s political brand is all about breaking the rules. what is clear is that trump will portray himself as the candidate of change, which is exactly what he is. he essentially wants to roll back the obama era, repealing the president’s health care reforms, wall street reforms and climate rules, as well as the obama approach to the economy and the war on terror. but trump represents just as dramatic a change from the way politics has been practiced in the tv era, upending every assumption about what is a gaffe, what is disqualifying and what you just can’t say if you want to sit in the oval office and represent an entire nation. if he uses tonight’s debate to brag about his genitalia, or invite the russians to hack his opponent, well, it won’t be normal, but it won’t be the first time, either. and yes, even though she’s unlikely to put it this way, clinton represents the status quo—not just a continuation of democratic policies, but a continuation of the conventional rules of politics. she’s playing the same classical music that previous candidates always played, and it wouldn’t feel so stilted if her opponent hadn’t started playing experimental honky-tonk. the question for 2016 is whether americans are so disgusted with politics as usual that they’ll turn to the politics of trump. that question will be decided not by the thousands of americans who flock to trump rallies or the hundreds who get invited to see clinton, but by the millions who will tune in tonight even though they would never attend a political event. but the question beyond 2016 is what will happen to politics as usual. americans never liked it, and trump has helped expose how cautious, contrived, and anodyne it can be. but he has also helped remind those of us who have complained about it for a living that if caution, restraint, premeditated choreography, and other hallmarks of traditional campaigning aren’t the most authentic elements of successful political leadership, they’re part of it. and while politics as usual does have some bogus kabuki theater qualities, it also reflects some baseline values—showing basic respect to political opponents and people who aren’t like you, staying at least close to the boundaries of plausible facts, recognizing that the things leaders say and do and tweet can have serious consequences—that have constrained politicians in a good way. it’s not clear whether it will be possible to put the norms trump has shattered back together, and while we may not have liked them, we might miss them when they’re gone. not many of us would be better at our jobs if we felt unrestrained from saying whatever popped into our head whenever we wanted. and trump just may have untied the tongues of the politicians of the future.      trump’s high-energy war on american politics      
__label__0 to fact check or not — that was the debate before the debate, one that pitted hillary clinton’s backers against donald trump supporters and even engaged some top journalists. but as the hour of the debate drew closer, only the comparatively small bloomberg tv network publicly said it would be doing any sort of on-screen fact checks during the debate, running them periodically as part of their headline scroll. story continued below despite the demands from the clinton campaign for more media fact checks in the wake of matt lauer’s failure to correct trump’s assertions at nbc’s commander-in-chief forum, none of the major networks has publicly committed to doing concurrent on-screen fact-checking during the debate, when the audience is highest. that would leave the moderator, nbc news anchor lester holt, on his own in deciding whether to weigh in on the candidates’ claims — as both sides tried to publicly pressure him in the hours leading up to the debate. democrats including vice presidential nominee tim kaine called fact-checking crucial to the debate, while republicans echoed trump’s demand that holt refrain from intervening the way that candy crowley did in the second 2012 debate between president barack obama and mitt romney, when she sought to correct romney on his claim that obama hadn’t characterized the benghazi attacks as terrorism. while on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including univision and telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics. of the networks politico surveyed, only bloomberg tv confirmed that it will be doing on-screen fact checking during the debate. network spokespeople said the on-screen fact checks would need to be nearly instantaneous to correlate with the answer the candidate is giving, leading to some high editorial and technical hurdles. only nbc, holt’s home network, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to holt, the only other person on the stage. debate moderators and questioners have been more frequent targets than usual during this election cycle, with the republican national committee even going so far as to pull planned debates with nbc-related networks because it didn’t like how cnbc handled an early primary-election debate. the journalists moderating the debates and providing questions have been singled out by critics in both parties for offenses ranging from asking too many “gotcha” questions to tossing too many softballs. some moderators were criticized for losing control of the debates, while others were knocked for being too controlling themselves. lauer, who sat in silence while trump insisted he never supported the iraq war – despite well-known footage of him saying the opposite – was only the most recent big-name anchor to emerge from a highly touted campaign forum with his reputation challenged. and both the trump and clinton camps have made it clear that they’ll be scrutinizing holt very closely. "these are two of the most difficult people in american politics to interview for very different reasons,” said veteran cbs news anchor and debate moderator bob schieffer. "so i think a moderators [of the three scheduled debates] are going to have their hands full. but i think all of them are veteran journalists and they will have done their homework by the time they get to the debate and they’ll do fine." for 90 minutes, with no break, holt will lob questions of his own choosing at the candidates, guiding how and when they will respond. schieffer, who said he has not given advice to holt but has to some of the other moderators, said the hardest part for a moderator is not the vaunted “fact checking” that lauer was so criticized for not enacting, but rather keeping track of the time and making sure the candidates get to the point. “[moderators] are always part of the story,” schieffer said. "when there’s someone to blame for something, people first turn to the press. that seems to be our role traditionally, that it’s our fault. you can’t help but become part of the story. you need to remember that going in. this scrutiny now is so intense, if you hadn’t been through it before you better get used to it now.” despite the evident pressure, handling the first debate will be a huge opportunity for holt, who took over “nightly news” from brian williams under less than ideal circumstances. instead of a grandly orchestrated rollout, holt took over the anchor desk with little fanfare, as all of the drama focused on williams’ fabrications and ultimate suspension. (williams is now back on air, anchoring for msnbc.) holt has stayed away from doing any publicity ahead of the debates and stopped anchoring “nightly news” last tuesday to prepare for monday night’s faceoff. schieffer said moderators do best when they deliver short and simple questions that force the candidates to explain themselves. "a key question for both these candidates is 'how are you going to do that?’ ” schieffer said. “… how are you going to get the money to do it and how are you going to put together the coalition you would need if it’s a law to get something like that passed?" the clinton campaign hasn’t been directly in touch with holt about its expectations for his handling of fact-checking duties on trump – whom clinton allies say routinely sprinkles his interviews and debate performances with assertions that journalists know aren’t true but are reluctant to challenge. but the campaign has made little secret of its insistence that holt hold trump accountable. "for the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give donald trump an unfair advantage,” clinton communications director jennifer palmieri said during a conference call with reporters on friday. "we do believe it is the role of the moderator . . . to call out those lies and to do that in real time." but the two former presidential debate moderators, scheiffer and lehrer, said that’s not necessarily how they would do it. becoming the fact checker risks putting oneself in the position of crowley, whom many republicans believe damaged romney’s performance unfairly. "my thought is yes the moderators have to fact-check, but the first fact-check opporutnity should go to the candidate themselves,” scheiffer said. “if candidate a said something and is blatantly wrong you want to give candidate b the first opportunity to fact check that." if the second candidate doesn’t step in, scheiffer said, the moderator has “the responsibility” to “state for the record what the facts are.” jim lehrer, the former pbs newshour anchor who has moderated 12 presidential debates, said he also would strongly prefer to have the candidates fact-check each other than to step in himself. "usually the way you do that with simply the candidate there, you say 'would you agree with that, is that how you see it?’ ” lehrer said. “in debates i tried to not do that [fact check] because i didn’t want to get in the way." both schieffer and lehrer said it’s almost guaranteed that holt will be criticized by one side or the other, if not both. when lehrer stayed mostly out of obama and romney’s way during the first presidential debate in 2012, he was criticized for not taking enough control. that same year, schieffer was criticized for allowing the final debate to stray from foreign policy, the chosen topic for that debate. “this will be the ultimate ‘rashomon’ test,” lehrer said, referring to the famous movie in which an event is viewed differently by each character. “they always are, this one will just be a little more extreme." darren samuelsohn contributed to this report.      networks reject on-screen fact checking during debate      
__label__0 as the coal industry and the obama administration brace for a potentially momentous legal showdown over climate-change policy at a federal appeals court this week, the industry is mounting part of its argument in an unusual venue: on the radio. for the past few weeks, the american coalition for clean coal electricity has been running radio ads focused squarely on tuesday's oral arguments before a 10-judge, en banc sitting of the d.c. circuit court of appeals. story continued below "on september 27th the d.c. circuit court of appeals has an important decision to make on epa’s power plan. it’s a decision that affects every american’s ability to have affordable energy and jeopardizes every state’s ability to make their own energy policies and it will be a clear violation of the 10th amendment to the constitution," a serious-sounding announcer declares as ominous music plays in the background. "it is our duty to uphold the constitution and say no to epa’s power plan." a video posted online by the same pro-coal group uses similar language, suggesting a need to take action on tuesday. “on september 27, it is our duty to uphold the constitution and the people it is designed to protect," the video says. the ads and the video never explain precisely who's being called on to do "our duty," but the epa plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants is not going before congress this week nor is there some referendum. the only people who get to vote tuesday (or soon thereafter) are 10 of the 11 active judges on the d.c. circuit. (chief judge merrick garland has bowed out of hearing cases while his supreme court nomination is pending.) legal ethics rules prohibit lawyers involved in a case from engaging in out-of-court communications with judges under most circumstances. judges are usually prohibited from initiating or permitting out-of-court contact about a case and are supposed to put such communications on the record when they do occur. the theory behind the rules is that cases should be decided based on written briefs and arguments presented in the courtroom. the american coalition for clean coal energy is one of the parties challenging the environmental protection agency power-plant rules in the series of cases set to be heard tuesday during an extraordinary court session planned to stretch for more than three-and-a-half hours, not counting a lunch break. a spokeswoman for the group, laura sheehan, said she was not available for an interview friday. she did not respond to emailed queries about the cost and scope of the ad campaign or the target audience. “the d.c. circuit court of appeals’ decision is critically important as it will either put a halt to epa’s out-of-control regulatory decision making or give it the green light to continue to run roughshod over states’ constitutional rights,” sheehan said in a statement posted on the group's website. prominent legal ethics experts said there's little doubt the ads are aimed at influencing the d.c. circuit judges. "they're obviously aimed at intimidating the court into doing what is politically popular, letting the judges know there will be repercussions if they don't decide it the right way," said richard painter,a law professor at the university of minnesota and a white house ethics lawyer under president george w. bush. "they're not running these ads aimed at people affected by the administration's position on coal. they're aimed at the judges and their families and friends trying to put the heat on them....this is one more step in the direction of politicizing the courts." painter said the ads would be improper if lawyers for the parties before the court were involved. "i don't think lawyers litigating the case would have anything to do with this. that would be highly unprofessional," he said. the ads and online video quote renowned harvard law professor laurence tribe saying alarmingly that endorsing the administration's crackdown on greenhouse gas emissions would be like "burning the constitution." the comments come from congressional testimony tribe offered last year. the group's video actually shows fire appearing to consume the nation's founding document tribe did not respond to emails asking if he was involved in producing the ads or approved of them. he's set to argue at tuesday's court session on behalf of coal mining firm peabody energy and several others members of the coal-industry coalition running the ads. some ethics lawyers said the ads are protected by the first amendment, but may not be a good idea. "the trade group is engaging in free speech. but it risks annoying the judges," said stephen gillers, a law professor at new york university. "assuming that risk is unwise because the judges won't be influenced. i bet the industry's lawyers are themselves chagrined by the campaign. the judges are expected to ignore what they may hear just as they are expected to ignore, [such as] an editorial, and decide based only on the record." advertising advocating for a specific outcome in a pending court case is highly unusual, but not unprecedented. when the supreme court was considering the constitutionality of bans on gay marriage last year, a group of christian pastors and activists took out a full-page washington post ad days before the decision, urging the court not to require states to recognize gay marriage. the court did so anyway, by 5-4 vote. in-person protests related to supreme court cases are common, but the court has managed to use its rules to push them off its grounds and onto the adjoining sidewalks. last year, the d.c. circuit upheld those rules. the supreme court has also upheld a state law that courthouse banned demonstrations near courthouses, even when aimed at judges rather than jurors. the lengths to which the coal industry is willing to go to try to influence the outcome of this week's arguments may reflect the unusually pivotal role the d.c. circuit could play in the case—one that may wind up being more critical than the supreme court. that's because it seems possible, if not likely, that the shorthanded high court could split 4-4 in the case. if that happens, the d.c. circuit ruling would stand. on february 9, the supreme court voted, 5-4, to halt implementation of the epa power-plant rules until the d.c. circuit resolves the case and the justices have a chance to decide whether to take up a virtually-certain petition to review that decision. four days later, justice antonin scalia was found dead in his room during a trip to a texas ranch. the earlier vote on the stay application suggests it wouldn't be granted if the issue arose today and suggests—although it is far from certain— that the court could divide along ideological lines on the underlying case.      coal industry mounts unusual court-focused ad campaign

already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency. she’s been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and trump was engaged to marla maples. “everyone makes the orange jokes, but trump is something of a black box -- running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring american prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness). he’s bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a d student who doesn't read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesn't read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, can't even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing. “1. does he actually know - or care to know - the basic information needed to competently run the country? … 2. does trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of american constitutional government? … 3. why won’t trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts? … 4. what's the

israeli-palestinian conflict and said he didn’t want to assign fault in the never-ending impasse. trump struck a very different tone on sunday, telling israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that he would recognize an undivided jerusalem as israel’s eternal capital and squarely blaming palestinian ‘hatred and violence’ for the ongoing failure of middle east peace efforts. “not to be outdone, in her own meeting with netanyahu a few hours later, clinton told the israeli leader that she opposes, in the words of a senior campaign aide, ‘any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the u.n. security council.’ … the two get-togethers spotlighted the u.s.-israel relationship on the eve of the first presidential debate and likely drew the close attention of jewish american voters. they also prompted complaints from trump critics that netanyahu was legitimizing trump on the world stage.” http://politi.co/2dvqqz7 nyt editorial board, part ii -- “why donald trump should not be president: donald trump is a man who dwells in bigotry, bluster and false promises”: “when donald trump began his improbable run for president 15 months ago, he offered his wealth and television celebrity as credentials, then slyly added a twist of fearmongering about mexican ‘rapists’ flooding across the southern border. from that moment of combustion, it became clear that mr. trump’s views were matters of dangerous impulse and cynical pandering rather than thoughtful politics. yet he has attracted throngs of americans who ascribe higher purpose to him than he has

money to achieve that goal — $26.8 million as of july — than ever before. “this really is emily’s list’s moment,” schriock said. “we are having our most successful fundraising cycle and we are going to have by far the largest women voter program, which is our independent expenditure arm, that we’ve ever had.” the bar at the debate is higher for hillary clinton: “this is a really important moment and the first time that americans have seen a woman standing on that stage for a presidential debate and i think she’s going to be ready. i know there is no one who prepares harder than hillary clinton, but the stakes are high and the bar is really high for her. i don’t think there is anything they can do about that. like so many of our women candidates they just have to deal with it.” stunned at trump’s comments on women: “i think it is really really important for all of the women in this country… to know that donald trump has these views and has no problem just letting these really offensive words come off his tongue.” trump’s policy targeting women is a sham: “it was atrocious policy. it was the kind of thing that a campaign throws together with less than 60 days left when they know they are losing particularly women voters. women voters and americans in general are obviously not going to fall for something like that.” female candidates will determine senate majority: “catherine cortez masto of nevada, maggie hassan in new hampshire, katie mcginty in pennsylvania, and now deborah ross, who we are so proud of in north carolina, those four races are the

__label__0 turkish president recep tayyip erdoğan chalked up donald trump’s proposal to ban muslims from entering the u.s. to simple political posturing and said that such a plan would not be “remotely possible.” speaking through a translator in an interview with msnbc, erdoğan was asked if trump’s campaign rhetoric would prompt him to advise turkish citizens, most of whom are muslim, not to visit the u.s. if the manhattan billionaire wins the white house. he responded by saying he thinks such a ban would never actually come to fruition. story continued below “well, i don't think that this is remotely possible because politics is a marathon and it's a long process,” he said. “many things can be said throughout the rallies before elections and things will turn out to be very different post-elections. no political figure, no politician in this world is confined to their own local grounds.” trump has backed away from that muslim ban, first introduced during the republican primary, in favor of a ban on all immigration from nations compromised by terrorism. in some speeches and interviews, he has said he would ban immigration from all nations where sufficient vetting cannot occur. erdoğan was also asked which candidate, trump or democrat hillary clinton, would be have the better relationship with turkey if elected, a question he refused to answer. “well, you are entrapping me. i'm not going to fall into that trap,” erdoğan said. “the best thing for me is to see the will of the people being served in the united states, the choice of the american people will be the right choice. i believe democracy more than anything else.”      turkish president erdoğan: trump’s muslim ban isn’t possible      
__label__0 the reliably liberal editorial board of the los angeles times has endorsed hillary clinton, calling her "an experienced, thoughtful and deeply knowledgeable public servant" in a lengthy editorial. the paper lambasted donald trump, by contrast, as a "thin-skinned demagogue who is unqualified and unsuited to be president." story continued below echoing criticisms leveled by clinton and her allies, the editorial attacks the billionaire businessman as someone who "has never held elected office and has shown himself temperamentally unfit to do so. "he has run a divisive, belligerent, dishonest campaign, repeatedly aligning himself with racists, strongmen and thugs while maligning or dismissing large segments of the american public. electing trump could be catastrophic for the nation," the board writes. the editorial then goes on detail clinton's perceived strengths and attack trump's record at length. but it also wrestles with the former secretary of state's perceived shortcomings, noting her "penchant for secrecy" and dinging her "for adjusting her positions to match popular opinion and for being a little too comfortable with the use of military force." ultimately, the board concludes: "to be a great president, she will have to struggle to overcome her own weaknesses. but compared with trump’s infirmities as a candidate, her failings are insignificant. it’s absurd — and perilous — to portray this election, as so many are doing, as a choice of the 'lesser of two evils' or to suggest that her flaws are in any way on a level with his." the la times also endorsed clinton ahead of the california democratic primary. it also endorsed barack obama in 2008 "without hesitation," and again in 2012, hailing his "steady leadership."      la times endorses clinton, bashes trump

__label__0 if not for the presidency, bobby knight is pushing donald trump for sainthood. “i actually enjoyed the day with saint donald and i've enjoyed watching him. i've really enjoyed watching him, i think go about things the way that he thought things should be.,” the legendary basketball coach said friday on “fox & friends,” echoing a sobriquet he has begun using for the republican nominee in recent days. “i think the man has a lot of really, really good things to bring to the table.” story continued below remarking upon trump’s transformation as a presidential candidate, the famously hot-headed hall of fame coach said he was not sure if he would say the boastful businessman has become “milder.” “but i just have seen him take a different approach to how things should be and go about attacking things and what's wrong,” knight said. “i've really been impressed with the interest that he has in seeing that things are done in the right way.” asked whether he had discussed the ongoing unrest in charlotte, north carolina, after police shot and killed an african-american man, knight replied, “not really.” “i mean that's -- you know, what is there to say?” he remarked. “it was wrong. it was—you know, you could go forever. that was not something that we really directed our attention to.” as far as what the two did discuss, knight made note of trump’s business records and ability to solve problems. “and that's what i think is the most important thing he brings to this job. the guy is going -- hey, this isn't working, we got to figure out what's wrong with this and we got to get this straightened out,” knight said. “that, to me, is what being president is all about, and i don't think -- has there ever been a president that hasn't had problems?” the best president at that “might have been reagan,” knight said, adding, “that’s what donald trump brings to the table.” when it comes to hillary clinton’s assertion that trump lacks the temperament to be commander in chief, knight invoked his favorite presidents to argue the opposite. “well, i think that being pretty strong willed is a pretty good asset to have,” he added. “i mean, who had -- has there ever been a president that was better than harry truman and harry truman had a damn good temperament.”      bobby knight lauds 'saint donald' for temperament      
__label__0 president barack obama wants hillary clinton to “be yourself and explain what motivates you” when she takes the stage monday night for her first presidential debate. obama offered the advice during an interview on abc with “good morning america” host robin roberts from the soon-to-open national museum of african-american history and culture on the national mall. the two spent the bulk of their interview discussing the museum and what lessons it might offer for protesters in charlotte who have at times become violent. story continued below but roberts took time to ask the president what advice he might offer to clinton ahead of monday night’s debate, to which the president responded that his former secretary of state should allow the american public to see her “i've gotten to know hillary and seen her work, seen her in tough times and in good times,” obama said of his former secretary of state. “she's in this for the right reasons.” monday night’s debate will be held at new york’s hofstra university and is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. it will be moderated by nbc nightly news anchor lester holt.      obama's debate advice to clinton: 'be yourself'      
__label__0 former virginia gov. bob mcdonnell, whose conviction on corruption charges was overturned by the supreme court last june, told msnbc’s “morning joe” on friday that “i’ve got my phd in suffering.” “you learn more in life through suffering than you do success, and i’ve learned a lot,” the former virginia governor told host mika brzezinski. story continued below mcdonnell, once considered a candidate to join the 2012 republican presidential ticket as mitt romney’s running mate, was convicted in 2014 on 11 corruption-related felony counts stemming from the over $175,000 in gifts and loans the former governor and his wife accepted from virginia businessman johnnie williams. those gifts included vacations, designer clothing and a rolex watch. but mcdonnell contended that those gifts and loans had never prompted him to provide any special treatment for williams. on friday, mcdonnell said “there was never any quo” in the quid pro quo case that the prosecution built against him. the governor’s conviction was overturned unanimously by the supreme court last june. chief justice john roberts, who wrote the court’s opinion in the decision, said prosecutors had relied on a “boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute” and added that “setting up a meeting, calling another public official, or hosting an event does not, standing alone, qualify as an ‘official act.’” mcdonnell admitted that the case had been difficult on his family but also noted that four of his grandchildren were born during the legal process surrounding his case. two of them, he said, were born shortly after court hearings and all of their births “were a sign to me there is a bright future on the other side of this and things are going to be okay.” he said that even though he complied with virginia’s laws, he regretted taking “my eye off the ball” in monitoring what gifts his family members had received. he also admitted that accepting a business loan from williams was “a big red flag” and “probably not good judgment on my part.” “i'm glad to be vacated, but i have done a deep dive of my entire life, 62 years. what have i done right, wrong? how can i be a better person?” he said. “so now that i'm on the other side of it, i think it's been an experience worth going through. i'll be a better person.”      bob mcdonnell: 'i’ve got my phd in suffering'      
__label__0 north carolina gov. pat mccrory said friday that he had "very positive" conversations the previous day with both donald trump and president barack obama. the republican governor, appearing on "fox & friends," said he "explained the situation to both mr. trump and the president and explained the dynamics that are occurring." story continued below "i told them both that we have some anarchists who do not have legitimate reason to protest," mccrory said. "we have other protests that are doing an incredible job of expressing their viewpoint, which needs to be heard." in addition, mccrory said he spoke to obama and trump "about the courage of our police officers and our national guard." after speaking with mccrory on thursday, trump tweeted his appreciation for the governor in the wake of multiple nights of protests following the police killing of an african-american man in charlotte. "he is doing a tremendous job under tough circumstances," trump wrote. democratic nominee hillary clinton called both charlotte mayor jennifer roberts and rep. alma adams (d-n.c.) on thursday evening to discuss the recent events and to offer any assistance. mccrory declared a state of emergency on wednesday night, and the city instituted a midnight curfew on thursday.      mccrory decries 'anarchists' in north carolina protests      
__label__0 utah sen. mike lee on friday swiftly shot down the idea that he would accept a nomination to the supreme court from donald trump. "sen lee already has the job he wants which is why he is campaigning to represent the great people of utah again this year," lee spokesman conn carroll said in response to politico, after nbc news reported on a new list of potential supreme court nominees that trump would propose as president. story continued below lee is one of 10 on the expanded list, which also includes neil gorsuch, a judge of the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit; margaret a. ryan, a judge of the u.s. court of appeals for the armed forces; edward mansfield, an iowa supreme court justice; keith blackwell, a georgia supreme court justice; charles canady, a florida supreme court justice; timothy tymkovich, the chief judge of the u.s. court of appeals for the tenth circuit; amul thapar, a u.s. district court judge for the eastern district of kentucky; federico moreno, a u.s. district court judge for the southern district of florida; and robert young, the chief justice of the michigan supreme court. trump’s decision earned praise from judicial crisis network director carrie severino, who clerked for justice clarence thomas. “donald trump continues to take unprecedented steps to demonstrate that he intends to appoint justices like scalia, thomas and alito,” severino said in a statement. “conservatives should be very pleased by the steps he has taken, and if he lives up to his promises we will have a court that truly puts the rule of law ahead of political preferences.” lee has refused to endorse trump for president, although he did offer praise for trump's first list of potential justices unveiled in may, which included his brother thomas, a utah supreme court justice. "it wasn't just that there were some great names on that list, that was the best, most conservative supreme court shortlist i've ever seen," lee said at the time. "and i was thrilled by that." seung min kim contributed.      sen. mike lee shoots down trump supreme court trial balloon      
__label__0 top hillary clinton aide cheryl mills received an immunity deal from the justice department in the fbi’s investigation into the former secretary of state’s private email server, records shown to congress revealed friday, re-injecting the email controversy into the presidential campaign just days before her first debate with donald trump. in addition to mills, clinton's former chief of staff at state, grants of partial immunity were also extended to former clinton aide heather samuelson, who worked as state's white house liaison and later as a private attorney for clinton and to john bentel, who was director of the the information resources management section in the secretary of state's office, lawmakers said. story continued below the newly disclosed information brings to five the number of individuals known to have received some form of immunity in connection with the fbi probe, which ended with the bureau recommending that no charges be brought against clinton or her aides for mishandling classified information. "this is beyond explanation. the fbi was handing out immunity agreements like candy,” house oversight chairman jason chaffetz (r-utah) said friday in a statement. “i've lost confidence in this investigation and i question the genuine effort in which it was carried out. immunity deals should not be a requirement for cooperating with the fbi." the immunity grants to mills and samuelson were narrow, covering only their handover of laptops used in 2014, after clinton left state, to conduct a review of the former secretary's emails to separate work-related messages from those purely personal in nature. the immunity came after the women were interviewed by the fbi and did not cover any of their statements. people familiar with the immunity offer said it was not related to the lawyers' testimony, noting that fbi director james comey said in july there was no evidence of a deletion aimed at frustrating the investigation. a lawyer for mills and samuelson, beth wilkinson, said she requested the immunity grants because of inter-agency disputes about whether some information in clinton's emails was classified. "as the government indicated in these letters, the doj and fbi considered my clients to be witnesses and nothing more. indeed, the justice department assured us that they believed my clients did nothing wrong. at all points my clients cooperated with the government’s investigation, including voluntarily participating in interviews with the fbi and doj," wilkinson said in a statement. "the letters released to the hill today only covered the computers that my clients had used in performing their legal work," wilkinsion added. "because of the confusion surrounding the various agencies’ positions on the after-the-fact classification decisions, i advised my clients to accept this letter from doj." bentel, however, received immunity before speaking with the fbi, people familiar with the situation said. former state employees told agency investigators bentel brushed back their concerns about clinton's email setup. democrats on the house oversight committee stressed in a statement emailed to reporters that the immunity offers to mills and samuelson were "very limited." "these very limited immunity agreements did not extend to any testimony before congress, statements to the fbi, or assertions to any other investigators," they said. the clinton campaign attributed the information's release to the proximity of monday's presidential debate. "house republicans are trying to make something out of nothing by rummaging through the files of a justice department investigation that was closed months ago without any charges whatsoever, and leaking selective details three days before the first presidential debate," clinton spokesman brian fallon said in a statement, noting that mills and samuelson cooperated fully with the fbi's inquiry and "had already given full interviews to the investigators." a top aide to donald trump's presidential campaign said word of the additional immunity grants underscored the recklessness of clinton's conduct. "revelations that three additional individuals, including cheryl mills, were granted immunity from prosecution in hillary clinton’s email scandal shows this was without a doubt a criminal scheme," trump aide jason miller said in a statement. "at its heart, clinton’s secret server was an end run around government transparency laws designed to hide corruption between the clinton foundation and her state department, an arrangement which ultimately put our national security and sensitive diplomatic efforts at risk. no one with judgment this bad should be allowed to serve as president of the united states or hold any public office." miller also suggested that the immunity grants were aimed at preventing clinton from facing justice in the case. "what has become abundantly clear is that the obama administration is protecting hillary clinton from accountability at all costs because she will keep the rigged system in washington in place. in light of this development, hillary clinton must immediately come forward and promise the american people that none of these individuals will ever serve in any capacity in her administration," the trump aide added. for weeks, house republicans have been seeking the fbi's full file in the probe and, last week, issued a subpoena demanding the records. republicans disclosed the immunity agreements just after learning about them in investigative records shown to congressional staff by the justice department on friday. immunity offers to witnesses are not made by the fbi, but by the justice department. a department spokesman declined to comment. a spokeswoman for the fbi had no immediate comment. it was previously disclosed that prosecutors granted immunity to former state department computer specialist bryan pagliano and to a computer technician clinton hired through a private firm, paul combetta of denver-based platte river networks. the immunity deals for the two appear to be broader than those given to mills and samuelson, although no one in the probe is known to have received full immunity. rachael bade contributed to this report.      top clinton aide cheryl mills granted partial immunity in email investigation      
__label__0 colleges and universities that don't spend their endowments to directly benefit students should lose the tax breaks on those endowments, donald trump said thursday night. echoing house republicans who have questioned why wealthy universities with fat endowments keep raising tuition prices, trump said during a rally in chester township, pa., that it's time for colleges to spend their endowments to help students — rather than on "other things that don’t matter.” story continued below trump said too many colleges use the money they have to pay for administrators, equity fund managers and to put donors' names on buildings. "what a lot of people don’t know is that universities get massive tax breaks for their massive endowments," trump said. "these huge, multi-billion-dollar endowments are tax-free, but too many of these universities don’t use the money to help with the tuition and student debt.” trump said he would work with congress to push reforms to help students and families, so that colleges make "good faith" efforts to curtail student debt. the gop presidential nominee said paying for college is one of the top issues he hears about from voters. going to college, trump said, “should be easier to access, pay for and finish, and a lot of people want to do that.” "we have to deal with these universities," trump told the crowd. "we have to break the cycle."      trump threatens to take tax breaks away from wealthy universities      
__label__0 charlotte mayor jennifer roberts on friday blasted donald trump explanation of the violence and unrest in her city, a day after the republican nominee pointed to "drugs" as "a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television." "i think it's presumptuous for him to make a conclusion like that without having thorough conversations with some of the folks who are here on the ground and really aware of what is going on and what the reasoning is," roberts, a democrat, told cnn. "several of our council members were out in the crowd last night, talking to people. i've been listening to folks. i've gotten lots of phone calls, i’ve talked to a lot of folks on the street. we have a much better understanding than mr. trump." story continued below asked to ascribe a cause to the recent unrest, roberts remarked that there are "a couple of things," citing "distrust" with how police handle african-americans compared to whites, despite a "strong history of community policing." "there's also a concern when you look at what's happening nationally and having this occur in other cities as well," roberts went on to say. "but even deeper than that, you know, we have a history of racial disparity. and we are working very hard in our city to bridge that gap, to make sure that whether we're looking at education or economic opportunity, social justice, all of those things, we are working very hard to make sure opportunity -- equally around our city." trump spoke with north carolina gov. pat mccrory on thursday, while democratic nominee hillary clinton spoke with roberts and democratic rep. alma adams.      charlotte mayor knocks trump for blaming violence on 'drugs'      
__label__0 donald trump will not be fazed by the presence of another brash billionaire businessman, mark cuban, in the front row of the upcoming debate, the republican nominee's campaign asserted friday. cuban, a hillary clinton supporter who has repeatedly criticized trump, tweeted thursday night that he would be in attendance at what he termed the "humbling at hofstra," in reference to the debate's site at the long island university. story continued below "i just think it’s worth noting that this is one of those things that could get inside somebody’s head. and mark cuban, sitting right there in front of him," fox business host maria bartiromo said during a discussion with national spokeswoman katrina pierson. pierson objected to that assessment, remarking, "no one can get in donald trump's head. no one can get in mr. trump’s head." "he's going to be focused and he’s gonna be ... focused on talking to the american people," pierson said. "it doesn't matter who's in the front row. mr. trump is gonna make his case at monday night." campaign manager kellyanne conway mocked clinton's invitation of cuban later on the same network, calling it "a typical monday night for hillary clinton spending it with billionaires who don't particularly care for donald trump." conway added, "what's he gonna do -- make funny faces at donald trump?"      pierson on cuban at debate: 'no one can get in donald trump's head'      
__label__0 donald trump won’t be winging his debate performance monday, but the republican presidential nominee also hasn’t been cramming his head with microchips and binders like hillary clinton, his campaign manager said friday. “of course not. he need not wing it,” trump’s campaign manager, kellyanne conway, told fox business. “there’s a difference between being spontaneous and just, you know, being yourself at the debate stage.” story continued below trump and clinton will square off monday in new york at hofstra university for the first presidential debate. while clinton has taken time off the trail for debate prep, trump has largely eschewed the traditional debate prep process. his campaign, however, maintains that the real estate mogul will be prepared for monday's bout. “i don’t think he’s locked up in a cabin for two weeks like other people have been — or currently are — cramming their heads with microchips and binders, but he’s a brilliant man,” conway said, taking an obvious shot at clinton’s preparation. conway said no one is playing clinton in mock debate sessions because “we all know hillary clinton very well, so those of us who are intimately involved with this process feel confident that we understand hillary clinton’s record, we understand her vision — her lack thereof — for the country.” clinton’s performance at nbc’s commander in chief forum earlier this month “wasn’t her best night,” conway continued, adding that it was “a very typical debate performance or forum performance for hillary clinton.” “she’s easily flummoxed,” conway said. “she did not see bernie sanders coming in the primaries this year, she did not do well in debates against barack obama in 2008, and she never saw — she never anticipated our comeback in the last five weeks.” conway also blasted clinton for asking supporters this week why she isn’t leading trump by 50 points. her remark was “a very honest moment” for clinton but appeared “a little bit desperate,” said conway, who went on to ask, “who in the world tells people, ‘why am i not 50 points ahead of donald trump?’” “she cannot believe — it’s so beneath her to be running against donald trump for president of the united states. she simply can’t get him out of her mind,” conway said. “why is every subject and predicate out of her mouth ‘donald trump’? so, you know, that’s the person you’re going to see in the debates, someone who very much has her head occupied by him.”      trump camp: clinton cramming her head with ‘microchips and binders’ for debate      
__label__0 ted cruz on friday said he would vote for donald trump for president and that he would encourage others to do the same, reversing months of opposition to his bitter primary rival. "after many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, i have decided that on election day, i will vote for the republican nominee, donald trump," he wrote in a facebook post. story continued below cruz said he endorsed both because of his primary pledge to support the party nominee, as well as his concerns about democratic nominee hillary clinton. "last year, i promised to support the republican nominee. and i intend to keep my word," cruz said. "second, even though i have had areas of significant disagreement with our nominee, by any measure hillary clinton is wholly unacceptable — that’s why i have always been #neverhillary." a trump adviser said trump and cruz spoke after the endorsement. for months, cruz had avoided endorsing trump, his primary foe in an intensely personal race. people close to him were sharply divided on friday over the decision, hours before he made his endorsement. “if he announces he endorses, it destroys his political brand,” said someone who had worked for cruz's campaign. steve deace, a prominent conservative iowa radio host who was a major cruz backer, also tweeted friday that the senator would endorse trump. a spokeswoman for cruz did not respond to multiple requests for comment. "this is gonna be a political disaster," deace texted after cruz made his decision official. "sad. unavoidable. entirely self inflicted." trump responded in a statement that he was "greatly honored" by the nod. "we have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent," trump said. "i look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make america great again." cruz had previously gone as far as to tell republicans to “vote your conscience” at the republican national convention, rather than urging them to get behind the nominee. since then, cruz, who may face a primary challenge in his 2018 senate reelection campaign, has come under mounting pressure to get behind trump, though many cruz loyalists see an endorsement as unacceptable. at the outset of the republican primary, cruz went out of his way to praise trump, expecting that the real estate mogul’s support would crumble, and cruz would be the beneficiary. but as the primary continued and trump moved into an increasingly strong position in the race, cruz sought to fashion himself as the conservative alternative to trump, repeatedly describing his opponent as a liberal who had few differences with hillary clinton. the race turned increasingly personal between the two, with trump attacking cruz’s wife and seeking to link cruz’s father to conspiracy theories about assassinating former president john f. kennedy. on the day that he dropped out of the race, cruz took his criticism of trump to a new level, accusing him of being a “pathological liar,” a “serial philanderer” and an “utterly amoral” “bully.” the personal differences between the two of them, as well as trump’s willingness to flaunt conservative orthodoxy that many cruz loyalists embrace, has made supporting the nominee a nonstarter for many of the senator’s most committed backers. but slowly, other conservative leaders, including many who backed cruz in the primary, have gotten on board with trump, and have made clear publicly that cruz should do the same. they view the election as a binary election between hillary clinton and trump, rather than accepting the more nuanced stance that cruz took at the convention. “i think he should give a nod of support,” said tony perkins, the head of the family research council, who was previously an important cruz backer. “i think a lot of folks that supported ted feel that way. given the choices before us, yeah, i would like to see ted give his support to trump at this point.” the initial calculation at the rnc from many who backed cruz’s decision was that, assuming trump went up in flames in november, cruz would emerge from the election respected as one of the last principled conservatives, willing to serve as the final bulwark against a candidate who violated many of the values conservatives hold dear. supporting trump would tie cruz’s fortunes more closely to his, a possible complication for cruz, whose fans have long wanted him to look at running for president again in 2020. but there is a more urgent need to attend to: cruz’s unwillingness to support trump has become an issue in his home state as he prepares for senate re-election. the morning after he refused to support trump at the rnc, the texas delegation breakfast broke out into chaos as delegates split over whether or not cruz should support the nominee. since then, rep. mike mccaul (r-texas), a possible cruz primary challenger for cruz’s senate seat, has been using the senator’s unwillingness to support trump as a means of attacking cruz. mccaul attacked cruz on the laura ingraham show this week for breaking his pledge to support the nominee, declaring he was “very angry” about the dissension. “he broke his word,” said mccaul, the wealthy chairman of the house homeland security committee. the texas senator has been gradually making moves to soothe his often poor relations with fellow senators since his primary loss, helping raise money for at-risk republicans and donating $100,000 to the senate gop’s campaign arm. but many republicans on capitol hill have prodded him to go further and hold his nose with an endorsement. while several republicans said cruz’s bloc of conservative voters could make the difference for trump, others said any endorsement would be more about helping secure cruz’s own political standing than trump’s. “i don’t think endorsements matter,” said one republican senator. agreed perkins, “at this point, i think it’s probably more beneficial to ted than it is to trump, to show that ted is a team player. and look, there’s a lot of folks, like myself, [for whom] donald trump was not our first choice. but he is working hard to gain the support and confidence of conservatives, and the alternative is clear.” of people close to cruz who disagree with any indication of support for trump, some say that voting for trump — but attempting to distinguish between a vote and an endorsement, as senators such as kelly ayotte have done — might be forgivable. but a full-on endorsement, especially one that would entail campaigning for the republican nominee, would be harder to stomach. cruz’s move toward his former rival takes away the most prominent anti-trump holdout in congress, leaving sens. jeff flake of arizona, susan collins of maine, ben sasse of nebraska, lindsey graham of south carolina, mark kirk of illinois and mike lee of utah as the remaining senators who either oppose or haven’t supported trump. few have shown any inclination to follow cruz’s lead. “i’m against hillary clinton for president, that’s where i am,” heller said thursday. “we’ll go through the debate and see how it plays out.” lee, cruz’s strongest defender and closest friend in the senate, indicated he has no plans to follow cruz’s lead. in a statement, lee said he is watching “each candidate's grasp of — and willingness to work tirelessly to restore — federalism and separation of powers. “i am always eager to support any candidate willing to make those structural constitutional protections a priority. in this race and in every other, i will continue to use the same criteria,” lee said. but trump has made some overtures to lee, on friday including him on a list of his potential choices for a supreme court nomination. lee was not interested. asked about a possible endorsement of trump, jason johnson, cruz’s chief strategist on the campaign, responded with what

__label__0 newark — a donald trump aide who worked for gov. chris christie testified in federal court friday that the republican governor’s office meticulously tracked which local mayors had received special treatment and how likely they were to endorse his re-election campaign. matt mowers, who was an aide in christie’s office of intergovernmental affairs, or iga, told prosecutors that the office used a google document to note when a local mayor or council person had been invited to sporting events, invited to breakfast at the governor’s mansion or received steel from the wreckage of the world trade center. story continued below mowers, testifying in the george washington bridge lane closure trial, said officials were given a score on a scale of 1-10 about how likely they were to endorse christie’s 2013 campaign. mowers said in u.s. district court that the democratic mayor of fort lee, where the bridge is located, was among those officials. mowers had been assigned to the mayor, mark sokolich, and other officials in the northern part of the state, as part of his job at a regional director with the office. sokolich, he wrote in the document, had a good chance of being persuaded. “only thing that could prevent endorsement is possible ambition for higher office (county executive),” mowers said he wrote about the democrat from bergen county. mowers said he spoke to sokolich frequently, meeting with the mayor about once a month and also calling every few weeks. they attended sporting events. they helped get port authority funding for local shuttle buses, with the governor writing the bistate agency a letter requesting the buses. mowers said sokolich even request a letter of recommendation from the governor to help his son get into rutgers university. the two had a good, friendly relationship, mowers said. by 2013, they began discussing the possibility that sokolich would endorse christie — at the mayor’s request, said mowers, who is currently a national field coordinator working on the trump campaign. sokolich testified earlier in the week that mowers had been pushing him to endorse and that he’d felt uncomfortable at times. but mowers said the mayor was so interested that he discussed having the entire town council endorse christie, and suggested doing so after the democratic primary so as not to upset the county party bosses. “given that he brought it up and the rest of the council was interested in endorsing as well,” mowers said, he thought it “was something he would consider.” but sokolich ultimately told him he couldn’t do it, mowers said. mowers said that at a meeting in march 2013 in fort lee, the mayor said he was concerned about his private business as a zoning attorney, and that he could lose contracts with local municipalities for endorsing christie. mowers sent a text message to a higher ranking employee in the iga saying what happened: “unfortunately, i think sokolich is going to be a no. it’s a shame, too, i really like the guy.” he added in another message: “he flat out said ‘i wish i had the balls to do it’.” mowers left the governor’s office to join the trump campaign the next month. he said he heard twice after that from bridget anne kelly, who was his boss at governor’s office, asking if he’d heard from sokolich again. first she called him on his cell phone on the evening of august 12. “at first, she called and we exchange pleasantries,” he said. “then she asked if mayor sokolich is definitely not endorsing.” “ok, great, that’s all i needed to know,” she replied, mowers said. on sept. 9, two local access lanes to the george washington bridge were closed, causing major traffic jams in fort lee. it was that day that kelly sent mowers a message asking again about sokolich and whether they had spoken. he said they had not. kelly, who was a deputy chief of staff to the governor, and bill baroni, who was the deputy executive director of the port authority of new york and new jersey, are accused of closing access lanes to the bridge to punish sokolich for refusing to endorse christie. the port controls the bridge. they allegedly worked with david wildstein, who was the director of interstate capital projects for the bi-state agency. he had already pleaded guilty and plans to testify against both defendants this afternoon. christie, who is currently a top adviser to trump, has denied any knowledge or involvement in the lane-closing incident. but prosecutors said on monday the governor was told of the traffic gridlock on the third day of the lane closings. baroni and kelly, both 44, were indicted last may on charges of conspiracy, fraud and civil rights violations.      new jersey at bridgegate trial, trump aide describes how christie's office tracked endorsements      
__label__0 the white house would prefer to avoid a government shutdown, but “it’s not at all clear” that president barack obama would sign the continuing resolution put forward thursday by republicans to fund the government through dec. 9, an administration spokesman cautioned friday. white house press secretary josh earnest on friday raised the possibility of obama vetoing the legislation senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) proposed thursday, warning republicans that the measure's lack of money for addressing flint, michigan’s lead crisis — and its failure to include a change to campaign finance disclosure law that democrats want — raises serious concerns for the president. story continued below “you know, one of the reasons i was a little late in joining you all today is i had an opportunity to talk with the president in the oval office about this proposal, and after that conversation it’s not at all clear to me that he is prepared to sign this bill because he believes that congress has got some work to do,” earnest told reporters friday at the daily press briefing. “and hopefully they’ll get to work on that and get it done without putting the american people and the american economy through another cliffhanger related to a government shutdown.” speaking from the senate floor thursday, mcconnell praised what he called a “clean continuing resolution” as “many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle.” congress has until next friday to pass legislation to head off a government shutdown. “it’s a fair proposal that funds all current government operations through dec. 9, while also providing funding for the new legislation we’ve just passed overwhelmingly and that the president has signed — that’s legislation to address the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic and the tsca bill.,” mcconnell said. according to the white house, though, it falls short of expectations. earnest said mcconnell’s proposal does include “some attractive elements,” such as the fact that it would keep the government funded for a few additional weeks and help fund a response to the zika crisis. “we were, however, disappointed that for — that congress has not made a commitment to addressing the situation in flint,” earnest said, adding that while many democrats are advocating for such, not enough republicans are following suit. “and the president is concerned that that situation has not been addressed in the context of these ongoing negotiations. so he’s concerned about that.” “the president’s also concerned about the fact that the proposal includes a rider that would essentially protect the ability of special interests to funnel money into political campaigns without having to disclose it,” earnest continued. “that’s — first of all, i don’t really know what a proposal like that’s doing in a budget bill, setting aside the fact that transparency in government and transparency in politics is something that is worthy of bipartisan support.”      white house raises possibility of budget bill veto

pm cet iceland, the country, is considering legal action against iceland, the british supermarket chain, over the use of its name, according to u.k. media. the icelandic foreign ministry said it doesn’t want the retailer to give up its brand, but wants to make sure it does not stand in the way of icelandic firms that want to register the name “iceland” in the eu, the independent reports friday. a spokesman for the foreign ministry said legal action was “being looked into.” “we are looking for a ‘live and let live’ outcome,” said jon asbergsson, managing director of promote iceland, an agency linked to the icelandic foreign ministry. iceland foods, which has 800 stores across britain, has been in business since 1970. “we are not aware that our use of the iceland name has ever caused any confusion with iceland the country,” a spokesperson for the chain said. “we didn’t make any objections in the beginning, as we were never going to be running any supermarkets,” asbergsson said. “but over the course of the years they have been registering the name in several other categories and companies that have iceland in the name.”  © 2016 politico sprl log in to access content and

__label__0 hillary clinton called on authorities in charlotte, north carolina, on friday to release the police video showing shooting of keith scott "without delay." the former of secretary of state, who made reforming the criminal justice system an early centerpiece of her campaign, wrote that "we must ensure justice & work to bridge divides." the post was signed with her initial, h, indicating that the post was written personally by clinton. story continued below cell phone video showing the shooting released friday by nbc news and the new york times does not conclusively show whether the victim was armed when police officers shot him. the video, recorded by scott’s wife rakeyia scott, does not show him being shot although the sound of gunshots is audible. keith scott is not clearly visible in the video until after he has been shot, when officers surround his body lying on the pavement. charlotte police said keith scott was holding a gun when officers shot him outside of his apartment on tuesday. in the video, released by the victim’s family, police officers are heard yelling at keith scott to “drop the gun” while his wife shouts “he has no weapon” and “he has no gun.” attorneys for the family have said that keith scott was not holding a gun when he was shot, although police have said they recovered a firearm and photos from the scene appear to show one lying next to the victim’s body. the video offers a different perspective from the dashboard camera and body camera footage that also captured the shooting but has not yet been released. charlotte-mecklenburg police chief kerr putney said thursday that he did not plan to release his department’s video of the shooting, although he has allowed the victim’s family and attorneys to view it. keith scott’s shooting by police, along with that of another black man, terence crutcher, in tulsa, oklahoma, has prompted demonstrations nationwide. in charlotte, those protests grew violent wednesday night into thursday morning, prompting north carolina gov. pat mccrory to declare a state of emergency. with national guard troops looking on and a midnight curfew in effect, protests thursday night were mostly peaceful.      clinton demands charlotte police video release 'without delay'      
__label__0 incumbent senators have healthy leads over their challengers in iowa, colorado and georgia, according to a trio of quinnipiac university polls of likely voters released friday afternoon. iowa sen. chuck grassley has an 11-point advantage over former lt. gov. patty judge, 55 percent to 43 percent. colorado sen. michael bennet leads el paso county commissioner darryl glenn by 9 points, 52 percent to 43 percent. and georgia sen. johnny isakson tops his opponent, jim barksdale, 55 percent to 34 percent. the polling results mirror the current presidential standing. democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton holds a narrow advantage over donald trump in colorado, where bennet, a democrat, also leads. trump, however, has 6- and 7-point leads over clinton in iowa and georgia, respectively. the surveys were conducted sept. 13-21. the iowa poll of 612 likely voters has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points, while the colorado and georgia surveys of 644 and 638 likely voters, respectively, both have a margin of error of 3.9 percentage points.      incumbent senators lead challengers in iowa, colorado, georgia      
__label__0 for son eric trump, donald trump will ultimately win over millennials against hillary clinton because like facebook co-founder mark zuckerberg, the republican nominee “has been an entrepreneurial guy” who became “the epitome of the american dream.” “he’s gone from nothing into a man who’s just — “ trump said friday on fox news’ “outnumbered,” as democratic strategist julie roginsky cut him off: “nothing? he got a million bucks? come on, eri c…” story continued below trump defended his statement, saying his father has “built an unbelievable empire” and has “epitomized what america’s all about: opportunity and working hard and being able to achieve your dreams and what you want to succeed, right?” “it’s no different than a zuckerberg, right?” he continued. “who went out with a great idea like a facebook and developed this idea and built it and grew it and grew it and grew it. that is achieving something, right? and i think it’s very different than a person who has been a career politician.” the 32-year-old businessman then remarked that “in all fairness” he did not “think millennials relate to policy very well because they haven't lived their lives long enough to understand so many of the issues that influence, i mean in broad stroke of issues, right?” “they obviously understand a lot of issues as it pertains to them. student debt, and this and that. but i think maybe taxes and things like that might be a little less significant than other issues,” trump said. “and so i just think there is disconnect between somebody who is constantly talking about, you know, policy and this and that and then a man who built a great company.” as the conversation shifted to the trump campaign’s social media presence, eric trump sought to contrast his father’s approach with that of the clinton operation. “we're humans that are speaking to that social media platform,” trump said of his tweets, along with those of his siblings. “hillary has 100 people who work on her social media team. my father’s has myself. i’ve got myself. i do all my social. i was tweeting as i was walking into the room. i think that’s very, very relevant. going on to call it “the difference between a robot speaking and a person speaking,” trump called it “very, very transparent” before mocking the clinton campaign’s use of “-h” in tweets to signify that the candidate herself sent it. “if you have to put h after a tweet, you're not really communicating to somebody,” trump said.      eric trump: my dad appeals to millennials because he's like mark zuckerberg      
__label__0 the white house vetoed legislation on friday that would allow saudi arabia to be sued for any alleged role in the sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks — setting up what is almost certain to be the first veto override of barack obama’s presidency. obama’s rejection of the justice against sponsors of terrorism act was well-foreshadowed; white house officials have repeatedly said obama has several objections to the measure, including concerns that u.s. officials would face retaliation in the courts by foreign governments. story continued below in a three-page veto message outlining his objections, obama again stressed those arguments and others made by his administration in recent days. particularly problematic, in obama’s view, was the possibility that courts could end up wading into terrorism issues best left to national security and foreign policy officials. “this would invite consequential decisions to be made based upon incomplete information and risk having different courts reaching different conclusions about the culpability of individual foreign governments and their role in terrorist activities directed against the united states,” obama said. that, the president added, “was neither an effective nor a coordinated way for us to respond to indications that a foreign government might have been behind a terrorist attacks.” obama again reiterated the white house’s view that the 9/11 bill could lead to retaliation — which could cause “potentially seriously financial consequences for the united states,” he warned — while arguing that the 9/11 bill “threatens to create complications in our relationships with even our closest partners.” “i have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001, who have suffered grievously,” obama said in the veto message. “i also have a deep appreciation of these families’ desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.” but he added that the legislation “would neither protect americans form terrorist attacks nor improve the effectiveness of our response to such attacks.” those arguments have rung hollow for congress, which passed the legislation unanimously through both chambers. the senate passed the measure in may, and the house followed suit earlier this month on the eve of the 15th anniversary of the terrorist attacks. the senate will move first on a veto override because the legislation, written by sens. chuck schumer (d-n.y.) and john cornyn (r-texas), originated there. unless there are objections, the override vote can be set up by unanimous consent. cornyn called not only the veto "disappointing," but also obama's "refusal to listen to the families of the victims taken from us on sept. 11." and schumer called the veto a “disappointing decision” from obama that will be “swiftly and soundly overturned in congress.” “if the saudis did nothing wrong, they should not fear this legislation. if they were culpable in 9/11, they should be held accountable,” schumer said after obama officially vetoed the bill. “the families of the victims of 9/11 deserve their day in court, and justice for those families shouldn’t be thrown overboard because of diplomatic concerns.” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) said this week his chamber will vote to override the legislation before lawmakers leave washington to campaign for reelection. mcconnell spokesman david popp reiterated that on friday, saying the chamber will take it up “as soon as practicable in this work period.” and a coalition of survivors of the 9/11 attacks, as well as the family members of the victims, released a statement saying they were “outraged and dismayed” at obama’s veto. “no matter how much the saudi lobbying and propaganda machine may argue otherwise, jasta is a narrowly drawn statute that restores longstanding legal principles that have enjoyed bipartisan support for decades,” the group, known as 9/11 families and survivors united for justice against terrorism, said. “it will deter terrorism and hold accountable those nations that support and fund it.” key backers of the legislation expect obama’s veto will be easily overridden, considering the unanimous show of support from capitol hill. still, influential national security voices such as senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker of tennessee, sen. dianne feinstein (d-calif.) and sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.) have expressed concerns about potential implications of the legislation – although those sentiments had gained little traction at the capitol because the bill has such strong support. on friday, house armed services committee chairman mac thornberry (r-texas) began circulating a "dear colleague" letter urging lawmakers to sustain obama's veto, echoing many of the administration's objections against the 9/11 bill. "my primary concern is that this bill increases the risk posed to american military and intelligence personnel, diplomats, and others serving our country around the world," thornberry wrote in the letter circulated among republican lawmakers. "many of us have long resisted any attempt to subject u.s. military, intelligence, and diplomatic personnel to criminal or civil courts around the world. these individuals who are carrying out u.s. policy must be protected. differences should be resolved between governments based on policies, not by individual litigants in the courts." top congressional leaders such as speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) and house minority leader nancy pelosi (d-calif.) have said they share concerns from the white house about jasta, as it’s been known on capitol hill. but they also say a veto override is inevitable; pelosi said thursday that the white house has not reached out to her to enlist pelosi’s help in swaying lawmakers to the administration’s side. “i think that members think that the families should have their day in court, and i think the concerns that the president has expressed are very legitimate,” pelosi said thursday. “the families think that they've addressed many of those concerns in the legislation.” the 9/11 bill was a rare point of agreement between hillary clinton and donald trump -- both new yorkers who each said they would sign the legislation if they were president. the legislation amends the foreign sovereign immunity act to prevent countries involved in terrorist attacks on u.s. soil from invoking sovereign immunity, a legal principle that shields foreign nations from legal action. jasta has long been viewed as focusing on saudi arabia’s alleged role in the terrorist attacks. the so-called “28 pages,” part of a 2002 probe that was declassified in july, included some indications that appear to suggest links between a handful of saudis in the united states and two of the 9/11 hijackers. nahal toosi contributed to this report.      obama vetoes saudi 9/11 bill      
__label__0 its prospects are far from clear, but talk about the impeachment of gov. chris christie is no longer relegated to whispers between insiders. the prosecution’s opening argument in the bridgegate case — which featured the claim that christie was told of the george washington bridge lane closures as they happened by two high ranking port authority of new york and new jersey appointees — brought the talk into the open. story continued below now democratic lawmakers who control the assembly and state senate are watching the trial carefully to see if any more revelations could warrant the attempted removal of the governor from office. “all we know are the coming attractions that were given to us by each of the attorneys during their opening statements. they’ve all told us there will be proof at the trial that he governor knew about this,” said assemblyman john wisniewski, who helped break the controversy open as the leader of a committee investigating the fort lee bridge access lane closures that tied up traffic for days. “we don’t know exactly what that proof is,” wisniewski said. “for instance, is it merely the photograph of the three of them talking before 9/11? that’s something we’ve already known about and in my opinion it’s hard to make a strong case for the photo alone that the governor knew.” a democratic assemblyman who refused to discuss impeachment publicly confirmed a friday morning nbc new york report that legislative staffers have begun researching the impeachment process. no governor in the state has been impeached before. the process would have to start in the assembly. earlier this week, the liberal group nj working families called for christie’s impeachment. assembly speaker vincent prieto, who would make the call to begin the proceedings, said through a spokesman he “won't be commenting on the trial until it's completed and all evidence has been presented.” still, even if the assembly votes by a simple majority to initiate impeachment, it would then have to be tried in the senate. removing christie from office would require a two-thirds majority there, which democrats don’t have on their own. that could be complicated by the fact that senate president stephen sweeney, under the state constitution, would not be allowed to participate in the trial — a vestige of new jersey’s pre-lieutenant governor system when the senate president was next in line for the governorship. montclair state political science professor brigid harrison, who recently penned an op-ed that upped the intensity of impeachment talk, said that her interpretation of the constitution is that the senate president would still be able to vote, though it might require some legal interpretation. the constitution states that the senate trial would be presided over by the chief justice of the state supreme court and that “the president of the senate shall not participate in the trial.” if sweeney could not vote and the remaining 23 senate democrats were in lock step in favor of impeachment, at least four republicans would have to join them to successfully remove christie from office. barring damning new evidence, it’s hard to see senate republicans going that way. the governor has had tremendous sway over the votes of gop lawmakers. only once have enough senate republicans joined democrats to vote to override christie’s veto of a piece of legislation, despite dozens of attempts. state senate republican leader tom kean jr. did not return a call seeking comment. it's also far from certain that senate democrats would vote in lock step to remove christie from office. south jersey democratic power broker george norcross, a close ally of gov. chris christie, is the political benefactor for several of them, including sweeney. other democratic senators have been staunch christie allies, and one, sandra cunningham, is a personal friend. and christie is close with essex county executive joseph divincenzo, whose deputy chief of staff is democratic state sen. teresa ruiz. democrats would also be creating a political obstacle for themselves through impeachment. christie’s popularity is mired at 26 percent, making him one of the least popular governors in the nation. he’s so disliked in new jersey that democrats are considered near shoo-ins to win the governorship in 2017. handing the governor’s office to lt. gov. kim guadagno, who is already laying the groundwork for a run in 2017, would not only give her the power of incumbency, but a potential easy way to make a fresh start while distancing herself from christie. “it’s easier to run against christie’s legacy than it would be to run against guadagno,” harrison said. monmouth university pollster patrick murray said wisniewski, who's considering a run for governor, may benefit from impeachment. but it's far from certain other hopefuls, like sweeney, would welcome it. "there’s too many gubernatorial wannabees that don’t want to deal with an impeachment and, two, an incumbent kim guadgano as their opponent," murray said. “the politics of it — there are too many people who have more to lose from that spectacle for a variety of reasons."      new jersey bridgegate trial brings christie impeachment talk into the open      
__label__0 the “he said/she said” method of reporting—in which journalists observe the profession’s convention and get at least two sides of every story—has been taking it on the chin ever since new york university journalism professor jay rosen placed it in his gunsights in 2009 and started ack-acking it with regularity. but the "he said/she said" debate didn’t move from the margins to the mainstream until last week when the new york times abandoned mechanical balance and published a page one, above-the-fold piece by michael barbaro, shredding donald trump as a pitiful serial liar and obfuscator for his latest “birther” declaration. the times piece elated critics of the "he said/she" said construct. in an atlantic piece titled “the death of ‘he said, she said’ journalism,” peter beinart pronounced barbaro’s work a journalistic sea change. trump had broken all the rules of political conduct, beinart stated, and the times had rightly ditched a few of its own. abandoning the usual journalistic etiquette, which calls for mendacious politicians to be described as committing a falsehood when what they’re actually doing is lying, the times piece dealt with trump with “astonishing bluntness,” beinart wrote, repeatedly calling trump’s birther nonsense a “lie.” trump was given no opportunity in the piece to deny the charges, which sits just fine with the "he said/she said" critics. story continued below while i consider trump to be a first-rate liar and don’t mind saying so, i’m not convinced that jettisoning the "he said/she said" blueprint is such a good idea. every politician lies. if we were to police all politicians in the news pages the way barbaro did trump, it would be entertaining. but political journalism as we know it could expire as profiles and news stories collapsed into spreadsheets grading the truth value of political utterances. isn’t that what the fact-checker columns are for? in his widely applauded critiques of "he said/she said" journalism, rosen holds that by reflexively seeking the “other side” of every public dispute and shying away from expressing the truth, the media creates a bogus symmetry between the “he said” voices in a story and the prevaricators serving up the “she said” dissent. “do users really want to be left helpless in sorting out who’s faking it more?” rosen asked, proposing that journalists put a higher premium on seeking truth and avoiding distortion. the "he said/she said" structure constitutes “one of the lowest forms of journalism in existence,” he would later remark. donald trump, the thinking goes, has gamed the "he said/she said" convention to contaminate the political debate with his lies, obfuscations and double-talk whenever the press seeks comment on an issue, a clarification of something he’s said, or a response to a point raised by his opponent, hillary clinton. this is true. in speeches and interviews, he’s expressed a broadband stream of lies, such as denying that he’s used terms like “fat pig” to describe women, insisting that he never called george w. bush a liar, claiming that he opposed the iraq war, making fallacious boasts about his acts of philanthropy, asserting that the nfl had contacted him about the debate schedule, and more, much more. but they are lies, all lies. and every time the media quotes one of trump’s “she said” lies without a correcting fact-check, it undermines the truth of the “he said” side of the debate. at least, so the thinking goes. but has journalists' practice of giving trump the right of reply, allowing him to pearl his lies with another coating of deceit really been such a disaster? one result of the straight, "he said/she said" coverage of the trump style has been his record lows in the washington post/abc news favorability poll. thanks to this coverage, many voters are able to see through trump’s “post-truth” style of politics and don’t need the news pages directly calling him a lying liar who lies every time he speaks. among his supporters, many don’t care that he mangles the facts and others take secret glee in the trickster’s campaign he’s waging for the presidency: he’s serving baloney and his supporters can’t get enough of it. as bracing and as full of truth-telling as the barbaro piece was, i hope it doesn’t embolden other news pages to abandon convention. the formula, when properly executed, forces reporters to perform due diligence in their articles. the form is even more useful for skeptical “show me” readers, who want those extra bits of evidence to help them make up their mind about a candidate or an issue. this, i realize, can be especially challenging with trump because the mouth of manhattan has made a career of taking both sides on nearly everything. he is the hermaphrodite of opinion makers—both "he said and she said"—and, like any good circus freak, that makes him too exceptional to build rules from. one reason i admire "he said/she said" journalism is that i often find myself sympathizing with the "she-said" side of the equation, and its presence assures me that the reporter is conducting something approximating an open inquiry. whenever the "she-said" component of a story goes missing, leaving only the dominant position expressed, i get the feeling i’m being fed bunk. even the holy bible gives satan a forum for his dastardly views. so why not news stories? i don’t believe a story must balance out like a chemistry equation until both sides (or multiple sides) hover in the ether in perfect equilibrium. but intellectual history informs us that the dominant positions in any field—ruling paradigms, if you don’t mind the language—have a tendency to erode over time when exposed to minority critiques. in order for thought to progress, the minority report—however seemingly misguided—must be heard. the history of science is pockmarked with paradigms that were blown away by she-saiders. early in the last century, for example, the scientific and cultural elites espoused the misguided philosophy of eugenics, which held that feeblemindedness was directly inheritable and that forced sterilization, institutionalization or lobotomization for these lessers was right and just. to oppose eugenics was to place yourself outside the established consensus, to define yourself as a crackpot, to be reduced to a "she-said" if you were lucky enough to get quoted in a news story. today, we think of the eugenicists as troglodytes. or consider the story of alfred wegener. he 1912, he proposed his plate tectonic theory much to the derision of the scientific establishment who laughed at the idea of continental drift. not until the 1960s did his ideas gain proper respect, and his critics take his place as geology’s crackpots. or take the example of australian doctor barry marshall, who conjectured in the early 1980s that bacteria and not stress was the cause of ulcers, a condition that afflicted up to 10 percent of all adults. even after marshall induced an ulcer in his own stomach by drinking a potion containing helicobacter pylori he was still derided and marginalized by the establishment. “you think, ‘it’s science; it’s got to be accepted,’” marshall told discover magazine. “but it’s not an absolute given.” by the mid-1990s, the idea finally took root, undermining the business model of thousands of gastroenterologists who treated and retreated the affliction with ineffective drugs and surgery. in 2005, marshall and a colleague were awarded the nobel prize in medicine for their helicobacter pylori work. science abounds with equally dramatic stories. obviously, the critiques of every she-saider don’t automatically end in the triumphs wegener and marshall enjoyed. but when you catalog the ruling paradigms in science and technology that have been toppled in recent years, the toppler was almost always marginalized in the early going. fracking has all but destroyed the peak oil hypothesis. the “one-size, fits all” advice on mammograms has been abandoned. our views on saturated fat, once almost holy writ, have been chucked. until 1973, the american psychiatric association classified homosexuality as a mental disorder. (all is not progress: some now argue that “homophobia” is an indicator of a disorder.) marijuana makes you mad. (today, the equally suspicious paradigm is that marijuana is good for whatever ails you.) coffee, once thought to be bad for you, turns out to be good for you, at least for now. moving over to the policy realm, the once dominant “super-predator” thesis was once supported across partisan lines. it is now discredited. remember how japan’s economy was supposed to overtake the united states’? remember how federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan said the u.s. economic system was stable? experts predicted wild inflation after quantitative easing. others posited that housing prices would never decline nationwide. and so on. the dissents of the she-saiders are generally beneficial. whether right or wrong, the dissenters have a way of increasing everybody’s knowledge. if they are wrong, as michael shermer has written, their untruths force the dominant paradigm to self-examine, and if warranted, use new evidence to improve its position. if the she-saiders are right, they advance human thought. that’s how science works, and i believe journalism should work that way, too. vaccine pioneer jonas salk summarized the predictable moves of the knee-jerk paradigm-defenders with this progression. “first,” salk writes, they say “that it can’t be true.” second phase: “well, if it’s true, it’s not very important.” third phase: “well, we’ve known it all along.” before anybody puts words in my mouth, this is not my long-winded way of saying i don’t subscribe to the global warming hypothesis. i do—but at the same time, i keep my options open. the protectors of the ruling paradigm have an intellectual responsibility to mount disciplined defense against all comers. even against crackpots. the last and best reason for supporting “he said/she said” journalism: so many readers and viewers have self-segregated by limiting their news consumption to outlets that reflect their personal views. these days, many readers get only the "he said" side of the story or just the "she said" side, remaining deliberately oblivious to the vibrant debate that might actually be going on. while i value partisan media, i also value nonpartisan news operations—like politico—that make ideas duel in their news pages. npr news director michael oreskes puts this practical spin on why his organization shies away from calling liars liars: “[i]f you present the facts calmly and without a tone of editorializing, you substantially increase the chance that people will hear you out and weigh the facts. that is why the tone of journalism matters so much. we need potential listeners and readers to believe we are presenting the facts honestly, and not to confirm our opinions.” if you’re not getting a steady diet of "she said" quotations in your news consumption, you’re at risk of starving to death. "he said/she said" keeps journalists honest, even if, on occasion, it looks like it’s only accruing to the benefit of a beast like donald trump. ****** a sumptuous meal of news, news, news. make mine extra rare, garcon. send news recipes via email to shafer.politico@gmail.com. my email alerts are breakfast. my twitter feed is lunch. and my rss feed is a stingy snack.      in defense of ‘he said/she said’ journalism      
__label__0 jill stein didn't get invited to the first presidential debate, but the green party candidate is still hoping to cause a stir. in the hours before donald trump and hillary clinton take the stage, stein and her supporters plan to hold a "let jill debate" protest and subsequent "people's debate." story continued below both events are to be held outside hofstra university in hempstead, new york, the site of monday's debate. when the debate starts at 9 p.m., stein's campaign says she will "participate live in the debate on social media." stein didn't pass the 15 percent national polling threshold to qualify for the debate, and neither did libertarian party presidential nominee gary johnson. johnson's campaign said he, along with running mate bill weld, will be new york city on debate day. the pair plan to watch the debate live and live-tweet from their twitter accounts.      jill stein plans protests outside trump-clinton debate      
__label__0 the cincinnati enquirer, which by its own admission has backed republican candidates for president “for almost a century,” is endorsing hillary clinton for president. “presidential elections should be about who’s the best candidate, not who’s the least flawed. unfortunately, that’s not the case this year,” the newspaper’s editorial board wrote in its endorsement, published friday. “our country needs calm, thoughtful leadership to deal with the challenges we face at home and abroad. we need a leader who will bring out the best in all americans, not the worst.” story continued below “that’s why there is only one choice when we elect a president in november: hillary clinton.” the enquirer is not the first newspaper to buck a long tradition of endorsing gop candidates in favor of clinton. earlier this month, the dallas morning news endorsed the former secretary of state’s white house bid, making her the first democrat that newspaper has endorsed in over 75 years. and other newspaper editorial boards, some of which have a long history of supporting republican presidential nominees, have broken for clinton in 2016. in addition to the enquirer and the morning news, the editorial boards of the new york daily news and the houston chronicle also switched to the democratic nominee this time. (the new york daily news endorsed barack obama in 2008.) the richmond times-dispatch and the new hampshire union-leader, both of which backed romney four years ago, have opted to go with libertarian nominee gary johnson instead. several swing-state newspapers that backed romney have also withheld an endorsement to this point, although some did not endorse until october in 2012. those newspapers include the arizona republic, the las vegas review-journal, pittsburgh tribune-review, the orlando sentinel, the sun-sentinel (ft. lauderdale, fla.), the columbus dispatch, the detroit news, the grand rapids press, the des moines register, the florida times-union and the wisconsin state journal. in its endorsement, the enquirer called clinton “a known commodity with a proven track record of governing.” the newspaper praised her willingness to work with republicans as a senator and her efforts to assist first responders suffering health problems resulting from the sept. 11 terrorist attacks. it also lauded her work on the children’s health insurance program as first lady and her support for lgbt rights and efforts to close the pay gap between men and women. trump, by contrast, poses a “a clear and present danger to our country,” the enquirer’s editorial board wrote, and lacks any experience in governance and foreign policy. that so many military and national security have refused to back the gop nominee “speaks volumes” about what type of president he would be, the newspaper said. “his wild threats to blow iranian ships out of the water if they make rude gestures at u.s. ships is just the type of reckless, cowboy diplomacy americans should fear from a trump presidency,” the newspaper’s endorsement said. “do we really want someone in charge of our military and nuclear codes who has an impulse control problem?” the enquirer’s endorsement of clinton was not without reservation, however. while it complimented her as a “competent secretary of state,” it also said “mistakes were made in benghazi, and it was tragic that four americans lost their lives in the 2012 terror attacks on the u.s. consulate there.” but the newspaper dismissed the concerns that many republicans have about clinton’s involvement, or lack thereof, in the attack: “the incident was never the diabolical conspiracy that republicans wanted us to believe, and clinton was absolved of blame after lengthy investigations.” clinton’s “refusal to acknowledge her poor judgment in using a private email server and mishandling classified information is troubling,” the newspaper wrote, as is her “lack of transparency,” evidenced by her recently-snapped streak of 275 days without holding a press conference. but the enquirer was far more damning of trump, who the newspaper slammed for backing the so-called “birther” movement and feuding publicly with the parents of a muslim soldier who was killed in 2004 in iraq. trump’s private sector acumen has created jobs, the newspaper admitted, but has also sent jobs overseas and left some who did business with him unpaid. the editorial questioned if trump makes as much money as he says he does or if he has paid his fair share of taxes, questions the newspaper said have gone unanswered because the manhattan billionaire has thus far refused to release his tax returns. that trump has toned down his rhetoric is recent weeks failed to impress the editorial’s authors. “but going two weeks without saying something misogynistic, racist or xenophobic is hardly a qualification for the most important job in the world,” the editorial read. “why should anyone believe that a trump presidency would look markedly different from his offensive, erratic, stance-shifting presidential campaign?” “hillary clinton has her faults, certainly, but she has spent a lifetime working to improve the lives of americans both inside and outside of washington,” it continued. “it's time to elect the first female u.s. president – not because she's a woman, but because she's hands-down the most qualified choice.” madeline conway contributed to this report.      cincinnati enquirer bucks tradition, endorses democrat clinton      
__label__0 donald trump’s team has created a detailed analysis of hillary clinton’s debate style — including her body language and verbal tics — with the goal of helping the gop nominee exploit weaknesses during monday’s debate, according to three sources familiar with trump’s preparations. the “psychological profile,” as the analysis is being called, is based on a statistical analysis of videos from 16 years' worth of clinton’s debates, dating back to her 2000 campaign for senate in new york, according to the operatives. they said it was assembled with assistance from a political data firm called cambridge analytica that specializes in “psychographic” modeling of voters and donors, and that trump’s top advisers have been pleased with the results. story continued below the advisers believe that the profile proves that clinton has significant weaknesses and that they have identified her ‘tells’ — words, phrases or gestures she uses when she’s unsure of an answer, or is trying to deflect her way out of an uncomfortable question, according to the operatives familiar with the preparations. for example, according to one of the sources, an operative who works with the campaign, trump’s debate prep team believes that the profile proves that when "she doesn't know the answer, she says this, etc.” the goal, said the operative, is to get trump to recognize the tendencies, “so when he hears her say 'x' he knows what is going on, and can respond accordingly.” another source, who has advised trump’s aides on analytics, said that trump’s debate team is using the profile to coach the candidate on the most fruitful moments and responses to aggressively challenge clinton. “they think this psychological profile can predict how she’ll respond based on her body language and other stuff, and to tune trump in to recognize and leverage that,” the analytics operative said, though he questioned the efficacy of the technique. “it’s really wacky pseudo-science.” trump’s campaign did not respond to questions about trump’s debate preparations, the analysis or cambridge analytica’s role therein. and it’s unclear the degree to which trump is heeding advice offered by his team based on the analysis, though the new york times reported friday that trump has been watching video of clinton’s “best and worst debate moments, looking for her vulnerabilities.” but the creation and use of the analysis at least partially calls into question the widespread perception that trump’s debate preparations are unsophisticated and unstructured — especially compared to clinton’s rigorous studying and moot-court-style mock debates. clinton’s study materials reportedly also include assessments of trump’s psychology, his varying moods and recommendations for throwing him off his game. clinton communications director jennifer palmieri suggested her campaign wasn’t much worried about the trump team’s psychological analysis of clinton. “good luck,” she said friday when she was asked about this story during a pre-debate media conference call. “we all have seen [clinton] endure a lot of tough questioning over the years. we saw her endure 11 hours of tough questioning at the benghazi hearing. and donald trump may think he’s the person who’s going to be able to really get under her skin, but i doubt it.” the trump team’s psychological analysis of clinton — and cambridge analytica’s involvement in it — also is testament to the growing clout in trump’s orbit of the father-daughter duo of bob and bekah mercer. the mercer family, which has given $2 million to a pro-trump super pac that bekah mercer runs, largely owns cambridge analytica, and encouraged the trump campaign to incorporate the company’s services into its operations. the company, which is the u.s. subsidiary of the british intelligence firm scl group, specializes in building “psychographic profiles” of voters. it has been retained by a number of campaigns and committees backed by the mercers in recent years, including that of trump’s rival in the gop primary ted cruz. cruz's campaign paid the firm $5.8 million for everything from polling to digital advertising to voter and donor modeling, according to federal election commission filings, which show that the company was paid another $675,000 by a mercer-funded super pac supporting cruz. soon after cruz dropped out of the race, however, the mercers switched their support to trump, and began encouraging the campaign to use cambridge analytica. fec filings show that the trump campaign in july and august paid the company $350,000 for data management. but campaign sources say the company is providing a broad array of services to the campaign, both out of the campaign’s roughly 60-person data, digital and technology operation in san antonio and, to a lesser extent, in the campaign’s manhattan headquarters. additionally, sources familiar with the company said that its board includes trump campaign chief executive steve bannon, whose addition to the campaign was encouraged by bekah mercer. campaign sources say bannon is participating in the debate preparation sessions, as is campaign manager kellyanne conway, another mercer ally whose hiring bekah mercer encouraged. bannon and cambridge analytica declined to comment for this story, while conway and a mercer family spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. but a republican strategist who is close to the campaign said the mercers are “attempting to bring order to the campaign and debate prep.”      trump team builds 'psychological profile' of clinton for

__label__0 president barack obama hailed the timing of the opening of the national museum of african american history and culture on friday, signaling his desire for people of all stripes to visit the new museum and walk away with a better understanding of what it’s like to be black in america. “the timing of this is fascinating,” obama said during a reception at the white house. the “exceptionally good-looking group” of many friends — so many “that it feels like one of our house parties,” he quipped — applauded in agreement. story continued below “part of the reason that i am so happy the museum is opening this weekend is because it allows all of us as americans to put our current circumstances in a historical context,” obama said. “my hope is that as people are seeing what’s happened in tulsa or charlotte on television, and perhaps are less familiar with not only the history of the african-american experience but also how recent some of these challenges have been, upon visiting the museum may step back and say: ‘i understand. i sympathize. i empathize. i can see why folks might feel angry, and i wanna be part of the solution, as opposed to resisting change.’” obama’s references to tulsa, oklahoma, and charlotte, north carolina, highlight the most recent officer-involved shootings of black men that have captured the nation’s attention. officers fatally shot terence crutcher, who was unarmed and had his hands raised when he was struck, in tulsa last friday and keith lamont scott, who officers contend was armed when he was struck but concede that video doesn’t conclusively corroborate their account, in charlotte on tuesday. obama, flanked by first lady michelle obama and the museum’s director, lonnie bunch, used a sampling of letters he said he read on thursday to illustrate the divide among americans when it comes to policing and talks of racial bias. “i’d say about half of them said, ‘mr. president, why are you always against police, and why aren’t you doing enough to deal with these rioters and the violence?’” he said. “and then the other half were some black folks [who] said, ‘mr. president, why aren’t you doing something about the police, and when are we actually gonna get justice?’ and i understand the nature of that argument because this is a dialogue we’ve been having for 400 years.” a key challenge obama cited in “generating a constructive discussion about how to solve these problems” is rhetoric on tv and the radio that’s “bereft of context and ignores history.” “so people are just responding as if none of what’s represented in this museum ever happened,” obama said, “adding, “that’s true for all of us, not just some of us.” “my hope is, is that this, this complicated, difficult, sometimes harrowing but i believe ultimately triumphant story, will help us talk to each other,” he continued. “and more important, listen to each other. and even more important, see each other, and recognize the common humanity that makes america what it is.”      obama, opening african-american museum, weighs in on charlotte      
__label__0 frustration is growing within donald trump’s campaign over the republican nominee’s yawning money gap with democratic rival hillary clinton -- just as the presidential race heads into its final fall stretch. trump’s top advisers have held a series of tense conversations in recent days about how to close a fundraising hole that’s grown to over $200 million – a deficit that’s led trump to essentially cede the tv airwaves to his democratic rival. the discussions, which were relayed by more than a half-dozen sources, have veered into finger pointing, with some participants pinning the blame on the republican national committee or on steven mnuchin, trump’s national finance chairman and a newcomer to the political scene. story continued below the shortfall is putting trump at a substantial disadvantage during the remaining few weeks of the campaign, as focus shifts to the clinical – and costly -- process of bringing voters out to the polls. “between him dissing the donors in the primary and donors being more concerned about congress, as they should be, it’s a significant gap for him to close,” said former gop rep. vin weber, a prominent washington lobbyist and fundraiser. “i have to believe the clinton campaign will know how to spend their money effectively during the last 45 days.” last thursday, trump’s top brass, including mnuchin, chief operating officer eli miller, donald trump jr., son-in-law jared kushner gathered in trump tower with republican national committee chief of staff katie walsh. at one point, dallas investor gentry beach, a trump fundraiser who has long been one of donald trump jr.’s closest friends, launched into what four sources who were present described as a pointed critique of the rnc, which he said was coming up short. gentry asked why he didn’t have access to the rnc’s donor data, two of the sources said -- implying that the committee was deliberately withholding critical information. to those assembled, the critique wasn’t entirely new – for weeks, tensions between trump and the establishment-minded rnc have simmered over resources and the direction of the campaign. while some trump aides argue that the committee has been less than helpful, many within the rnc are convinced the new york businessman is waging a lackluster campaign. but kushner, a wealthy real estate executive and new york observer publisher who has taken on an increasingly influential role in the campaign, pushed back forcefully – telling beach in no uncertain terms that the dallas investor didn’t know what he was talking about. kushner, who is regularly in touch with walsh and party chairman reince priebus, argued that the committee had been proven itself to be responsive. he reserved particular praise for walsh. in an email, beach disputed the characterization of the exchange but declined to go into specifics. an rnc spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. the tensions spilled over into a monday conference call that stretched on for nearly an hour. roy bailey, a dallas insurance executive and longtime gop fundraiser who is close to former new york city mayor rudy giuliani, urged the campaign to reach out to the large number of republican donors who remain on the sidelines. at no point did bailey explicitly attack mnuchin, but three sources on the call said his critique was implicit – and clear: the campaign was failing to take the routine, obvious steps. mnuchin pushed back. yes, he’d be happy to contact still-uncommitted contributors. but the situation was complex. there were a number of major gop donors who were aligned with the establishment and simply wouldn’t give to trump, so why waste the effort? the discussion went on for a while longer, with bailey arguing that new polls showing a tightening race could get some people to open their wallets. that’s when woody johnson jumped in. by that point, the call had gone on for nearly 45 minutes, and johnson – the billionaire owner of the new york jets – had had enough. addressing bailey directly, johnson said that the best way to win over uncommitted donors was by contacting them, not sitting on conference calls. then, the jets owner abruptly hung up. bailey did not respond to a request for comment, and a johnson representative declined to discuss his role on the call. reached on friday, mnuchin disputed the notion that disagreements had cropped up. “the campaign has an amazing relationship with the rnc,” he said. “we have been operating as one unified team for the past five months and achieved amazing success in all aspects of our fundraising.” the flare-up comes at a critical juncture in the campaign, as both sides turn their attention to voter turnout. clinton has used her formidable financial advantage to significantly out-organize trump, investing seven times the amount of money on tv ads and opening up dozens more swing-state field offices than her republican opponent. fundraising reports released this week painted a stark picture: while clinton had raised $373 million to date, trump had taken in $165 million. particularly concerning for trump were revelations this week that las vegas casino mogul sheldon adelson, one of the republican party’s biggest donors, had decided to direct just $5 million toward electing the gop presidential nominee. adelson, who’d once been expected to invest as much as $100 million in trump, is instead focusing the vast majority of his political giving on down-ballot races. in the days since monday’s call, and johnson’s abrupt signoff, other members of trump’s finance circle have been stewing over bailey’s remarks. many of them believe they’ve made the best out of a bad situation, pointing out that in the face of ongoing resistance from many of the party’s top donors and lacking the infrastructure of past gop presidential nominees, they’ve managed to fund a national campaign. they also argue that the campaign has made serious strides in fundraising. next week, it will hold two high-dollar events in new york city, one which will feature ivanka trump and the other that will be hosted by trump and his vice presidential nominee, mike pence. and on tuesday, the day after the first debate, trump’s fundraisers will convene at trump tower to hold a “national call day” in hopes of winning over still-uncommitted donors. the campaign, tapping into trump’s popularity among blue collar voters, has also developed a vaunted small-dollar operation that has raised around $100 million from contributors who’ve given $200 or less. some of those helping trump raise money were quick to defend mnuchin, an ex-goldman sachs executive and former film producer who has far less political experience than his counterparts on previous presidential campaigns. they noted that trump did not hold his first major fundraiser until late may, long after when nominees typically begin their pursuit of big-dollar donors. "given the totality of circumstances and the timing of the race, steve has done a heroic job and he is one of the smartest people i have met on a campaign,” said anthony scaramucci, a wall street investor and republican fundraiser who is helping to organize next week’s national call day. “which is why he was probably smart enough to have never done this before.”      trump campaign quarrels over money woes      
__label__0 yahoo announced thursday that hackers apparently working for a foreign government stole data on at least 500 million of its users two years ago. "a copy of certain user account information was stolen from the company's network in late 2014 by what it believes is a state-sponsored actor," yahoo said in a news release. story continued below the company said it was "working closely with law enforcement on this matter." "based on the ongoing investigation, yahoo believes that information associated with at least 500 million user accounts was stolen and the investigation has found no evidence that the state-sponsored actor is currently in yahoo's network," the company added. the fbi and the department of homeland security did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment on their involvement in the investigation. compromised data included passwords and security questions. yahoo said its investigation suggested the hackers did not obtain unencrypted passwords and payment information. some of the security questions were encrypted, the company added. the company said it was contacting people whose data may have been compromised and urged users who hadn't changed their passwords since the time of the attack to do so.      yahoo says government-backed hackers stole 500 million users' data      
__label__0 president barack obama joked thursday that actor morgan freeman couldn’t make it to a white house ceremony for national medals of the arts and humanities recipients because he “undoubtedly is off playing a black president again.” “he never lets me have my moment,” the president added once the laughter subsided. story continued below obama also quipped that thursday’s medal recipients included npr host terry gross “and a whole bunch of people who terry gross has interviewed.” legendary comedy writer and director mel brooks got top billing at the ceremony, which also honored chef jose andres, jazz musician wynton marsalis and author sandra cisneros, among others. “as mel brooks once said to his writers on 'blazing saddles,' which is a great film, ‘write anything you want because we’ll never be heard from again. we will all be arrested for this movie,’” the president said in his introductory remarks. “now to be fair, mel also said, a little more eloquently, that every human being has hundreds of separate people living inside his skin and the talent of a writer is his ability to give them their separate names, identities, personalities and have them relate to other characters living within him,” obama continued. “and that i think, is [what] the arts and humanities do: they lift up our identities and make us see ourselves in each other.”      obama jokes: morgan freeman 'off playing a black president again'      
__label__0 sen. tim scott (r-s.c.) on thursday said that the release of video footage from the killing by police of keith lamont scott might ease tensions in charlotte, north carolina. “if we had a body camera on the officer, there is no question that we would have greater clarity going forward to what actually happened,” he said in an interview with cnn’s jake tapper. story continued below "i'm not a law enforcement officer, so i'm not going to pretend to understand their concept of releasing the video," scott said. "we've seen different agencies do it in different times. the release of the video can help defuse some of the tensions if the video is helpful." "the faster the information comes to the surface, the quicker we get clarity, hopefully there will be a calming influence," scott added. "but there is never a reason for violence in response to a situation. violence for violence only begets more violence. this is the wrong direction and the wrong path.” keith lamont scott was shot dead by police outside his apartment complex in charlotte, north carolina. police were pursuing an arrest warrant for another person when they encountered scott, who was african american, in his car. the charlotte police chief says scott was armed with a handgun, while his family denies it. “as far as we know, at this point in time, no, he did not own a gun,” said justin bamberg, one of the scott family’s attorneys. “our direct response is this: that is what the chief says. i haven't seen any evidence -- none of you all have seen any evidence that a gun was there. that is what people are saying,” he said when asked to respond to the chief’s statements asserting scott’s possession of a handgun. “it's my understanding that his wife saw him get shot and killed. and that's something that she will never, ever forget,” bamberg said. when asked whether the family wants the video released, he replied, “ultimately what i think the whole community here wants is the truth. and to the extent that release of the video can somehow help us reach that truth, i think that the family will ultimately support its release.” the family was supposed to address the press conference with their attorneys, but were absent due to grieving, according to bamberg. he said, “let me be very clear. this family does not agree with rioting or innocent individuals being injured or killed. but they do support citizens and their right to voice their frustration, to voice their anger.” correction: this article originally said that senator scott urged the charlotte police to release the video. he merely said that release of the video might ease tensions.      tim scott: release of charlotte video could ease tensions      
__label__0 ted cruz is in a bind when it comes to donald trump: loyalists say he should stand by his epic non-endorsement in cleveland. but republicans pushing to finally unify the party as the election tightens say it’s time for cruz to get on board. cruz hasn’t ruled out an endorsement and is still watching how trump’s campaign performs down the homestretch, an aide said. but there is a renewed urgency after his former campaign manager told reporters this week that cruz is warming to trump’s more disciplined campaign. cruz himself praised trump for backing the texas senator’s crusade to stop a handover of an internet domain overseer to international regulators. story continued below “if ted cruz wants to call himself a republican i think he should be at least a part of the team. it looks awfully self-serving for not endorsing donald trump at this time,” said sen. dan coats (r-ind.). “you’re on the same team, so you don’t sit on the bench and sulk because you didn’t get the starting job. if he wants to be called on in the future, he needs to show some character.” “it would be helpful,” said sen. roger wicker of mississippi, chairman of the senate gop’s campaign arm. “if i were in ted cruz’s position, i would have gone ahead and made the case that of the choices available, mr. trump is far and away the best.” cruz, of course, did exactly the opposite at the republican convention, drawing boos and jeers from partisans after he urged delegates to “vote your conscience.” it may have made him enemies among trump supporters, but it also endeared him to those who have flocked to cruz and his brand of “principled conservatism.” former aides said they would be crushed if cruz suddenly came around to trump after taking so much heat and refusing to back down. “if cruz's conscience didn't allow him to support trump at the convention, i don't see any evidence that trump has changed his behavior to allow cruz's conscience to support trump now,” said amanda carpenter, a former speechwriter and communications director for cruz in the senate. rick tyler, who ran cruz’s press shop during much of his presidential run, said that despite the pressure from republicans, cruz will be “done” if he endorses trump. "there is no negative future stemming from his defense of conservatism speech in cleveland,” tyler said in an email. “either trump loses and the speech is cast in a new light; or trump wins and is a terrible president and the speech is again cast in a new light; or trump wins and is a great president, serves 2 terms and everyone forgets it.” privately, some republicans interpreted former campaign manager jeff roe’s comments on wednesday at a bloomberg event as laying the groundwork for an eventual endorsement of trump. and hours later, trump joined cruz’s latest legislative effort aimed at keeping u.s. authority over internet domain names. cruz offered his appreciation on twitter for trump's support, and trump’s campaign manager kellyanne conway reciprocated with her own appreciation of cruz. cruz met privately with vice presidential nominee mike pence last week and emerged calling pence a “strong conservative.” but cruz hasn’t done much else to indicate publicly he'll be voting for trump over hillary clinton. and cruz is not alone among senate republicans: the likes of sens. mike lee of utah, ben sasse of nebraska, lindsey graham of south carolina, jeff flake of arizona,, mark kirk of illinois, and dean heller of nevada have all either declined to offer an endorsement of anyone or said outright they won’t vote for trump. but none carries the kind of political weight cruz does — not to mention the millions of followers. “mr. trump is our nominee and sen. cruz represents a big electoral state and is very popular in texas,” said texas rep. joe barton. “it certainly would be helpful, i think, for the trump campaign to have cruz’s endorsement. cruz has begun to fundraise for his colleagues and transferred $100,000 to the national republican senatorial committee, important bridges toward his colleagues in the cliquey senate. but some gop senators said cruz finds himself caught between a party he wants to lead and a faction of the gop that would never forgive him, including prominent conservatives like radio host steve deace, who said on wednesday that "if someone with cruz's moxie can't hold the line in the gop it can't be done. so just burn it down" it’s potentially a no-win situation that republicans are sympathetic to. “if you look at the position he’s in, let’s say donald trump wins: probably not good for ted cruz. donald trump loses: probably not good for ted cruz,” said a republican senator. “it’s a big liability.” moreover, cruz’s potential foe in his 2018 reelection race, rep. mike mccaul (r-texas), spent the week picking at cruz’s vulnerability on trump. he said cruz's position makes him "very angry." “what he did at the convention turned off a lot of people. he pledged to support [trump]. he broke his word,” mccaul said on the laura ingraham show. a month ago, the terrain looked different for cruz. trump was lagging behind clinton and republicans were preparing for a blowout, making cruz less culpable for blame given the widespread belief that trump himself was the problem. but now the election is close and polls show trump surging in swing states. republicans say cruz’s support could help put trump over the top and help solidify his position in states that he won in the primary like colorado, maine or wisconsin. on the other hand, a narrow trump loss could lead to finger-pointing if cruz doesn't bring on board his supporters. “i think he wants to part of the team. i think he’s very bright, i think he’s capable of really adding something to it. but he also is concerned with being principled in this particular case,” said sen. mike rounds (r-s.d.). “you walk a fine line sometimes. i’m hopeful we’ll have a united effort.”      cruz feeling the squeeze on trump endorsement      
__label__0 colorado springs, colo. — mike pence said there is too much talk of "institutional racism and institutional bias" in the wake of unrest following police shootings in tulsa, oklahoma, and charlotte, north carolina. "police officers are human beings," pence said at a pastors' roundtable at radiant church here. "and in difficult and life-threatening situations, mistakes are made and people have to be held to strict account, but we both believe that it's important that we have a president who, as the chief law enforcement officer of the united states, stands behind the men and women who serve in law enforcement." story continued below pence said that police officers are "the best of us." "we ought to set aside this talk, this talk about institutional racism and institutional bias," he said, calling such assertions "rhetoric of division." asked by bishop john brannon, who is african-american, what pence would "personally do" to heal divides in the country, pence brought up the recent shootings. "when there's any loss of life, we have to speak with compassion, we have to make it clear that there will be a thorough investigation and that justice will be served and that high standards will be upheld," pence said. pence sought to strike a tone of unity in his remarks, repeating that "there will always be more that unites us in this country than could ever divide us." at a town hall event shortly after the pastors roundtable, pence used the same line — that there is too much talk of "institutional racism" — to take aim at democratic nominee hillary clinton. "but in the wake of these tragic events in tulsa and charlotte, sadly our opponent once again refers to what she calls the institutional racism in law enforcement," pence said. "we heard this week again of the 'systemic racism' in law enforcement in this country." pence said people expect a "thorough, immediate and transparent investigation" in the wake of police shootings. pence went on to say that police are "not a force for racism in america, they are a force for good, they stand for our families, they protect our homes and they deserve our support and respect." he also said he respected protesters' constitutional right to assemble, but added "there is no right to engage in violence against our citizens or against our property." trump expressed his own concern about the tulsa shooting on wednesday, suggesting the shooting happened because the officer in question was “choking” under pressure.      pence: there's too much talk of police department 'racism'      
__label__0 donald trump has taken the lead over hillary clinton in iowa and narrowed the former secretary of state’s advantage in colorado and virginia, a new quinnipiac university poll shows. the quinnipiac poll of likely voters in the four swing states, released thursday, asked respondents about a four-way presidential race that also includes libertarian gary johnson and green party candidate jill stein. story continued below trump, who trailed clinton by 2 points in iowa in an august quinnipiac poll, now leads by 7 points, 44 percent to 37 percent. he also leads in georgia, where likely voters also preferred him by a 7-point margin, 47 percent to 40 percent. stein earned the support of 2 percent of respondents in iowa and did not register any support in georgia, while johnson polled at 10 percent and 9 percent, respectively. both the clinton campaign and priorities usa, a super pac backing the former secretary of state, stopped airing advertisements for her in both virginia and colorado over the summer amid a seemingly insurmountable polling advantage. but the fresh quinnipiac poll shows that advantage narrowed in both states. in colorado, clinton’s lead has shrunk from 8 points in mid-august to just 2 points in the most recent poll, 44 percent to 42 percent, with johnson polling at 10 percent and stein at 2 percent. clinton's lead in colorado falls within the poll’s margin of error, putting the two candidates in a statistical tie in the state. in virginia, the 9-point advantage clinton held over trump last month has shrunk to 6 points, 45 percent to 39 percent, in the poll released thursday. johnson earned the support of 8 percent of respondents from virginia while stein polled at 1 percent there. the new polls are the latest in an array of positive swing-state news for the manhattan billionaire, who has polled well in purple states of late. a fox news poll out wednesday showed trump with leads in ohio, north carolina and nevada and a suffolk university poll released earlier in the day thursday put trump narrowly ahead of clinton. the news has been better for the former secretary of state in nationwide polls. an nbc news/wall street journal poll released wednesday afternoon put clinton ahead of trump by 6 points among likely voters across the country. but even if likely voters nationwide prefer clinton, trump could still carve a path to the white house with wins in key swing states. the quinnipiac university poll was conducted from sept. 13-21 via landlines and cellphones. it reached 644 likely colorado voters and 638 georgians likely to vote, both with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.9 points. the poll also reached 612 iowans, with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4 points, and 659 likely virginia voters, with a with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.9 points.      swing-state polls: trump leads in iowa, narrows the gap in colorado and virginia      
__label__0 new york — the united states and russia ended any pretenses thursday of their cease-fire for syria remaining in force after days of increased violence and the syrian military's announcement of a new offensive in aleppo. "we can't go out to the world and say we have an agreement when we don't," secretary of state john kerry said after meeting the top diplomats from russia and more than a dozen european and middle eastern countries. story continued below kerry's statement, after three days of private and public diplomacy on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly, provided an ominous endnote to a week diplomats had hoped would be a major capstone toward peace. instead, kerry and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov, who negotiated the truce two weeks ago, went their separate ways as violence in syria flared anew and the relationship between the two key foreign powers in the conflict appeared to reach a new low. no one spoke of being able to quickly resuscitate the cease-fire. while kerry and lavrov were set to hold more talks friday, even confidence-building measures seem beyond their reach at this point. as the diplomats huddled in a new york hotel, syria's military command said it would restart operations in the northern city of aleppo, scene of some of the most bitter fighting in recent months. according to one official present in the gathering, kerry was informed of the news when his chief of staff showed him a headline on his blackberry. a furious kerry then told the entire room, lavrov included, that "even while we are meeting here, they are doing this," said the official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. lavrov told russian media that consultations would continue to "guarantee" the cease-fire. but even as kerry vowed to press on with all efforts to find a peaceful solution to the war between syrian president bashar assad's russian-backed government and u.s.-backed rebels, he acknowledged the current strategy wasn't working. "we can't be the only ones trying to hold this door open," kerry told reporters. "russia and the regime must do their part or this will have no chance." he called for the immediate grounding of planes and helicopters that have launched airstrikes, including a russian one earlier this week that the u.s. says hit an aid convoy, killing 20 civilians. russia has denied responsibility, while raising a range of ulterior scenarios for how the caravan might have been struck. "absent a major gesture like this, we don't believe there is a point to making more promises or issuing more plans or announcing something that can't be reached," kerry said, describing a "moment of truth" for syria, russia and all those trying to halt the bloodshed. the meeting came after assad told the ap in an interview in damascus that the united states was to blame for the deal's failure. he cited u.s. inability to control "terrorist" groups and a weekend attack that killed dozens of syrian soldiers. the u.s. apologized for what it described as a mistake. lavrov had sought a three-day pause in fighting to revive the cease-fire. but u.s. officials said there was no point returning to a situation in which rebels would be pressed to hold fire, while the syrian and russian military's could violate the agreement.      kerry says syrian diplomacy at impasse after truce collapses      
__label__0 north carolina republicans are lamenting the unrest gripping their state’s largest city, but, quietly, they also see it as an opportunity for donald trump to gain ground in a critical swing state. and they’re asking him to take advantage of it. story continued below “north carolina republicans are sending the word to the trump campaign that once this settles down, a visit to charlotte, to the mecklenburg police, to the sheriff and others, is something we really want to see,” said a high-ranking north carolina republican, granted anonymity to discuss political calculations during a sensitive moment for the state. “lawmakers and party officials are sending word to the trump campaign.” the crisis in charlotte was sparked by the shooting of keith lamont scott, an african-american man who police say was armed, though no video has been released and the family disputes that claim. since then, the city has been the scene of violent clashes between police and protesters, with the clashes captured on live, national television. the tumult comes as hillary clinton’s once-formidable lead in state polls has faded. a spate of polls out this week show either a tied race or give trump a slight edge—a sharp contrast from last month, when clinton was leading by anywhere from 2 to 9 percentage points. north carolina political operatives are skeptical that, unless the chaos in charlotte continues for weeks, the issue will make a substantial dent in the race. but republicans and some democrats do say that the dynamic creates an opening for trump to further shore up and energize the gop base—something he has struggled to do—predicting voters will respond to his campaign’s law-and-order message and his staunch defense of police, even amid national concerns over institutional police racism. a senior adviser to the trump campaign said only that trump had been in the state earlier this week and "we have not yet announced the date of our next trip back to the state." “i certainly think unrest feeds into trump’s narrative that ‘america’s falling apart, we need to make america great again,’” said tom jensen, a democratic pollster whose firm is based in north carolina. “my sense is, most white north carolinians who would be really repulsed by what’s going on in charlotte would be in trump’s camp. i doubt it moves the needle a lot, but the race is just about tied … something like that is never going to move the race by 3 or 4 points, but it can change the race on the margins, and we’re on the margins.” thus far, clinton has largely stuck to tweeting in support of scott, rather than commenting on the wednesday night protests. and trump was vague in a fox news appearance thursday morning, lamenting the “lack of spirit between the white and the black,” and going on to assert that amid the chaos “our country looks bad to the world” in a speech later in the day. but moving the needle even a little may be enough in a state where the polls are tight and there’s a history of thin margins. north carolina, a typically red state that went for barack obama in 2008 before swinging back to support mitt romney in 2012, is central to trump’s path to victory, which is narrower than clinton’s is. clinton’s summer leads in the state were fueled by support from african-american and college-educated voters in a state that is home to the research triangle, the raleigh-durham area where universities and high-tech companies are based. but in north carolina, as in a number of other swing states, her lead has diminished amid scrutiny of her email practices, her health and her overall commitment to transparency. and the protests, republicans say, may mean more trouble, especially if there are additional nights of strife. “every time there is a riot, protest, or general disruption of civility it helps donald trump,” said chris wilson, a republican pollster who was the director of data, analytics and digital strategy on ted cruz’s primary campaign. the cruz primary campaign had firsthand experience with this: protests at a chicago trump rally ahead of the march 15 primaries—when a list of states that included north carolina voted—dominated the weekend coverage before those races. wilson said the net effect was boosting trump across the board in the final days before the republican contests (though representatives from sen. marco rubio's campaign, also watching their own internal numbers, have said they didn’t see the same effect). “we certainly saw this in the primaries as the riots [in] chicago, prior to a scheduled trump speech, created a significant lift for trump’s candidacy,” wilson said. “not just in illinois, but also in missouri and north carolina.” the unrest also carries risks for trump, as the charged racial questions surrounding the issue heighten the possibility of a misstatement, one that could undo a recent effort to fight charges that he’s a racist candidate. that is a risk for the bombastic trump, who has a record of horrifying moderate voters in the wake of tragedies (“appreciate the congrats for being right on radical islamic terrorism,” he tweeted, following a shooting at a gay nightclub in orlando, though he said he didn’t want the “congrats”). and the charlotte situation carries opportunities for clinton as well. african-americans, a crucial part of her base, have been outraged by the shooting, the latest instance of a black man dying in an altercation with police (in this instance, the police officer involved was also african-american). clinton has been a champion of “mothers of the movement,” a group of african-american mothers whose children died primarily in incidents involving law enforcement, and she is a vocal proponent of criminal justice reform. in north carolina and nationally, her campaign is engaged in extensive outreach to the african-american community. a senior democratic operative working in north carolina said the incidents unfolding in charlotte underscore the risks african-americans see in a potential president trump. “it is further alienation, a further concern among african-american voters about trump’s presidency,” the source said, noting that trump has a long record of making incendiary comments about minorities. the strategist said trump’s best-case scenario, politically, is that calls for law and order help him solidify his base—but that doesn’t move the dial with independent and more moderate voters, the source insisted. “i think donald trump continues to solidify his 43 percent of the vote, he’s not adding votes, he’s certainly alienating others,” the democrat said, going on to add, “it just confirms to his base all the things they’re concerned about are real. but shoring up 43 percent of the vote you have is not the way to get to 50.” and carter wrenn, a longtime republican strategist, said it is not a given that trump’s standing will rise on the other side of the aisle just because of the protests. “if you’re living in north carolina, you turn on the tv and there’s riots in charlotte, there’s looting, it gets your attention, but it doesn’t automatically help one candidate over another,” he said. “it depends on how the individual candidate responds. people will watch that. if they think, ‘gosh, trump’s got a lot of judgment, he knows how to solve this,' it will help him. if they think, ‘old trump just poured gas on the fire,’ it won’t help him at all.”      republicans see new hope for trump in north carolina      
__label__0 the obama administration on thursday terminated the federal recognition of the nation’s largest accreditor of for-profit colleges — a rare move that could ultimately jeopardize the ability of hundreds of schools to access federal student aid. the decision against the accrediting council for independent colleges and schools, which is likely to be appealed, was based on education department findings that the organization failed to properly monitor and discipline the colleges it oversees. story continued below acics will now have 30 days to file an appeal directly to education secretary john b. king jr., who on wednesday pledged to resolve such an appeal “quickly.”      education department terminates federal recognition of for-profit college accreditor      
__label__0 donald trump's campaign isn't alone in patronizing his own businesses: taxpayers are indirectly doing so, too. federal election commission records show that the u.s. secret service has paid the trump campaign about $1.6 million to cover the cost of flying its agents with the candidate on a plane owned and operated by one of his companies. story continued below it’s standard practice for the agency — which is tasked with protecting presidential candidates as well as presidents and other federal officials — to reimburse presidential campaigns for the cost of traveling with the candidates. in fact, the secret service has reimbursed the clinton campaign, too: $2.6 million so far this cycle. the difference with trump is that one of his companies, tag air, inc., owns the plane, so the government is effectively paying him. the clinton campaign, by contrast, mostly has been chartering planes from a private company called executive fliteways in which the clintons do not have any ownership interest. “the taxpayers are actually reimbursing trump for the travel of the secret service agents," said brett kappel, a campaign finance lawyer at the law firm akerman llp. "it's just another example of how the trump campaign has taken an unprecedentedly large amount of its money and spent it at trump-owned facilities." trump campaign spokeswoman hope hicks responded to questions about the secret service payments by saying “everything was done in accordance with fec guidelines and regulations. please direct further questions to usss.” secret service spokeswoman nicole mainor said the fec “specifically requires security personnel such as the secret service to reimburse campaigns for seats” on charter aircraft. a politico analysis of fec records found that, through the end of august, trump’s campaign has spent at least $8.2 million at trump's own businesses, including to hold events at his hotels, buy food from his restaurants and rent office space for its headquarters in his manhattan office tower. but the biggest chunk of the expenses, almost $6 million, were to tag air, inc. trump, who once said “i could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it,” has attracted criticism for mixing business and politics to an unprecedented degree. he has made a point of highlighting his properties on the campaign trail, leading opponents to accuse him of using his presidential bid to promote his brand and line his pockets. the campaign in a statement on thursday rejected that criticism as “misleading and flat out wrong,” pointing out that the amount the campaign spent at trump's businesses is far less than the $54 million of his own money that trump has pumped into the campaign. the statement explained the campaign’s payments to tag air and other trump-owned companies by saying “the campaign has used known quantities as far as event space, air travel and accommodations, and has fulfilled all fec requirements throughout the campaign.” the government's practice of reimbursing campaigns for costs incurred by their secret service details dates from an era when campaigns were lower-budget affairs, the logic being candidates shouldn't have to use their own resources on required security, according to craig engle, a political lawyer at arent fox who helped draft the provision as a staffer at the federal election commission. "it's basically just calling it even," engle said. "it's either trump making a contribution to the u.s. government, or the u.s. government reimburses the trump campaign for its expenses." the same rationale applies to journalists who travel with the presidential candidates. the journalists or their employers reimburse the campaigns for travel costs. so it’s conceivable that media outlets might end up paying the trump campaign for the cost of staying in a trump-owned hotel or flying on a trump-owned plane. the secret service could also end up paying trump's hotels to put up his agents when the candidate stays there. but those expenses don't appear in fec reports because the government pays them directly. the agency paid the trump campaign an additional $724,000 for air travel that was refunded, according to the fec reports, which do not offer an explanation for the refund. of course, trump also travels on the campaign trail with his own robust private security detail. in august, trump’s campaign spent $232,800 on security-related costs, including payments to private companies such as xmark llc, black tie protection services and ks global group, as well as local police in places he visited.      trump received $1.6 million from secret service      
__label__0 eric ueland, a veteran republican capitol hill aide and top staffer on the senate budget committee, is advising donald trump's presidential transition team, according to three sources. ueland is the republican staff director on the budget committee, a position he has held since 2013, when he was hired by sen. jeff sessions, then the panel's ranking member. ueland stayed on as staff director when sen. mike enzi became chairman of the committee in 2015. story continued below sessions has emerged as an influential figure in trump's universe, with several former sessions aides taking prominent positions in trump's transition and campaign. before returning to capitol hill in 2013, ueland was a vice president at the duberstein group. he was previously a top staffer for former sens. don nickles and bill frist. ueland and the trump campaign declined to comment. the trump transition, which is being led by new jersey gov. chris christie, is rapidly expanding its pool of policy advisers, with sources telling politico it is setting up a series of policy-specific teams on issues like financial services, taxes and energy. the clinton and trump transition must also begin preparing a budget, which would be submitted to congress soon after the next president takes office. while it's unclear exactly what role ueland is playing on the trump transition, his budget expertise is seen as an asset for trump's team.      sources: top gop budget aide working on trump transition team      
__label__0 president barack obama has never had a great relationship with saudi arabia. now, he’s the last man standing between the wealthy desert kingdom and billions of dollars in potential liabilities. story continued below obama has cast the saudis as "so-called" allies; bemoaned the terrorist-inspiring version of islam they practice; and even suggested the oil-rich arab state learn to "share" the middle east with rival iran. the saudis, meanwhile, consider obama naive, sparring with him over the iran nuclear deal and questioning his hands-off approach to syria’s bloody civil war. despite these differences, obama has promised to veto a bill that congress passed unanimously allowing families of 9/11 victims to sue saudi arabia over alleged links to the 2001 terrorist attacks. that obama and riyadh find themselves on the same side against congress underscores the bizarre evolution of u.s.-saudi ties over the past eight years. an alliance once unquestioned in washington now faces an extraordinary level of criticism, but the two countries still need each other enough that a breakup is simply not in the cards. "this is clearly a relationship in transition," said jon alterman, an analyst with the center for strategic and international studies. "nobody really has a sense of what they’re trying to transition it to." just how tricky is the relationship? two more examples: obama is supporting the saudis in their fight against iran-backed rebels in yemen, even though u.s. officials worry the fight there is distracting from the more important battle against the islamic state. and many of the same u.s. lawmakers happy to make it easier to sue the saudis just this week green-lit a $1.15 billion arms sale to the country. "does no one sense the irony?” asked republican sen. rand paul of kentucky, one of a handful of lawmakers who tried to block the weapons deal in the senate. the back and forth in washington is "schizophrenic behavior" that has deeply frustrated leaders in the middle east for years, said a former senior u.s. official deeply familiar with the arab world. congress passed the lawsuit bill under intense pressure from families of victims and just ahead of the 15th anniversary of the sept. 11 attacks. the saudis, through direct contacts as well as a powerful set of lobbyists, have tried hard to stop it, waging a major pr effort that included releasing a white paper detailing the kingdom's efforts to stop terrorists. the saudis deny any government role in the attacks and note that the u.s. has never found proof of it, either. the saudis also have warned they will sell off billions of dollars in u.s. assets to protect themselves against lawsuits. administration officials downplay the idea that obama will veto the bill merely to protect saudi arabia. normally, u.s. citizens aren't allowed to sue foreign governments under the concept of sovereign immunity. obama's concern, officials say, thus goes well beyond the saudis; he's worried that the bill erodes the sovereign immunity principle and could lead other countries to allow the u.s. to be sued over its actions abroad. "to pass a piece of legislation that would open up our diplomats and our service members and even american businesses to potential lawsuits in courts all around the world is foolish," white house spokesman josh earnest said in a recent press briefing. the perception in many quarters, however, is that obama is coming to the aid of a country with much to hide. fifteen of the 19 hijackers on sept. 11, 2001, were saudi nationals. and the recent declassification of roughly 30 pages from a 2002 congressional probe into the 9/11 attacks raised more questions about saudi government ties to islamist extremists. "we are disappointed that the president is not standing with us," said mindy kleinberg, who lost her husband in the attacks and was meeting with lawmakers thursday to push for a veto override. "we have been waiting a very long time for justice, and we feel that this bill will go a long way toward accountability." whatever his motivation, obama's decision to veto the bill is unlikely to do much to ease saudi suspicions. the saudis' wariness of obama has its roots in his comments in 2002, well before he ran for president, referring to the monarchy in riyadh as a so-called ally. it grew after obama sided against egyptian strongman hosni mubarak during the 2011 arab spring movements, leading saudi royals to question whether america would have their backs in a domestic political crisis of their own. it deepened in 2013, after obama decided not to stage a military strike against syrian president bashar assad, who is despised by the saudis, even after assad apparently crossed obama's "red line" by using chemical weapons. and it reached a new peak in 2015 after obama struck a nuclear deal with iran, a shiite theocracy that sunni-majority saudi arabia views as a growing threat in the middle east. still, obama, cognizant of the need for the u.s. to maintain alliances with stable countries in the middle east, has otherwise tried hard to allay saudi concerns. he cut short a trip to india to rush to see the newly crowned saudi king, salman, in january 2015, after the previous monarch died. he also has pushed for new weapons and other security agreements with the saudis, in part to assuage saudi concerns about the iran nuclear deal. but earlier this year, in comments to the atlantic magazine that infuriated the saudis, obama appeared to reverse decades of u.s. policy that tilted heavily toward riyadh and against tehran. “the competition between the saudis and the iranians — which has helped to feed proxy wars and chaos in syria and iraq and yemen — requires us to say to our friends as well as to the iranians that they need to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace,” obama said. prince turki al-faisal, the former head of saudi intelligence, wrote in an extraordinary open letter soon afterward that obama had "thrown us a curve ball" and criticizing the president for saying america’s gulf allies were “free riders” wholly dependent on the u.s. for their security. and in april, weeks after the atlantic piece was published, saudi arabia appeared to snub obama when he visited riyadh for a summit by sending a lower-level official to greet him at the airport and not broadcasting his arrival on state tv. the readouts from those meetings in riyadh also suggested the president hadn't done much to assuage saudi concerns, with the two sides saying they'd "discussed" and "exchanged views" more than agreeing on anything. the president also hosted saudi arabia’s deputy crown prince, mohammed bin salman, when he visited washington this summer on a trip aimed at improving the kingdom’s image in washington. obama made sure to praise the prince's plan to transform the saudi economy, dubbed vision 2030. he also tried to reassure the saudi royal that the u.s. will back the saudis against interference by iran, which remains an official enemy of the united states. but some constants in the u.s.-saudi relationship have turned into variables, meaning that even after obama leaves office in just a few months, the alliance could prove rocky. the low price of oil, for example, is forcing the kingdom to rethink its economy; the u.s. also relies more now on its own energy reserves, reducing america’s addiction to saudi oil. some observers also point to cultural changes in deeply conservative saudi arabia — women, though still facing severe segregation, make up a growing share of the workforce; young people are more exposed than ever to the internet and the outside world; and thousands of saudis educated in the u.s. are now capitalizing on that experience in their country. by all accounts, the u.s. and saudi arabia still maintain a strong security relationship, and u.s. officials privately say the saudis are helpful partners in the fight against terrorist groups such as al qaeda, which the saudi monarchy views as a threat to its own rule. u.s. officials also say the saudis have taken steps in recent years to silence the most radical of their islamist preachers and change their school curricula to be more tolerant. "the close cooperation on countering violent extremists like [the islamic state], the continued saudi preference for american arms, the important role that saudi arabia plays in international energy markets and the $70 billion dollars worth of annual trade between the two countries are enough to sustain this relationship for the foreseeable future," said fahad nazer, a former political analyst with the saudi embassy in washington who now does similar work for jtg inc. in many ways, what obama thinks about the saudis matters less and less as his time in the oval office draws to an end. but while the saudis will be happy to see him leave, there's great uncertainty in riyadh about how the next president will deal with them. both democrat hillary clinton and republican donald trump have voiced grave concerns about saudi arabia's track record of producing islamic extremists; clinton has said she supports the 9/11 lawsuit bill. but while clinton would likely be a more predictable partner, the saudis see trump — who has called for a ban on muslims entering the united states — as a wild card. for now, however, the saudis are nervously watching congress to see exactly how unhappy lawmakers are with them. already, some members of congress are hinting that they are not comfortable with the 9/11 legislation after all, and that they may consider voting to uphold obama's veto. their hesitation comes as a growing number of foreign countries and blocs, including the european union, voice opposition to the bill. the original bill passed on voice vote in both houses, making a veto override especially sensitive because members will have to go on the record. and with the presidential election looming, the politics are even more fraught than normal. “saudi arabia has never been an especially popular actor in washington — a powerful one, but not popular," the former senior u.s. official said. "and now, nobody in congress wants to stick their neck out for the saudis two-and-a-half months before the presidential election.”      obama, in an awkward twist, becomes saudi arabia's defender

__label__0 gunfire and racially charged rioting have broken out again, this time in charlotte, offering donald trump another chance to unabashedly sell himself as the “law and order” candidate, to side with police over african-american protesters and to rally his overwhelmingly white base. but trump hasn’t quite done that. story continued below instead, the republican presidential nominee delivered a more muted response as he called into fox news thursday morning, saying “there's a lack of spirit between the white and the black.” a day earlier, while campaigning in a black neighborhood in cleveland, trump defended an unarmed black man who was shot recently — and questioned the actions of the police officer who shot him. after more than a year of running one of the most racially and ethnically divisive campaigns in decades, trump has begun to zig and zag on issues of race in the election’s final stretch. appearing with black supporters and in black neighborhoods multiple times this month, trump has sought to wash away the charges of racism that white nationalists have cheered. hillary clinton, meanwhile, has made casting trump as outside-the-mainstream — she hammered trump on the steve harvey show for “bullying and bigotry” this week — one of the cornerstones of her campaign. trump’s advisers and the candidate himself insist his concerted black outreach is a genuine effort to chip away at democrats’ overwhelmingly margin among black voters, a group with whom he is polling in the low single digits. but democrats, and even some skeptical republicans, see his new tone more as an effort to make himself palatable to uneasy white voters who might otherwise be turned off by his past rhetoric. “when he asks black voters, ‘what have you got to lose, it can’t get any worse,’ he’s really just cynically talking to white voters,” said rob stutzman, a veteran republican strategist and trump critic. naacp president cornell william brooks said, “i can't discern the intentions of mr. trump on this issue, but here's what we can say: policy without particulars on the eve of the election insults the intelligence and sensitivities of any group.” trump spoke most at length about the unfolding violence in charlotte on thursday at an energy conference in pittsburgh, describing a “very wounded country” and national leadership vacuum that he would fill. “there is no right to engage in violent disruption,” trump said, as charlotte residents have taken to the streets in violent protest of the fatal shooting of a black man there. police have fired back tear gas in intense clashes. he pitched his “law and order” approach as beneficial to black communities. “the people who will suffer most are law abiding african-american residents,” trump said. that line was in his prepared remarks distributed by his campaign. but moments later, he ad-libbed a white stereotype of black communities. “and if you’re not aware,” trump said, deviating from his teleprompter. “drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night.” these days, trump regularly tells mostly white audiences about the travesty of black neighborhoods, comparing them to war-torn places like afghanistan. in rural north carolina on tuesday, trump said that african-american communities are “absolutely in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever.” on wednesday, not long after his appearance with a cleveland church where trump questioned the police officer in oklahoma who shot an unarmed black man, terence crutcher, trump embraced a broad expansion “stop-and-frisk,” a controversial policing policy. by thursday, trump said he wasn’t backing a national policy — saying he was only referring to chicago, despite making his comment in cleveland. "we've seen an expression of empathy for the loss of mr. crutcher's life, followed by a call for the nationalization and expansion of stop-and-frisk, preceded by a call for law and order without specifying what that means,” brooks said. “his platform suffers from a multiple personality disorder. it's not consistent.” still, trump has clearly made some efforts. in pittsburgh, trump preached empathy. “we all have to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes,” he said. it was an echo of none other than clinton’s remarks after the shooting of police officers in dallas in july. “i will call for white people like myself to put ourselves in the shoes of those african-american families,” clinton said on cnn then. with all his stop-and-start black outreach, trump appears to be honing the greatest of political skills: letting different audiences hear the same words and imbue them with different meaning. “it just seems that there's a lack of spirit between the white and the black. i mean, it's a terrible thing that we're witnessing. you're seeing it, i'm seeing it. and you look at what went on last night in charlotte, a great place, and you just see it,” as he said fox news on thursday. “there's a — there's somewhat — and i see it even going out. there's such a lack of — there's a lack of spirit. there's a lack of something. something's going on that's bad. and what's going on between police and others is getting worse.” the “racist” charge has deeply irked trump’s friends and allies. bruce levell, the executive director of the national diversity coalition for trump who traveled with him in ohio this week, expressed frustration with the negative labels affixed to trump. “it’s just unfair, unfortunately, what he’s had to endure,” levell said. “i don’t believe he’s changed his tone and tenor. donald trump has been clear since day one he’s for all americans.” trump has drawn historically low support levels in polling among african-american voters, including some swing-state surveys over the summer in ohio and pennsylvania that showed him with 0 percent. he has climbed from such lows, claiming his numbers are trending upward “like a rocket ship” but he remains mired in single digits in most surveys. his approval among latinos is not much better. in a new wall street journal/nbc news, showed trump with 17 percent support among likely hispanic voters — 10 points below what mitt romney received four years ago. nearly 80 percent had negative feelings about trump. whit ayres, a gop pollster who has said republicans must do better among minority groups to compete in national elections, said he couldn’t be sure who trump’s spate of black outreach was truly targeting. “your question assumes a level of calculation that i am not sure is warranted,” ayres said. madeline conway contributed to this report.      trump muddles message to black voters

"usa today expects its columnists to provide thoughtful, reasoned contributions to the national conversation, on all platforms," bill sternberg, the editorial page editor of usa today, said in a statement to politico. "glenn reynolds’ run them down' tweet, in response to a news report about protesters in charlotte stopping traffic and surrounding vehicles, was a violation of that standard and can be interpreted as an incitement to violence. reynolds, a law professor at the university of tennessee who writes twice a week for usa today, has apologized. his column has been suspended for one month." story continued below reynolds was briefly suspended from twitter late wednesday after he sent the tweet in question. “run them down,” reynolds wrote in the tweet, which linked to a news story about demonstrators who had stopped traffic on a charlotte highway. the tweet was criticized as promoting violence against the demonstrators, who are protesting the deaths of black people at the hands of police after police in north carolina shot and killed keith lamont scott earlier this week. some of those protests have turned violent, and north carolina gov. pat mccrory called for a state of emergency wednesday night. reynolds defended his tweet on his personal blog, and he accused twitter of being “out to silence voices it disagrees with or something.” reynolds’ twitter account was reinstated under the condition that he delete the tweet, he said thursday. in a statement on usa today's website, reynolds apologized for the tweet and said that the comment had been misconstrued. "what i meant is that drivers who feel their lives are in danger from a violent mob should not stop their vehicles," he wrote. "...my tweet should have said, 'keep driving,' or 'don’t stop.'"

__label__0 police robots are all over the news. early monday morning, fbi agents and new jersey police officers used a bomb-squad robot to try to defuse the makeshift bombs found near a train station in elizabeth. (the explosives ended up detonating after police used the machine to try to cut a wire.) earlier this month, sheriff’s deputies from los angeles used a robot to disarm a violent suspect who had barricaded himself inside a berm in a southern california desert. and last friday, another robot was used to force doors open as police searched for a gunman hiding out in an amtrak train. but perhaps the most ground-breaking—and potentially unnerving—case of robot-enabled policing took place in july when officers in dallas used a robot to subdue a gunman, and ended up killing him. the man, later identified as micah x. johnson, had shot and killed police officers at a protest in the city’s downtown. his rampage left five officers dead and at least nine other people injured. the suspect fled into a local community college (not a parking structure, as had initially been reported) where he barricaded himself in an alcove at the end of a corridor. the police on his tail couldn’t approach because johnson was still firing at them periodically, and there was nowhere to take cover in the corridor. during the standoff, johnson told the officers he wanted to kill more people, and he said he had planted bombs in the area. with about 58 students and college staff still locked down inside the building—including eight people sheltering in a room on the floor below the shooter—the officers decided they could not wait johnson out. instead, they placed plastic explosives on a robot and sent it down the corridor. when it got to the alcove, they detonated the explosives, ultimately killing johnson. story continued below the news that the dallas police department had killed a suspect using a robot shocked the country. it struck many as ruthless and excessive, if not downright illegal. to many, the killing seemed like an extra-judicial execution. it has provoked new fears at a time when police across the united states are being accused of excessive use of force, especially against blacks, including recent incidents just this past week in tulsa, okla, and charlotte, n.c. for some critics, the idea of using bomb-enabled police robots to kill suspects could make matters only worse, calling to mind images of terminators run amok or military drones taking out wedding parties. it has also reignited debates about “militarized policing.” “when things get easy, they tend to get overused,” said jay stanley, an american civil liberties union policy analyst who studies the civil-liberties implications of new technologies. he is concerned that the dallas incident—which experts say is the first known case of police using a robot to deploy lethal force—could be the beginning of a slippery slope. “the kind of incident where there is a clear and present danger represents the tip of a very large pyramid,” he said. there is evidence the dallas police resorted to plastic explosives only because there were no other viable options. thor eells, chairman of the national tactical officers association, told politico that the dallas police were hoping to take johnson alive, going so far as bringing a trauma surgeon to the scene to begin treating johnson if he survived the blast. the plastic explosives were necessary, experts say, because the officers needed to make sure johnson would be incapacitated immediately (and thus unable to trigger his bombs). both tear gas and pepper spray, as painful as they are, would have left him functional, and a “flash-bang” grenade ran the risk of detonating any bombs johnson might have on him. still, dallas’ robot-enabled killing raises a host of questions that the wider society is still grappling with. “does this remain something that is only used in extraordinary circumstances?” asked stanley. “or do police departments start clamoring for robots specifically designed to use force?” stanley believes armed robots could make police officers quicker to pull a trigger, an unnerving prospect at a time when civil liberties activists say too many police are still too quick to do that already. “let’s say there’s a protest, and there aren’t any police on the scene,” he said, “and a robot starts spraying pepper spray, or tear gas, or rubber bullets, on the crowd, and they do it with poor situational awareness”—the cameras on robots don’t provide the same visual acuity to their operators that a human on scene would have organically—“and they hit people who are not involved, or they do it when it’s not necessary.” swat experts push back against such fears. they point to existing laws that currently govern the situations in which law enforcement agencies may use force. “i am still legally responsible for having to explain and justify [any] level of force,” said eells. “the mechanism of how the force is delivered is irrelevant to the courts.” and unlike firearms, which are distributed to all officers, only specialized swat teams own the large, expensive robots capable of killing a person. “you’re not going to see a plethora of these things in the future,” said sid heal, president of the california association of tactical officers who, while serving in the los angeles sheriff’s department, was a national leader in assessing and pioneering new technologies. stanley counters, however, that every new technology introduces gray areas in which new kinds of abuse can seep in. he points to tasers. laws concerning use of force govern tasers the same way they govern robots or pistols. “as it happens, [tasers] are vastly overused,” stanley said. “they’re often used to get recalcitrant suspects to cooperate with the police [or] as a punishment for dissing a cop.” plus, though they were promoted as “less-than-lethal” alternatives to guns, they have nevertheless killed people. “often, the way new technologies play out on the ground is not the way you would expect,” stanley said. all of this raises questions about whether new laws are needed to govern robots and drones. some states, including oregon, virginia and wisconsin, have outright banned law enforcement agencies from arming drones. only north dakota, so far, has explicitly permitted police to put weapons on drones, though only with less-than-lethal munitions, such as tear gas, bean bags and tasers. in states with no such laws, police departments simply operate as they see fit, within the context of existing law. ryan calo, a professor at the university of washington who’s a leading expert on the intersection of robots and law, said making law enforcement agencies draft policies about how and when they can use robots and drones forces them to think through scenarios in advance. “if you want to put a taser on a drone and tase a mentally ill person,” calo said, “or if you want to follow someone around with a drone, that’s where you need to have a process in place that you’ve properly vetted with the leadership.” *** robots are not new to policing. most people are familiar with the bomb-squad versions, which have been in use for about 20 years. the large machines are maneuvered by remote control to inspect suspicious objects, and sometimes detonate them, while keeping humans out of harm’s way. what’s less well known is that swat teams are also increasingly using robots. the most common application is reconnaissance. in the middle of a standoff, where a suspect is barricaded in a room or a building, swat officers can toss small, camera-bearing devices, nicknamed “throwbots,” into a building to assess the situation. robots can be used to deliver phones to people police are negotiating with. they can be used to search a parking lot for a suspect hiding under a car—instead of having an officer lower their head and risk getting it blown off. robots have been used in more creative situations as well. in one case, a swat team used a robot to reach through a window and pull a blanket off of a suicidal person to check whether he had a weapon. (he didn’t.) in other cases, robots have swept homes for booby traps, and they’re often used to toss tear gas or pepper spray into rooms, to disable suspects before officers enter. in the california desert earlier this month, sheriff’s deputies used a robot to creep up behind the suspect and take away his rifle while he was distracted by helicopters and police officers yelling at him through loudspeakers. police argue that these kinds of robots actually help save lives. officers who are executing a search warrant in a volatile situation can send a robot in first. send in an armed human, and the situation could quickly escalate into a shooting match. send in a robot, and police can get a lay of the land and even start communicating with a suspect before putting an officer into the mix. using a robot to approach the suspect in the desert earlier this month kept everyone safe, said capt. jack ewell, head of the los angeles county sheriff department’s special enforcement division. as soon as the suspect realized his weapon was gone, he surrendered. “it prevented a potential shooting in which he could have been harmed, we could have been harmed, or a stray bullet could have been gone somewhere,” ewell said. but using a robot to kill? that’s something new. the swat experts politico spoke with said they didn’t know of a previous situation where a police department had used a robot to deploy lethal force. but they added it’s not likely we’ll suddenly see police departments regularly using robots this way. for one thing, robots like the one in dallas are expensive. most swat teams can’t afford them. the machines are large and unwieldy, weighing 400 to 800 pounds. police departments need trailers just to move them about. they aren’t particularly mobile. while they can roll down a simple corridor or street, they can’t maneuver through a building as quickly a human can. (the robot used in dallas, a remotec andros mark v-a1, weighs nearly 800 pounds, and it can go only 3.5 mph.) and while robots can be outfitted with a firearm, the robot is never going to have the same agility in handling a dynamic situation as a well-trained swat officer. we also won’t soon be seeing autonomous machines—terminator-style “killer robots” that act on their own. even the military doesn’t give its robots independent shooting power. military drones do perform certain actions on their own—like flying to a specific location or circling a target. but when it comes to pulling a trigger, the military still insists on keeping a “man in the loop.” police departments are no different. “we recognize the grave responsibility we have with making the decision to use force,” said ntoa’s eells, who is also commander of the colorado springs swat team. “there’s a tremendous reluctance to give that up.” as for the controversial kinds of drone killings that the u.s. has committed overseas, the laws governing the military use of force abroad are different from those that govern law enforcement agencies at home. “domestic law is based on the constitution,” heal said. “everything we do has to be traced back to that rock.” *** as much as anything, the public’s reaction to the dallas robot underlines the gulf between police departments and the public in their understandings of the new devices. in a news conference immediately following the standoff, police chief david brown said the department had used a “bomb robot.” the shorthand was clear to him; he meant the department had used a robot belonging to the bomb squad. but many in the public understood those words differently: that there was a robot designed to be a bomb. this, as much as anything, might be what many found so upsetting. and while it was clear to law enforcement officers across the country that the dallas swat team’s primary goal was to subdue johnson—not kill him—the lack of detail released by dallas police about the challenges it faced in apprehending johnson, especially in an age when so many people are already up in arms about police killings of black men, left many in the public with the impression that the police simply sought to execute him. even those who study this subject were left confused about the police’s objectives. “i was surprised that they did purposely kill someone with a robot,” said one expert. police departments naturally view new technologies just as additional tools that don’t fundamentally change the parameters in which they operate. the public, however, often sees new devices as potentially threatening. take seattle, for example. several years ago, the city’s police department bought two draganflyer x6 drones—essentially hand-held mini-copters—as reconnaissance tools for use during hostage standoffs and search-and-rescue operations. seattle residents, however, immediately became alarmed about the ways the devices could threaten personal privacy, and they rose up against them. the backlash might have surprised the seattle police, knowing as they did that any surveillance inside a private space would require the same kind of warrant as an inspection done in person. in the face of the outcry, however, the city’s mayor shut the program down. (the copters were gifted to the la police.) the implications, according to uw’s calo, are potentially unfortunate. “now, if a kid gets lost in a park,” he said, “the seattle police department can’t roll out their drone to find them.” in a 2012, lt. anthony martinez of the fresno police department wrote a thesis for california’s law enforcement command college that pinpointed this very problem. the paper examined how new types of robots could potentially save police lives by removing humans from scenarios in which robots could perform equally well. martinez surveyed representatives from law enforcement and civic groups about what they saw as the potential challenges. costs and legal questions certainly came up, but the top concern was society’s acceptance. take the example of a robot performing an initial house search. “from a law enforcement perspective, it seems like a no-brainer,” martinez said, because you’re reducing the chance an officer will get hurt. “but if you flip that around, people might not be ready to have a robot come into their house and tell them what to do.” in order to get the public to accept the use of robots, martinez wrote in his paper, police departments first need to get the public familiar with them. that makes the dallas operation a potential game-changer. now that the public has seen a robot deploy force, previous institutional reluctance to use the devices this way might start to break down. “public perception is an important part of this,” heal said. commanders who before might have been reluctant to authorize the use of force by a robot, he said, “now see that their careers are survivable.” the fact that we might see novel uses of robots in critical situations is why the aclu’s jay stanley thinks there needs to be more discussion of what communities are willing to accept, especially in today’s incendiary environment. “this has started a whole new conversation,” he said. “it’s worth pausing to think about what it means for us as a society.”      is police use of force about to get worse—with robots?      
__label__0 hillary clinton offered her assistance to charlotte officials thursday following two days of protests and violence in the city, urging the community to "come together to stop the violence." according to a pool report readout of phone conversations between clinton, charlotte mayor jennifer roberts and north carolina rep. alma adams, the democratic nominee emphasized the importance of restoring "the bonds of trust between police officers and the communities they serve." story continued below during the call, clinton stressed that "too many black americans have lost their lives and too many feel that their lives are disposable." the former secretary of state made similar comments two days prior when she lamented the “horrible” shooting death of an unarmed black man in tulsa, oklahoma, last friday, adding that it is “just unbearable and needs to be intolerable." the democratic nominee also called for unity in a time of turbulence. "they discussed the steps we must take to ensure that everyone is respected by the law, and everyone has respect for the law," according to the readout. "there are good, honorable police officers serving their communities across our country, and we must all work together to mend the wounds that exist and build the america we want our children and grandchildren to grow up in," the readout adds. mayor roberts later praised clinton's initiative in reaching out to local officials during an interview on cnn, quipping that the former secretary of state had visited the city so often during the campaign that "it could almost be a second home to her." "she did lend her support to the city," roberts said. "she understands that big cities has challenges and she wanted me to know that if there's anything she could do to help, that she would be happy to do that." roberts said she was not aware plans by either clinton or trump's campaign to visit charlotte in the coming days. charlotte has seen two days of protests and violence following the shooting death of keith lamont scott, an african-american man who was pulled over by police officer brentley vinson tuesday. twelve officers were injured on the first night of protests tuesday, while another disputed shooting wednesday night left a protester in critical condition. that protester died thursday. forty four arrests have been made. north carolina gov. pat mccrocry called for a state of emergency in charlotte late wednesday as clashes between police officers and protesters escalated. "these police officers are showing a tremendous amount of courage and there's obviously a few hundred people who have come to our town center in charlotte, north carolina, which is a great city in and their major goal seems to be destruction and harm and that's wrong and it's unacceptable," mccrory said on cnn shortly after making the announcement. "we cannot tolerate violence or tolerate the destruction of property and will not tolerate the attacks towards our police officers occurring right now and i feel very strongly about that right now," he added. "that is not the american way."      clinton stresses 'bonds of trust' in calls with charlotte officials      
__label__0 north carolina gop rep. robert pittenger said protesters in charlotte are motivated by racism rather than anger over the fatal police shooting of keith scott, an african-american man. "the grievance in their mind is the animus, the anger," pittenger said during an interview with the bbc. "they hate white people because white people are successful and they're not." story continued below pittenger -- who is under investigation by the fbi and irs over his ties to his former real-estate firm -- insisted that the "welfare state" has turned american citizens into slaves. "we have spent trillions of dollars on welfare, where we put people in bondage so they can't be all that they're capable of being," pittenger added. "america is a country of opportunity, of freedom, of liberty. it didn't become that way because of a great government that provided everything for everyone." when asked later about the comments, pittenger's office sent a statement apologizing for the incident. “what is taking place in my hometown right now breaks my heart," pittenger said in a statement. "my anguish led me to respond to a reporter’s question in a way that i regret. the answer doesn’t reflect who i am. i was quoting statements made by angry protestors last night on national tv. my intent was to discuss the lack of economic mobility for african-americans because of failed policies. i apologize to those i offended and hope we can bring peace and calm to charlotte.” scott's death has triggered several days of rioting in charlotte. republican gov. pat mccrory has declared a state of emergency and the national guard has been called in to assist local police. charlotte police officials have refused to release a videotape of scott's shooting, calling it not "definitive." after running unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 2008, pittenger was elected to congress in 2012. pittenger, 68, serves on the financial services committee. -- cristiano lima contributed to this report.      north carolina lawmaker: charlotte protesters 'hate white people'      
__label__0 a day after autocratic egyptian leader abdel fattah al-sisi said he had “no doubt” donald trump would make a strong leader, the republican nominee returned the favor, praising sisi as a “fantastic guy.” sitting down with fox business’ lou dobbs, trump touted the “chemistry” the two politicians shared during a special meeting on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly monday. story continued below “i thought it was very productive. he’s a fantastic guy,” trump said of sisi. “i thought it was a great meeting. we met for a long time, actually. there was a good chemistry there. you know when you have good chemistry with people. there was a good feeling between us.” trump also praised the foreign leader’s handling of the egyptian coup d’etat of 2013 that removed former president mohamed morsi from power, a bloody transition that saw thousands of dissidents and protesters killed. “he took control of egypt. and he really took control of it,” trump said. days prior, trump lavished sisi with praise, expressing support for the leader’s “strong support for egypt’s war on terrorism, and how under a trump administration, the united states of america will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that egypt can count on in the days and years ahead." trump has faced heavy criticism for praising authoritarian leaders like russia’s vladimir putin. in an interview with cnn thursday, sisi expressed confidence in trump’s leadership in light of their recent meeting. asked by host erin burnett whether he shared a similar positive outlook of trump’s opponent, hillary clinton, sisi showed similar confidence. “political parties in the united states would not allow candidates to reach that level unless they are qualified to lead a country the size of the united states of america,” sisi replied.      trump praises egypt's al-sisi: 'he's a fantastic guy'      
__label__0 president barack obama on thursday stressed the need for a "thoughtful" and "peaceful" resolution in charlotte, in his first comments addressing three days of protests over the fatal police shooting of an african-american man. “the way we change the system requires to be able to reach out and engage the broader american community and that requires being peaceful, that requires being thoughtful about what are the specific reforms you're looking for,” obama told abc in an interview at the smithsonian national museum of african american history and culture. story continued below obama emphasized that while some have resorted to violence in recent days, many more are responding to tragedies "the right way." “[the] overwhelming majority of people who have been concerned about police-community relations [are] doing it the right way,” he said. “every once in a while you see folks doing it the wrong way.” the events following monday's shooting have reignited a national debate about police and race relations. after two nights of protests grew increasingly violent in charlotte, north carolina gov. pat mccrory declared a state of emergency wednesday in an attempt to ease tensions. forty-four arrests were made in that span, with numerous injuries sustained by police officers and one protester fatally wounded in a civilian shooting. obama also addressed the growing sentiment of injustice felt by many in the african-american community in the wake of another fatal shooting in tulsa, oklahoma. “i think it's important to separate out the pervasive sense of frustration among a lot of african americans about shootings of people and the sense that justice is not always color blind,” he said. according to the white house president obama has spoken over the phone to charlotte mayor jennifer roberts as well as mccrory to express his condolences and offer any further federal assistance.      obama pushes for 'peaceful' resolution in charlotte      
__label__0 a new york judge has rejected a media request to make public the contents of a 25-year-old court file on donald trump's divorce from wife ivana, saying the courts have no business deciding what information could be useful to voters. the new york times and the gannett newspaper chain filed a motion to unseal the records, arguing the move was needed to contribute to public debate over the real estate mogul and republican nominee's fitness for the presidency. story continued below manhattan supreme court justice frank nervo rejected that argument in a ruling released thursday. "were the court to make the confidential records available for journalistic, and thus public, scrutiny, it would impermissibly inject itself into the political process by making the value judgment of what information is useful in determining the present candidate's, or any other candidate's, fitness for office," nervo wrote. "the court's role in the electoral process is strictly limited to determining whether a candidate complies with the election law. the court will not take an action that exceeds that limitation." earlier this month, lawyers for both donald and ivana trump filed legal papers opposing the unsealing. the gop presidential nominee argued that new york's legislature has put divorce files off-limits in most circumstances. his ex-wife agreed, but also contended that since she is not running for office, she should not have to sacrifice her privacy even if the court found an enhanced interest in her husband's actions. her submission to the court noted published reports alleging that she claimed during the divorce that he had raped her. however, ivana trump's brief said that was not her view and dismissed those reports as "previous misinterpreted statements and allegations.” the judge agreed with ivana trump that there was no reason to intrude on her privacy. "the court is obviously aware that one of the parties, who opposes this motion, is a presidential candidate. the court is also aware that the other party, who also opposes this application, is not seeking public office," nervo wrote. "if the court were to deprive the candidate party of his rights...on the ground that there may be something in the confidential file that would be useful in determining his fitness for office, that ground does not exist in the case of his former wife, who is not a candidate." a lawyer for the news outlets, david schulz, said no immediate decision had been made about whether to appeal. "we are pleased with the court's well-reasoned decision and order," trump lawyer marc kasowitz said. nervo's conclusion that judges shouldn't try to judge information's utility to voters is not universally shared on the bench. several judges handling federal freedom of information act lawsuits seeking information about hillary clinton's tenure as secretary of state have cited the upcoming election as a reason to speed release of records held by the state department.      judge rejects new york times request to unseal trump divorce file      
__label__0 tulsa, okla. — prosecutors charged a white oklahoma police officer with first-degree manslaughter thursday, less than a week after she fatally shot an unarmed black man on a city street and just days after police released graphic videos, saying in court documents that the officer "reacted unreasonably." tulsa county district attorney steve kunzweiler charged tulsa officer betty shelby in the sept. 16 shooting death of 40-year-old terence crutcher. kunzweiler said arrangements were being made for shelby's surrender. story continued below shelby "reacted unreasonably by escalating the situation from a confrontation with mr. crutcher, who was not responding to verbal commands and was walking away from her with his hands held up, becoming emotionally involved to the point that she over reacted," according to an affidavit filed with the charge. the swift action in tulsa stood in contrast to charlotte, north carolina, where police refused under mounting pressure thursday to release video of the shooting of another black man this week and the national guard was called in to try to a head off a third night of violence. demonstrations in tulsa since crutcher's death have been consistently peaceful. dashcam and aerial footage of the shooting and its aftermath showed crutcher walking away from shelby with his arms in the air. the footage does not offer a clear view of when shelby fired the single shot that killed crutcher. her attorney has said crutcher was not following police commands and that shelby opened fire when the man began to reach into his suv window. but crutcher's family immediately discounted that claim, saying the father of four posed no threat to the officers. they also pointed to an enlarged photo from police footage that appears to show crutcher's window was rolled up. and police said crutcher did not have gun on him or in his vehicle. an affidavit filed thursday says shelby told police homicide investigators that "she was in fear for her life and thought mr. crutcher was going to kill her. when she began following mr. crutcher to the vehicle with her duty weapon drawn, she was yelling for him to stop and get on his knees repeatedly." crutcher was wearing "baggy clothes" but that shelby "was not able to see any weapons or bulges indicating a weapon was present," the affidavit states. among the definitions in oklahoma for first-degree manslaughter is a killing "perpetrated unnecessarily either while resisting an attempt by the person killed to commit a crime, or after such attempt shall have failed." if convicted, shelby could face a minimum of four years in prison. tulsa mayor dewey bartlett said police worked quickly to provide kunzweiler with the information he needed to decide whether to charge the officer. "i appreciate their efforts as well as the district attorney's usual thorough evaluation of the rules of law for which we are all accountable," bartlett said in a written statement. "these are important steps to ensure that justice and accountability prevails. "we will continue to be transparent and ensure the system carries out its responsibility to provide justice." shelby, who joined the tulsa police department in december 2011, was en route to a domestic violence call when she encountered crutcher's vehicle abandoned on a city street, straddling the center line. shelby did not activate her patrol car's dashboard camera, so no footage exists of what first happened between the two before other officers arrived. the police footage shows crutcher approaching the driver's side of the suv, then more officers walk up and crutcher appears to lower his hands and place them on the vehicle. a man inside a police helicopter overhead says: "that looks like a bad dude, too. probably on something." police sgt. dave walker has said investigators found a vial of the drug pcp in crutcher's vehicle. shelby's attorney, scott wood, has said that shelby completed drug-recognition expert training and thought crutcher was acting like he might be under the influence of pcp. attorneys for crutcher's family said the family didn't know whether drugs were found in the suv, but that even if they were, it wouldn't justify the shooting. a toxicology report could take several weeks. in the videos, the officers surround crutcher and he suddenly drops to the ground. a voice heard on police radio says: "shots fired!" the officers back away and crutcher is left unattended on the street for about two minutes before an officer puts on medical gloves and begins to attend to him. "the tragic circumstances surrounding the death of mr. crutcher are on the hearts and minds of many people in this community," kunzweiler said. "it's important to note that despite the heightened tensions felt by all, which seemingly beg for an emotional response and reaction, our community has consistently demonstrated the willingness to respect the judicial process." at least two dozen people gathered outside the courthouse after the district attorney announced the charges, with some saying they were not happy that shelby wasn't charged with first-degree murder. "we will be out here every single day until she gets murder," tulsa resident tammi sims said. earlier this year, a former volunteer deputy with the tulsa county sheriff's office was sentenced to four years in prison after he was convicted of second-degree manslaughter in the shooting death of eric harris, who was also black and unarmed.      tulsa police officer charged with first-degree manslaughter in man's death

tim mcdonagh for politico kallstadt, germany — few places in germany are as representative of the country’s heartland as kallstadt, the village in which u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump’s grandfather was born — and from which he was later deported. the hamlet of 1,200 people lies nestled among vineyard-covered hills, about an hour-and-a-half’s drive southwest of frankfurt. it has one bakery and one butcher. every year, kallstadt holds the saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy: pig’s stomach filled with pork, herbs, bratwurst and diced potatoes. trump may have captured a large swath of the american electorate with his signature blend of populism, nativism and brazenness. and yet, in the hometown of his forefather, he remains distinctly unpopular. in fact, few politicians are less popular in germany than trump. a study by the pew research center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy. since a local newspaper discovered that johannes steiniger, a member of the german parliament, was distantly related to trump, the 29-year-old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate. “with his statements about gay people and foreigners, or with the language he uses, and with his derogative statements about hillary clinton, trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him,” steiniger tells politico. trump’s rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in kallstadt. “he stands for everything that’s bad,” says sarah bühler, yelling to be heard over the 20-person brass band celebrating the saumagenkerwe in the town’s main square. bühler is a former local “wine princess,” the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry. this year, a new dish appeared in the town’s annual festival: saumagen-döner, a fusion of the local specialty with a turkish kebab. “everyone is welcome to join us here, no matter what color they are,” says bühler. “pink, purple, doesn’t matter.” tanja huber, the 24-year-old incumbent regional wine princess, nods her head in agreement. since the prospect of a trump presidency first became evident late last year, reporters have descended on kallstadt, seeking a bit of local color, a quote or two, and perhaps some hometown pride. “they don’t get that we really don’t give a damn about trump,” says huber. “he’s never been here, and he apparently doesn’t care about us, either.” *   *   * donald’s grandfather, friedrich trump, was born in kallstadt into a vintner’s family on march 14, 1869. previous generations of the trump family used variant spellings of the name, including “trump,” “dromb” and “trumpff,” according to local historians, or even “drumpf,” according to a 2000 family history by gwenda blair; but by the time friedrich was born they had settled on “trump.” germany did not yet exist as a nation; kallstadt was part of the province of palatinate in the bavarian kingdom. the region was going though rough times. unemployment was high. those who had the courage, left. friedrich’s father died when he was eight years old, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. at 16 years old, friedrich decided to follow his sister katharina, who had emigrated to the united states two years earlier. he arrived in new york on board the eider on october 19, 1885. he entered the u.s. through official channels, but he had left bavaria illegally. “both he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service,” said roland paul, the recently-retired director of the institute for palatinate regional history and folklife studies in the city of kaiserslautern. according to documents uncovered by paul, friedrich was stripped of his bavarian citizenship “as his own request” four years after arriving in the u.s. but friedrich was not done with palatinate. seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn, he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister, according to the 2000 family history by blair. five years after that, he returned once more to kallstadt, where he met 20-year-old elisabeth christ; they were engaged, and friedrich came back a third time to marry her in august 1902. but while the couple moved back to new york soon after the marriage and had a daughter, friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the u.s. and return to the land of their birth. “my grandmother said, i will marry you, but i will not go back to america with you,” donald trump’s american-born cousin john walter told german filmmaker simone wendel in 2012. friedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise. in 1904, he applied for permission to travel to kallstadt. and although he claimed in his application that he intended “to return to the united states within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein,” he took all his savings from the u.s. with him, according to blair’s family history. back in kallstadt, friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back. but though he secured the support of local authorities, the district government put a halt to his plans. on february 27, 1905, a deportation notice was sent to the town office of kallstadt declaring that friedrich was “to be told he has to leave bavarian state territory by may 1 of this year, at the latest.” also on politico matthew karnitschnig friedrich was able to obtain a three-month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill. but eventually, he and his wife — pregnant once more — had no choice but to board the ship pennsylvania on july 1, 1905, and return to new york. shortly after that, donald’s father, fred trump junior, was born. “[the authorities] said, ‘you are not a german citizen, you gave up your citizenship, you have to leave,” says walter. “so they left and they went back to america, and that’s why donald and i are here.” friedrich — now named frederick — died in may 1918 of the spanish flu. his widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited kallstadt many times during her life. *   *   * in february 2012, simone wendel, the german filmmaker from kallstadt, was given an audience with donald trump. roughly two years earlier, she had begun work on “kings of kallstadt,” a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown: donald trump and henry john heinz, the inventor of heinz ketchup. for months, wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with trump, but his office had not replied to her letters. she was only able to secure a visit with the help of walter, trump’s cousin, who had visited kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history. on the day of her visit, wendel stood nervously next to walter in a conference room on one of trump tower’s top floors. she had brought a linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw-on tops. her plan was to sit down with walter and trump for coffee and cake, the traditional afternoon snack in her home region. but when she asked trump’s staff to make some coffee, the only reaction she got was irritated faces. “his assistant just couldn’t be bothered,” she says. “hello, john,” trump said, when he entered the room, shaking his cousin’s hand and looking confused at wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her. trump sat down in front of a one-meter-long model of his boeing 757-200 airliner and a panoramic window overlooking new york’s central park. wendel, trying to remedy the situation, pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it. “afterwards, i just kept on thinking, ‘what on earth did i do?’” she says. “the cake looks really good,” trump said, and he and wendel ended up talking for almost an hour. until 1990, trump still claimed his family was swedish, a version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the anti-german sentiment in the u.s. during the two world wars. but by the time wendel visited, he had become proud of his german roots. “they grow them well in kallstadt,” he told her during their meeting. “they grow them very well. believe me. it’s good stock.” “wow, it’s beautiful,” trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born, an inconspicuous one-story building with a gable roof. “that’s fantastic. see how well-maintained it is? everything is perfectly maintained. it’s great.” when their interview was over, walter took wendel on a tour of trump tower. on one of the floors, they ran into trump’s son, eric trump. “have you ever heard the word kallstadt?” wendel asked him. “kallstadt?” trump junior replied, “no, what is it?”    © 2016 politico sprl log in to access content and manage your profile. if you do not have a

__label__0 the obama administration on thursday terminated the federal recognition of the nation's largest accreditor of for-profit colleges — a rare move that could ultimately jeopardize the ability of hundreds of schools to access federal funding. the decision against the accrediting council for independent colleges and schools amounts to what is effectively a death penalty. the sanction had been sought by prominent critics of for-profit colleges like sen. elizabeth warren, who on thursday called the accreditor a "negligent" organization that had "rubber-stamped shady institutions" for years. story continued below the accreditor's seal of approval had allowed billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded pell grants and federal loans to flow to the now-defunct corinthian colleges chain of schools, which shut down last year amid allegations that it lured in prospective students using false, inflated job placement rates. acics was also the accreditor for itt tech, another troubled for-profit college that declared bankruptcy last week. the accreditor says that about 600,000 students across the country are enrolled at colleges that it approves. acics officials on thursday pledged to appeal the decision directly to education secretary john b. king jr. — a move that would temporarily put the termination on hold. there’s no timeline for when king must act on that appeal, but earlier this week he pledged to get it “resolved quickly.” roger williams, the interim president of acics, said in a statement that the group was “disappointed” in the decision but “confident” it could show “ongoing progress” toward coming into compliance with federal rules. if the education department stands by its decision, acics-accredited colleges would have 18 months to find a new accreditor, or else their students would lose access to federal money. congress earlier this week passed legislation that allows gi bill educational benefits to continue to flow to student veterans for up to 18 months after their school’s accreditor loses its federal recognition. like other college accreditors, acics acts as a gatekeeper for federal money: last year, it allowed 243 colleges to tap into $4.76 billion worth of pell grants and federal student loans. the obama administration's termination decision was based upon earlier education department findings that acics failed to properly monitor and discipline the colleges it oversees. “acics’s track record does not inspire confidence that it can address all of the problems effectively,” wrote emma vadehra, king's chief of staff, who issued the ruling. “many of the problems identified in the staff report are serious and long-standing.” acics has been a prime target of for-profit critics and some senate democrats in recent years. sen. patty murray (d-wash.), on thursday praised the administration’s decision in a statement, saying that “far too many schools have maintained their institutional accreditation, even while defrauding and misleading students.” but rep. john kline (r-minn.) blasted the education department’s decision as “an unprecedented action that could disrupt the education of hundreds of thousands of students, particularly low-income and minority students.” the for-profit industry's trade association argued that the department’s decision is yet another example of the unfair targeting of their industry by the obama administration. "the u.s. department of education's decision today will have horrible ramifications for hundreds of thousands of students, thousands of dedicated faculty and staff, and hundreds of communities and employers that rely on institutions accredited by acics,” said steve gunderson, who leads the career education colleges and universities trade group. "no administration has politicized accreditation like the current one.” ben miller, senior director of postsecondary education at the center for american progress, authored a report criticizing the record of acics that was frequently cited by a federal panel in making its recommendation to nix the accreditor. miller praised thursday's decision, calling it a "landmark step for protecting students and taxpayers." terry hartle, senior vice president at the american council on education, said schools without any red flags can probably find a new accreditor in one year to 18 months, but it could take two years or much longer for other schools to find a new home. “it’s a major step,” hartle said. “the department has done it at least once before, but never with an accreditation agency of this size.” kimberly hefling contributed to this report.      education department issues death penalty to for-profit college accreditor      
__label__0 when donald trump looks out at the crowd during his upcoming presidential debate with hillary clinton, mark cuban plans to make sure he sees at least one unfriendly face. the bombastic billionaire who's been an outspoken critic of the republican nominee will be sitting front-row when the two opponents square off for their first televised debate at hofstra university monday, cuban revealed in a tweet thursday night. story continued below billing it as the "humbling at hofstra," cuban says he plans to watch closely as clinton tries to "overwhelm" trump. just got a front row seat to watch @hillaryclinton overwhelm @realdonaldtrump at the "humbling at hofstra" on monday. it is on ! — mark cuban (@mcuban) september 23, 2016  cuban's decision to attend the debate was lauded by clinton press secretary brian fallon, who wrote on social media early friday: "if you have ever seen [cuban] courtside at a mavs game, you know he'll be fired up for monday's debate." if you have ever seen @mcuban courtside at a mavs game, you know he'll be fired up for monday's debate. #imwithher — brian fallon (@brianefallon) september 23, 2016  cuban has blasted trump repeatedly over the course of the campaign, calling him a "jagoff" and praising him for getting "stupider before your eyes." the billionaire businessman and sports owner has also questioned trump's self-reported net-worth and mused that the real estate mogul isn't truly capable of self-funding an entire presidential campaign. the dallas mavericks owner is part of an increasingly long list of billionaires, including hewlett packard executive meg whitman and former new york city mayor michael bloomberg, who've opted to back clinton over trump.      mark cuban takes front-row seat for presidential debate      
__label__0 mesa, ariz. -- mike pence took aim at bill clinton on thursday, saying “character matters to the presidency.” "i’m old enough to remember back in the last clinton administration where america really had a debate over whether character mattered to the presidency," the republican vice presidential nominee told a few hundred people at living world bible church. "we don’t need to have that debate again. character matters to the presidency and donald trump will bring the highest level of integrity to the highest office in the land. you can count on it." story continued below pence has frequently hit democratic nominee hillary clinton for what he calls a lack of integrity, but thursday marked the first time he implicated bill clinton in the argument. he avoided his typical indictment of hillary clinton's use of private email server while secretary of state, instead focusing his attack on her husband. pence’s running mate, republican nominee donald trump, has not shown a similar reticence in attacking bill clinton over the sex scandal that led to clinton's impeachment in the house but an ultimate acquittal in the senate. "i'm so glad they kept that dress," trump said a rally in august, in reference to an infamous blue dress that implicated the former president in the affair. hillary clinton, for her part, is preparing for trump to raise the scandal in the upcoming presidential debate. trump has also gone further in attacking bill clinton, accusing the former president of rape.      pence targets bill clinton's character      
__label__0 democrats are confident the rising salience of terrorism and police shootings of african-americans this week will benefit hillary clinton. republicans, meanwhile, believe overwhelmingly that donald trump will win the terrorism argument but are less confident that he'll react in a measured way to the recent protests in north carolina. that’s according to the politico caucus — a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states. more than three-in-four democratic insiders believe clinton will benefit from the increasing prominence of both issues. and while majorities of republicans, on the other hand, think both issues will help trump, there’s less confidence that he can strike the right balance between law enforcement and the aggrieved african-american community. story continued below on terrorism and national security, the results were fell along party lines: 76 percent of democrats said clinton stands to benefit from the issue, compared to 81 percent of republicans who said it would help trump. that mirrors public polling that shows voters divided on which candidate they trust more on the issue — with a slight edge for clinton, particularly on temperament and ability to be commander-in-chief. “polls show that folks do not trust trump to have his finger on the button,” said one wisconsin democrat — who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. “that to me says it all.” a pennsylvania democrat added that trump’s criticism of military leadership for their prosecution of the overseas battle against the islamic state has alienated key voters in their state. “trump's open disrespect of the military doesn't play well among the same base he's supposed to be courting — the disaffected western [pennsylvania] voters,” the democrat said. but some democrats are concerned that rising anxieties about terrorism — if they were to persist for the next six-and-a-half weeks — could benefit trump. “we have an older electorate, plus still some conservative white democrats,” said a florida democrat. “in a close race, fear can win out.” republicans, meanwhile, said trump can effectively tie clinton to president barack obama — who, despite rising approval ratings overall, rates poorly on his handling of national security. “people who are angry and afraid feel that way because of the obama-clinton policies that created [isil] and allowed the wave of domestic terror to occur largely unchecked,” said an ohio republican. “she's counting on ‘experience’ and ‘being there in the situation room,’” said a michigan republican. “i think that works against her and solidifies that she's part of the problem.” on the other burgeoning issue this week — the police-involved shootings in tulsa, okla., and charlotte, n.c. — majorities of democrats again defaulted to their partisan leanings. but republicans were less certain the issue would help trump — only 61 percent said it would — compared to the larger majority that said it would benefit clinton, 77 percent. (reponses were filed between 5 p.m. eastern time on wednesday, prior to the beginning of a second night of rioting in charlotte, and 2 p.m. thursday.) democrats mostly said the issue allowed clinton to strengthen her appeal to minority voters — and, potentially, for trump to repel nonwhite voters further. “the voters who are young, who are people of color, and who are most sympathetic to the injustice of police shootings are more liberal, but inconsistent voters,” said a michigan democrat. “this increased attention, if it has any impact, will boost their participation, and they are more likely to vote for clinton.” added a florida democrat: “if clinton can get black turnout as a share of electorate to obama levels, in addition to her hispanic advantages, she can lose a bit of white support and win.” but some democrats worried about a backlash among white voters to the at-times-violent protests. “pictures of black youth burning things in the middle of interstate 85 in charlotte last night did nothing but help trump,” said a north carolina democrat. “with more demonstrations planned for tonight, this issue could even surpass the hb2 fiasco as the defining issue in the campaign for north carolina voters.” most republicans see the issue as an opportunity for trump to burnish his law-and-order credentials. “people believe obama has created an anti-police attitude in this country, and many will punish hillary clinton for that,” a florida republican said. and the demographic reality of the battleground states — many of them, like colorado, iowa and new hampshire have smaller african-american populations — means a backlash among white voters in those states could tilt toward trump. a colorado democrat said the african-american vote there was “small and already locked in.” “iowa is 93 percent white, and [black lives matter] protests are more galvanizing for downscale white voters than urban liberals,” said a republican there. “and those rural white voters outnumber urban liberals by a lot, many of them former working class democrats who are attracted to nationalist, anti-pc rhetoric.” “there are way more ‘blue lives’ than ‘black lives’ matter folks in iowa,” added another republican there. “trump will clean up.” but some republicans in more diverse states said the issue could motivate some members of the obama coalition who haven’t been enthusiastic about clinton. “[t]o the extent it may generate increased interest in public policy and the election in her base, that would be a good thing for her,” said a virginia republican. “hillary's base is there, but they aren't motivated or excited.” added an ohio republican: “hillary has to ignite the black community. i expect the obamas to camp out in the cities. this unrest could become a focal point for her.” and for other republicans, they questioned trump's ability to address these issues in a measured way. "trump is antagonistic and demeaning, and his ideology on racial issues/police shootings is embarrassing," said a colorado republican. a new hampshire republican put it even more sharply: "no matter how hard he tries, trump is incapable of hiding his racism." but with the demographic push-and-pull between groups concerned in equal measure about the police shootings and the subsequent protests, others saw the issue as a wash between the two candidates. “i think it helps them both equally,” said a michigan republican. “hillary needs minority turnout to go up, and this certainly helps there. trump needs disaffected, law-and-order, white voters to turn out — this helps him with that.” these are the members of the politico caucus, not all of whom participated in this special survey:

politics of terrorism      
__label__0 karen dunn is polite, precise and barely more than five feet tall -- but after barack obama’s dreadful first debate against mitt romney in 2012, she got up in the face of the leader of the free world. “you need to punch him in the mouth!” said dunn. story continued below and obama did – delivering a powerful, campaign-stabilizing performance at hofstra university on long island, the location of monday’s critical showdown between hillary clinton and donald trump, a debate that is likely to be the most watched political event in history. it’s not clear if dunn and her partner ron klain – the two most experienced debate prep specialists in democratic politics – are giving hillary clinton the same advice. but they are overseeing an orderly and intensely secretive process designed to armor a battle-scarred debater for an unpredictable face-off that presents great dangers – but also an opportunity for clinton to reverse the fall narrative of a trump surge. clinton’s team of lawyers are facing the greatest challenge of their professional lives – and that’s saying a lot, considering that klain, joe biden’s former chief of staff, was tapped by obama to solve the ebola crisis. they know that trump – a quick-study political novice participating in the first one-on-one debate of his life – is a wild card who can turn weeks of pouring over briefing books into mockery with a single, brilliant and bullying punch. “the fear is that she’ll get lost in the moment, and no one is better at seizing the moment than trump,” said a longtime adviser to both clintons. indeed, that’s what’s worrying clinton’s inner circle – that victory will come down to something like tone, which she has always struggled with, vacillating between cold and severe to thoughtful and wry. but the traditional, substantive sessions now underway are key to settling the candidate’s head, longtime aides said. "the prep matters because it gives her the confidence to know she is armed,” said one longtime clinton ally. “she will feel more comfortable if she's prepared the way she likes to prepare.” clinton, for all her knowledge, polling and top-tier coaching, has always been defined not by what she’s said on the debate stage but by how she’s dealt with what her opponents have said about her. these debate moments have represented many of the biggest pivot points in clinton’s career – from her deft parrying of rick lazio in 2000 to her collapse under obama’s fire at the disastrous nov. 2007 debate in philadelphia that demolished her frontrunner status. with clinton, a conventional politician trapped in the reality tv world of 2016, it’s all about the reaction shot – and the dunn-klain team is laboring mightily to make sure she gets it right. no secret on the clinton campaign has been more closely guarded than the identity of the person who is impersonating trump in the closed-door sessions staged at clinton’s manhattan office and at her home in chappaqua. clinton’s advisers, in conversations over the last month, have repeatedly emphasized that the mock debate session, while important, is less vital than the informal law school sessions where clinton hashes out her reactions and attacks. “it’s a moot court set-up,” said a clinton insider. “she’s doing less of the usual mock debate sessions, with 100 people standing around, this time.” another added that her preparation this year “is more style than substance. they’re trying to prepare her for the different trumps that might show up.” on saturday, the new york times reported that longtime clinton aide phillippe reines had been playing the role of trump in mock sessions. several democrats who have spoken to the participants told politico that another person playing the role of interlocutor has been campaign chairman john podesta, a sharp-tongued veteran operator known less for bluster than behind-the-curtain scheme-spinning. the buttoned-down, courtly klain has also stood in parrying questions with clinton, according to people close to the situation – but both men have been less concerned with imitating trump than preparing clinton for the substance of the attacks, two keen attorneys framing clinton’s reactions in the precise, disciplined language their lawyerly candidate thrives on. “it’s an unconventional year, and he’s an unconventional candidate, so maybe preparation doesn’t matter,” said david axelrod, a former top strategist to president obama. “but in my experience, the candidate who comes on the stage, and can anticipate the rhythm of the thing, and knows what they want to do, has a huge advantage.” insiders said clinton's debate group has tried to frame every minute on the stage as a referendum on the issue of trust -- to convince voters with doubts about clinton to contrast those concerns with how they feel about trump handling the nuclear codes. but there is still fear of the unknown that is the other half of the equation on stage with her. “you’re just not sure who is going to show up, so you have to do it, you have to assume he may be aggressive, or he may lay back,” communications director jennifer palmieri said. “that’s hard to game out.” clinton’s experience and confidence can make her an intimidating person to prep -- when you count her own three dozen on-stage debates there is arguably no one in american politics with more prime-time experience. her coaches, however, are also longtime debate aficionados -- campaign consultants joel benenson, jim margolis and mandy grunwald all sit in on prep, as does palmieri, longtime attorney bob barnett, senior policy adviser jake sullivan, podesta, occasionally bill clinton, younger policy aides who have helped compile the thick green binders of prep materials, and others. klain and dunn, who report directly to sullivan, not only offer an overarching strategy, but act as speechwriters -- line-writers, really -- paring down language and crafting practiced lines. “i have a tendency to want to give a deep dissertation on an issue or a problem,” said sen. cory booker, who dunn has prepped for senate debates. “karen knew she had to break me of the habit, but do it in a way that still allowed me to feel like i wasn’t dumbing things down. she really studied me. she already knew the language i was using out there.” like clinton, booker said he was hesitant to disgorge pre-packaged lines. but the forceful dunn pressed him, just as she goaded obama. “she didn’t call them ‘lines,’” he said. “she called them ‘moments.’” dunn has even force fed some catchphrases to the notoriously message-resistant clinton. in the primary debate in new hampshire last february, which coincided with opening weekend of the new star wars movie, dunn penned clinton’s sign-off: “thank you, good night, and may the force be with you.” clinton loves the self-education aspect of the process. but she has long despised the confrontational aspects of the mock debate dry runs, even when she’s not on the stand -- she never participated in her husband’s debate preps, a noticeable absence when she served as a top campaign adviser in every other aspect of his presidential campaigns. during a tense prep session after bernie sanders’ stunning and slim win in the mar. 8 michigan primary, for instance, clinton was so fed up with the criticisms being lobbed at her she decided to just do the job herself. when d.c. attorney bob barnett, who was playing sanders, began peppering her with attacks in a drab hotel conference room, a clearly agitated clinton shut the session down and declared, “how about i play bernie?” over the next hour or so, clinton – to the surprise of her staff – staged a credible and unvarnished version of sanders’ attacks on her economic plans and close ties to wall street, according to two people with knowledge of the exchange. for a time, sullivan took the role of the former secretary of state and framed several new responses that later became a staple of clinton’s debate routine. “it turned out to be one of the most productive sessions we had,” said a clinton ally. dunn and klain have been through the fire before – klain was responsible for the strategy that helped john kerry win his first debate against george w. bush by attacking him for not catching osama bin laden. and many of obama’s top advisers, including his wife, michelle, credit the klain-dunn team for his fall 2012 turnaround. klain, known for his minutely drafted action memos, started ginning up an attack plan for the president before the first debate in denver was even over. but it was the incongruous image of dunn surrounded by obama’s male-dominated staff that woke up the president with her “punch him in the mouth!” summons, a quote that, for many people, stuck. unlike the rest of clinton’s debate coaches, dunn and klain have day jobs. dunn, who represents uber, apple and oracle in her day job as a partner at boies, schiller & flexner lpp, is a top litigator (and also huma abedin’s personal attorney). klain works at revolution, llc, a private investment firm. but there hasn't been a democratic presidential debate without one of them involved in decades. but coaches don't play. for clinton, success against trump on monday night may have more to do with how she silently projects authority when under attack. “if trump can be positioned to bully her, that will probably be his biggest failing,” said another longtime clinton insider. “and her pushing him back politely, so there’s a difference between his level and her level, that will be her biggest strength.” in the end, it might not be anything clinton says that matters. many longtime aides credited the power of her reaction shot – a comically disapproving maternal glare honed from her years as a first lady enduring another long spiel by somebody else -- as one of her most valuable weapons in communicating gravitas and strength in the face of trump’s expected insults. if you want an insight into the attitude clinton’s aides want her to portray, check out the latest episode of “between two ferns.” clinton’s appearance on the web comedy sketch show, which posted thursday, shows the democrat at her silent best -- it was quickly hailed by critics as one of her most successful interviews, and the candidate who struggles with articulating a coherent positive message didn't even say much. she sat with a bemused expression on her face while comedian zach galifianakis lobbed the absurd at her, asking with a deadpan whether she would have to take a leave of absence from the white house if she got pregnant, and if she was "down with tpp." one of clinton's finest moments in the primary debates was her non-reaction to lincoln chafee questioning her “ethical standards” because of her email use. when asked by moderator anderson cooper if she wanted to respond, clinton smiled and shook her head. “no,” was her terse response, and the audience roared.      inside hillary clinton’s debate prep      
__label__0 it was just over a year ago, at a nationally televised debate, when donald trump chided jeb bush for speaking another language on the campaign trail. “this is a country,” trump said standing at the lectern next to bush, “where we speak english, not spanish.” the crowd at the ronald reagan presidential library applauded. ever since, trump has stayed true to his word. story continued below with 46 days until the november elections, and as early voting begins in a handful of states, trump is on the precipice of becoming the only major-party presidential candidate this century not to reach out to millions of american voters whose dominant, first or just preferred language is spanish. trump has not only failed to buy any spanish-language television or radio ads, he so far has avoided even offering a translation of his website into spanish, breaking with two decades of bipartisan tradition. “he’s not willing to give into anything that shows that he wants to cater to us,” said juan hernandez, a hispanic republican and former adviser to president george w. bush. “and he believes that he doesn’t have to. he believes he can still squeeze out a few more white, over 50 [year-old] votes.” while the majority of latino voters are english-speaking, trump’s refusal to campaign in spanish is a powerful symbol of how little heed trump has paid to america’s shifting demographics. latinos now make up about 10 percent of the national vote, with electorally potent concentrations in crucial battlegrounds such as florida, colorado, nevada and even north carolina. adolfo franco, a veteran republican strategist who served as a top hispanic surrogate for mitt romney and john mccain, said he had “a more cynical view” of trump’s studied avoidance of campaigning in spanish. “i think they’ve made a calculation that going on spanish tv in a more concentrated fashion and also placing ads in spanish would upset his base,” franco said. trump’s bid for the white house has been powered by working-class white voters and summed up by his slogan — make america great again — that appeals to a bygone era of prosperity whose disappearance is blamed on immigration and globalization. trump called illegal mexican immigrants rapists and drug-dealers in his announcement speech, and chants of “build that wall!” are among the loudest at his rallies. that has left a growing number of prominent latino republicans on the sidelines in 2016, backing hillary clinton or even libertarian gary johnson, whom hernandez has endorsed. multiple members of trump’s national hispanic advisory council resigned after his heated anti-immigrant rhetoric following his trip to mexico. and one of the co-chairs of romney’s hispanic outreach operation, former bush commerce secretary carlos gutierrez, has starred in a spanish-language ad this cycle — for clinton. “votar por trump? no puedo,” gutierrez says. (translation: “vote for trump? i can’t.”) romney, mccain and bush all operated spanish-language versions of their websites. romney dispatched his spanish-speaking son, craig, as an ambassador in tv ads and on the trail (“somos una nación de inmigrantes,” the younger romney said in one ad). mccain and bush, who both hailed from border states, ran spanish-languages ads. bush himself narrated some, memorably beginning them, “soy george w. bush” with his distinctive texas accent. four years ago, a total of $23 million was spent on spanish-language ads in the 2012 presidential race by obama, romney and their backers; so far in 2016, trump has spent zero. trump’s campaign declined to comment for this story. the trump campaign’s most notable dabbling in spanish consisted of a single word — and it was misused. at the republican convention in cleveland, officials handed out signs that read “hispanics para trump,” which both didn’t translate hispanics and used the incorrect spanish word for “for” (para instead of por). in recent weeks, clinton has begun airing hundreds of thousands of dollars in spanish-language ads in nevada and florida. a trio of supportive super pacs, meanwhile, have announced a $3 million spanish-language buy, so far in those same two states, as well as colorado. in addition, clinton’s running mate, tim kaine, spoke in spanish at both his vice-presidential announcement and convention speeches. her website prominently features a half-dozen buttons atop the homepage; one of them “en español” is the portal to her spanish-language site. “we have some voters that really want to communicate in spanish,” said lorella praeli, the clinton campaign’s latino outreach director, describing a three-pronged approach to wooing hispanic voters — in english, spanish and a blend of both languages of trump’s approach to latinos, praeli said, “he has insulted us and he has tried to demonize our community from the beginning.” in a sign of trump’s toxicity among hispanic voters, he’s already being attacked in spanish by a fellow republican. sen. mark kirk of illinois unveiled an ad last week touting that, “yo no apoyo a trump,” which translates as “i don’t support trump.” behind the scenes, trump’s campaign has done some quiet outreach to latino republicans — and been repeatedly rebuffed. several top hispanic republicans, including hernandez and franco, told politico they were recruited to join trump tower as surrogates or advisers. they refused. franco said he turned them down because of trump’s “gross generalizations, xenophobia and a number of comments that have absolutely crossed the line.” “i didn’t even answer,” hernandez scoffed. trump’s hispanic outreach has been run mostly by helen aguirre ferré of the republican national committee, who is respected by her peers, many of whom were surprised to see her take the job. she replaced ruth guerra, who reportedly resigned over objections to working on behalf of trump. (unlike trump, the rnc has produced some materials in spanish.) but few other prominent hispanic republicans have come on board. that has hurt the trump campaign’s presence on spanish-language television programs, where the surrogate program has been weak, said alfonso aguilar, who mobilized hispanic supporters for trump in july before rescinding his endorsement in protest over trump’s immigration speech after his mexico visit. aguilar said he told the campaign, “you’re leaving a vacuum for the opposition to define the narrative in spanish-language media and that’s exactly what’s happening.” when he was a surrogate, aguilar said, there were no talking points or fact sheets, as there had been in the romney, mccain and bush campaigns. “you can run a campaign that’s different,” aguilar said. “but you still need a professional operation.” lionel sosa, who cut ads targeting hispanic voters for ronald reagan, including in spanish, said he was among those contacted by trump’s team this year. he said he told them he would only help the campaign if trump apologized for his past offensive remarks. “i just can’t stomach donald trump,” sosa said. instead, he’s backing johnson. sosa predicted trump would win no more than 22 percent of the latino vote — worse than romney’s much-maligned 27 percent and far short of bush’s high-water mark of 44 percent in 2004. (a wall street journal/nbc news poll released on thursday put trump at 17 percent among likely hispanic voters.) the path to the white house via an overwhelmingly white coalition is a narrow one. romney won the highest share of the white vote in three decades, 59 percent, and still lost in 2012. and whites are expected to comprise a smaller share of the electorate in 2016 than 2012, due to the faster demographic growth among minorities nationwide. trump’s team recognizes the difficult math they face, given their candidate’s rhetoric and narrow coalition. it’s one of the reasons the republican nominee has begun publicly appealing to black voters, appearing at african-american churches and talking about the plight of black america at many of his rallies. the latino community has been mentioned far less often by trump. “in a way, he’s being smart,” said alex nogales, president of the national hispanic media coalition and a trump critic. “why waste his money on a community that’s not going to vote for him?”      trump’s english-only campaign      
__label__0 with red lips, blue eyes and big blond hair, a former newscaster and lounge singer named gennifer flowers had talked to a supermarket tabloid about how she had been presidential candidate bill clinton’s mistress for 12 years. it was up to his wife to fix it. so on sunday, january 26, 1992, on 60 minutes on cbs, in a time slot immediately following the super bowl, hillary clinton responded fiercely to questions about her husband’s reported infidelity and the nature of their marriage—by invoking the name of a country music star. “you know, i’m not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like tammy wynette,” she said, wearing gold earrings and a black headband, perched next to him on a couch in a hotel suite in boston and waving her clenched right hand. “i’m sitting here because i love him, and i respect him, and i honor what he’s been through and what we’ve been through together. and you know, if that’s not enough for people, then heck—don’t vote for him.” story continued below this was america’s introduction to hillary clinton, and it worked—for her husband. what she did on 60 minutes saved his candidacy and his political career. most agree he would not have become president without it. for her, however, it came at a steep cost. in 10 minutes of television, she projected a set of complicated, even conflicting images—forthright but defensive, feisty but dutiful—triggering the mix of skeptical, antagonistic feelings that have defined her with a share of the american public ever since. now, as she gets closer to the presidency than any woman ever has, she is struggling with unfavorable ratings that would be historically high if it weren’t for her opponent’s being even higher. there are substantive reasons, as with any politician with a long public record, but underlying them are the same frictions that came to the fore in that 60 minutes interview—sentiments that, fair or not, have grown only more pronounced with clinton’s perennial, awkward and generally unsuccessful efforts to re-introduce herself, to redefine herself. it didn’t have to be this way. some of her key staffers from the ’92 campaign said in interviews with politico that they feel deep, lasting regret about this legacy. there was so much to work with, they explained—her education reform, her advocacy for children, her role as a mother, as opposed to the harder, more threatening persona of an ambitious corporate attorney or do-anything operator—and yet “there was little strategic thought given to how to present her to a broader audience,” according to richard mintz, her staff director during that campaign. this, he and others said, was because of time constraints, and because the clinton bid early on was seen as a long shot, and because everybody was understandably more worried about how to package him, not her, and because staffers saw her as so intelligent and capable that it didn’t dawn on them that she would need political help herself. in retrospect, though, there was one chance to help her make a first impression, they said. and they blew it. “it’s one of the great regrets, seriously, of my life,” mintz said. “certainly i feel like we could have done, and should have done, a better job. there is a lot of regret in me,” said patti solis doyle, the veteran political strategist who was a young senior adviser to hillary clinton in that campaign. “there was never any, ‘oh, hillary could be a problem …” there was, though, a problem—albeit one that wouldn’t be fully understood for years to come. because of the dire circumstances under which she was forced to enter the national glare, the enduring paradox of hillary clinton was cemented before the super bowl champion washington redskins had flown home. the appearance on 60 minutes amounted to a mandate to come off strong enough to help him but not so strong as to hurt him, an almost impossible balancing act. even as she was putting up an effective unified front, she was presenting to an estimated 50 million viewers a tangle of contradictions. she wanted to show her independence—a quality that ended up alienating a whole set of traditionalist voters—but she was standing by her man—a decision that still today alienates younger people who see it as a kind of surrender. she had her own career, but she was also the “wife of.” it was a continuation of the fundamental tension that had underscored her almost two decades living in arkansas—but now this knotty push-pull was laid bare in the harshest of national spotlights. that image of an assertive, outspoken woman was reinforced seven weeks later when on march 16, 1992, she responded to questions about the appearance of conflicts of interest between her work as a partner at one of the most prestigious law firms in arkansas and her husband’s position as the governor of the state by unleashing a headstrong remark many women found insulting. “i suppose i could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas,” clinton snapped to reporters at a restaurant called the busy bee during a campaign stop in chicago, “but what i decided to do was to fulfill my profession, which i entered before my husband was in public life.” these two sound-bite snapshots and the time between turned clinton into a rorschach test through which people from coast to coast wrestled with a woman’s role at home, at work and in politics. she became a contentious issue in the coverage of the campaign, which led to a too-little, too-late effort to amend the approach and “soften” the look of the highest-profile surrogate, which led to the initial round of discussion in the national media about who she “really” was and whether her marriage was true love or a calculating political partnership. here heading into the last month and a half of this mad, hinge-of-history election, and as clinton prepares for another high-stakes tv moment—the hotly anticipated first debate against donald trump—her former staffers and longtime friends can’t help but look back to the 60 minutes interview and the comment about “cookies” and “teas” and see the unmistakable roots of her penchant for stilted caution and the public’s implacable suspicions. “boy,” said nancy wanderer, who’s been friends with clinton since they were classmates at wellesley college. “two short little sentences that packed a lot of punch. … i just said the other day, ‘when did this business start, when people began to not like her, not trust her?’ and i think it’s the 60 minutes interview.” “there was this way of seeing her in a certain light,” said jan piercy, another close friend from wellesley, “that she couldn’t shake.” “the great tragedy is that we lost the thread that was at her core,” said mintz, her staff director. “it’s probably one of the great political missed opportunities of all time.” *** he always needed her more than she needed him. “hillary doesn’t have to stay with bill clinton,” her friend linda bloodworth-thomason said in 1992. “she could get to the senate or possibly the white house on her own—and she knows it.” “she had more choices than any woman in america,” her friend susan thomases said the same year. “but she chose this and chose to make her life with him.” and the choice was forged from an essential compromise: a whip-smart, aggressive, yale-prepared attorney, she had left behind opportunities in east coast power cities and moved to rural, out-of-the-way arkansas to marry one of the most promising political talents of her generation. her almost two decades in the state spooled out as a series of assertions of independence—rural health care reform, state education reform, helping to start the arkansas advocates for children and families and the state’s first neonatal nursery, national recognition for her work as a lawyer, seats on boards—but also concessions. she did corporate law, which wasn’t her passion, instead of children and family law, which was, because it allowed her to be a better provider—to make a salary three to four times what her husband made as the governor. she took off her glasses and put in contact lenses. she changed her hair. she changed her clothes. she changed her name. for her own career, she wanted to be hillary rodham. for her husband’s career, she had to be hillary clinton. “i think that people who are married to politicians are under a tremendous strain,” clinton said back in 1979, in an interview on local tv weeks into her time as the wife of a governor, “because unless you have a pretty strong sense of your own self-identity, it becomes very easy to be buffeted about by all the people who are around your husband.” “she had to do this, she had to do that—and she acquiesced,” said ann henry of fayetteville, who’s been her friend for more than 40 years. “because that’s what they wanted her to do, ok? that’s what arkansas wanted her to do!” “i said, ‘hey, wait a minute, this is the woman that rose to the top at wellesley, that was president of our college government, because we thought she was so competent and intelligent,’” wanderer said. “the person she was,” wanderer said, “wasn’t going to be acceptable down there. it was a huge sacrifice.” the sacrifices continued. the fall before the 60 minutes interview, in a trip to chicago shortly after her husband had announced his presidential candidacy, she spent a night with piercy, another college friend. “she said to me, ‘you know, bill’s been attorney general and governor, and we’ve been in the public eye for years now—but there’s something that’s absolutely a different universe when you step into this running for the presidency,’” piercy said. “it really was a moment of stepping across a line, and it worried her.” two events introduced her to the nation, cementing an image of her in place in voters’ minds. it is only with the benefit of hindsight, of course, that everybody agrees bill clinton wouldn’t have been president without what hillary clinton did on january 26, 1992. it took a second-place finish in the new hampshire primary some three weeks later, after which he practically declared victory by dubbing himself “the comeback kid.” it took a faltering economy. it took a vulnerable incumbent in george h.w. bush. it took, in the end, a win in november that made him the 42nd president of the united states. he hadn’t announced he was running until october of the previous year, and in those first few months, another former staffer said in an interview, “the campaign leadership was focused on bill clinton and had not yet fully considered hillary’s role.” but all of a sudden, with the eruption of the flowers story, it couldn’t have been more clear: “we bet a whole campaign on a single interview,” communications director george stephanopoulos would write in his memoir—and hillary clinton, not bill clinton, was by far the most critical cog. “we were under pressure from the stories that had been printed in the trash tabloid,” campaign chairman mickey kantor said in an interview. “we thought the best person to address these, of anybody, was her.” as top strategist james carville would say later: “no her, no go.” “did she want to do that interview,” doyle said. “abso-frickin’-lutely not. this was survival. she was going to fight. she was fighting for her husband, for herself, for their political careers.” so in the post-super bowl interview on cbs, hillary clinton used the phrase “zone of privacy,” and he “acknowledged wrongdoing” and “causing pain in my marriage” but stopped short of an outright denial he couldn’t give without lying. but what elicited what became the most unforgettable comment from either one of them was a question from 60 minutes’ steve kroft in which he expressed the notion that their marriage was “an understanding,” “an arrangement.” “wait a minute,” bill clinton said. “you’re looking at two people who love each other. this is not an arrangement or an understanding. this is a marriage.” at which point hillary clinton piped up and said what she said about tammy wynette. “i wish i had let him have the last word,” she would write a little more than a decade later. still, at the time, what came across on the screen, at least to her friends all over the country, was … authentically her. “that was my friend,” said little rock’s skip rutherford, who watched at a super bowl party turned clinton viewing. “that was my friend hillary.” *** she called doyle the night it aired. “she called me to ask how i thought it went,” doyle said. “i told her i thought she was really strong, really forceful, and appeared really committed to her husband and to her family.” clinton thanked her. “she was definitely pleased,” doyle added. “she was happy with it because she was truthful. she said what she had to say. i love this guy. i respect this guy. very matter of fact.” and in many corners of the press, she was praised. the economist called her “sharp-tongued” and “attractive.” “tough woman, this hillary clinton,” wrote a columnist for the los angeles daily news. the tv critic at the washington post said bill clinton “looked like a scared kid. not a presidential image. hillary clinton, on the other hand, appeared impressively impervious, suggesting perhaps that the wrong clinton is running for office.” she was lauded even by a leading new hampshire republican. said tom rath, then a george h.w. bush appointee as a director of the legal services corporation and now a politico insider, to the atlanta journal-constitution the day after 60 minutes: “the big winner was hillary clinton. i think he’s got a problem still.” but she also drew some fire from outside the pundit class. “tammy’s madder than hell,” wynette’s fifth husband told usa today. wynette wrote a plainspoken open letter in which she actually cut right to the crux, demanding an apology and portraying the aspiring west wing spouse as an elitist enabler riding her husband’s coattails. “i believe you have offended every person who has made it on their own with no one to take them to the white house,” the singer said. she challenged clinton to “stand toe to toe with me. i can assure you, in spite of your education, you will find me to be just as bright.” told of wynette’s reaction during a meeting with the editorial board of a small newspaper in grand junction, colorado, clinton rolled her eyes and slapped her forehead, according to an account from the associated press. “i didn’t mean to hurt tammy wynette as a person,” she said. “i happen to be a country-western fan.” but clinton couldn’t find the right tone and stick with it. she seemed to vacillate between apologetic and apoplectic. she said sorry to wynette, again, two nights later on national tv on abc’s primetime live—in a lengthy feature in which she also offered up a withering dismissal of flowers, calling her a money-grubber, a fame-chaser, “some failed cabaret singer who doesn’t have much of a resume to fall back on.” and the world offered its critique. even richard nixon weighed in. “if the wife comes through as being too strong and too intelligent, it makes the husband look like a wimp,” the former president told the new york times a week and a half after the 60 minutes interview. nixon cited barbara bush as the model wife—somebody who has her own opinions but doesn’t upstage her husband. by march, a new narrative had emerged. said the washington post: “hillary clinton, trying to have it all; lawyer, author, activist, strategist, mother, political wife … and now, political problem?” further complicating matters for her: the first story in the times about the money-losing real estate deal in northwest arkansas that ultimately would metastasize into the whitewater scandal and an article in the post headlined, “the uncertain intersection: politics and private interests; hillary clinton’s law firm is influential with state.” jerry brown, the governor of california and an opponent in the presidential primaries, brought up the post article in a debate, accusing bill clinton of funneling money to his wife’s firm—a false representation. he responded to brown’s charge of “corruption” by calling him a liar and saying he “ought to be ashamed” for “jumping on my wife.” the next day, the day before the illinois and michigan primaries, with stress mounting, reporters approached hillary clinton at the busy bee. “back then,” said jim cullinan, a staff aide doing her advance work, who was there, “it was much more casual in terms of the press being close to her.” out came the comment about “cookies” and “teas.” “exasperation,” said piercy, her friend. “complete exasperation.” “just pure frustration,” said jody franklin, her chief of staff on that campaign. “i think this country wasn’t ready for a professional, strong, highly competent, feminist first lady—i think the country was not ready for that, and the campaign didn’t understand that,” franklin said. “and there she was, getting humiliated on 60 minutes, saving him—and then she gets shit for it. and then she gets shit for … working, for simply having a job.” *** the clinton brain trust knew immediately “cookies” and “teas” would be a big problem. “as soon as i heard that,” paul begala, a chief strategist for the campaign, would say in 2000, “i thought, ‘people are going to take that out of context. they’re going to suggest she doesn’t care about stay-at-home moms.’ so i went up to her and i told her that. i pulled her aside, and i said, ‘you know, hillary, you’ve got to go restate this. people are going to think that’s an attack on stay-at-home moms.’ and she had the most wounded and naïve look on her face. … she had no idea that might be taken out of context. she said, ‘no one could think that.’ she said, ‘i would have given anything to be a stay-at-home mom. my mother was a stay-at-home mom. i just didn’t have a choice because bill was making $35,000 a year and we needed to support the family.’ i said, ‘i know that.’ and she said, ‘oh, you worry too much.’ i mean, it was unimaginable to her that that would be a firestorm. i was certain it would be.” so outside, on the sidewalk in the cold, she tried to clean it up. “the work that i’ve done as a professional,” she explained, “as a public advocate, has been aimed in part to assure that women can make the choices that they should make—whether it’s full-time career, full-time motherhood, some combination, depending upon what stage of life they are at.” it didn’t help. and there she was, getting humiliated on 60 minutes, saving him—and then she gets shit for it.” the next day, her husband won the primaries in michigan and illinois, closing in on the democratic nomination—but headlines were about her. “hillary clinton law career brings up spouse role issue,” said the los angeles times. “hillary clinton is fair political game,” said the chicago tribune. “hillary clinton defends herself,” said the boston globe. and on nbc, making a connection that would calcify from there, correspondent lisa myers tied “cookies” and “teas” to 60 minutes. “hillary clinton’s strong performance during the gennifer flowers episode helped save her husband’s candidacy,” myers reported. “but now, she may be fast becoming an issue herself.” times columnist william safire gave it a name: “the hillary problem.” gloria cabe, the campaign’s congressional liaison and the manager of its office in washington, worried that it had the potential to be “fatal.” “we got lots of phone calls,” cabe later said. “and it was apparent to me that not only were we hearing from traditional women who had chosen, for whatever reason, to stay at home with their children, but we were inundated with calls from professional women who felt it had insulted them, who had made the decision to take a few years off—and many of them talked about baking cookies.” the campaign devised a course shift—the sort of hillary-specific strategy her advisers say hadn’t totally existed up until that point—and it happened quickly. “hillary clinton,” newsweek noticed in late march, two weeks post-busy bee, “has clearly lowered her profile on the campaign trail.” bill clinton pulled back his “buy one, get one free” stump-speech catchphrase, which had prompted talk of a kind of “co-presidency,” and hillary clinton started talking less about policy and more about family. she agreed to participate in a cookie bake-off sponsored by family circle magazine. she agreed to an interview for a puffy people profile about their friends, family and faith. she got her hair styled. she took off her unfussy professional woman headband. in may, she gave the graduation speech at her alma mater, 23 years after she spoke at commencement as a student. “as women today, you face tough choices,” she told the wellesley college class of 1992. “you know the rules are basically as follows,” she said. “if you don’t get married, you’re abnormal. if you get married but don’t have children, you’re a selfish yuppie. if you get married and have children, but work outside the home, you’re a bad mother. if you get married and have children, but stay home, you’ve wasted your education. “so you see,” she concluded, “if you listen to all the people who make these rules, you might just conclude that the safest course of action is just to take your diploma and crawl under your bed.” so you see,” hillary concluded, “if you listen to all the people who make these rules, you might just conclude that the safest course of action is just to take your diploma and crawl under your bed.” she didn’t do that. but she did agree to adjustments—the latest in a sequence that had started with her acquiescences in arkansas. “my recollection is that after the convention,” said franklin, her chief of staff, “there was a very significant, purposeful shift in strategy.” it included appearances like a stop at a vocational school, doyle remembered, to stage a photo-op of her getting her nails done by the cosmetology students. “she was like, ‘really? this is what i’m doing now?’” “after those situations”—tammy wynette, “cookies” and “teas”—“the campaign … decided to use her to rally the base, a broad democratic base who adored her. but that was like putting her in a box,” franklin said. “she was put in a box for the rest of the campaign—and it worked.” “the political image makers are hard at it this year,” tom brokaw said on nbc news in early august, a few weeks after the convention. “they worried that hillary clinton was coming off as too bright, too outspoken, too upfront. so, they asked her to warm it up a bit.” it wasn’t lost on everybody—including some in the press—that her principal transgression actually seemed to be that she was a woman who said what she thought instead of quietly receding into the conventionally accepted political staging. “women who are not clearly submissive are seen as dominating and reviled for it. women who do fit the images [of submissiveness] are not taken seriously. like hillary clinton, you are damned if you do and damned if you don’t.” “politicians in both parties like to say that this is the year of the woman,” correspondent andrea mitchell pointed out in her brokaw-introduced report. “but that doesn’t necessarily apply to the politician’s wife.” she compared the hillary clinton of the primaries with the hillary clinton of the general election. “when the wives are introduced these days,” mitchell said, referring to hillary clinton and running mate al gore’s wife, tipper, “it’s to take a bow and step back.” throughout the summer and fall, a shorthand tag developed among newspapers, news magazines and the tv networks. “the hillary factor,” they started calling it. “is she helping or hurting her husband,” time asked on its cover in september. “but the real hillary factor,” argued deborah tannen, then a fellow at stanford’s center for advanced study in behavioral sciences, in an op-ed in october in the times, “is the double bind that affects all successful or accomplished women—indeed, all women who do not fit stereotypical images of femininity: women who are not clearly submissive are seen as dominating and reviled for it. women who do fit the images are not taken seriously. like hillary clinton, you are damned if you do and damned if you don’t.” *** that november, obviously, bill clinton won—but his wife discovered that the tightrope she had walked in the 60 minutes interview just kept going. she walked it as she took her place as a policy advisor with an office in the west wing instead of the customary first lady quarters on the other side of the white house. she walked it as she led health care reform—and then stumbled, necessitating another recalibration, another “softening.” she walked it in 1998 through the monica lewinsky scandal, returning to national tv to mount another defense of her husband that he ultimately didn’t deserve—this time on the today show on nbc, this time alone, this time talking not about tammy wynette but a “vast right-wing conspiracy,” sparking echoes of 60 minutes and bolstering the skepticism about their marriage, that it was mostly a union of political expedience. she walked the tightrope out of the white house, too, her eye on a political prize of her own—which she won. in the senate, she walked it still, the world-famous former first lady who tried at the start to be head-down, back-bench anonymous, the aisle-crossing policy wonk who attempted to show a stern side with her vote to support the invasion of iraq. and she walked it in 2007 and 2008, through her first presidential bid, beating barack obama in the new hampshire primary only after she cracked just a tad at a campaign stop at another eatery—16 years after the busy bee—and almost cried. “re-re-re-reintroducing hillary clinton,” the new york times magazine headlined a story last summer at the outset of her current campaign. the “issue of her political authenticity,” university of maryland communications professor shawn j. parry-giles wrote in her 2014 book hillary clinton in the news: gender and authenticity in american politics, has been a “preouccupation” of the press that has “dogged” clinton “from 1992 onward.” all these questions—why is she so stiff? why is she so scripted? why is she so cautious? why is she so secretive?—i think it all goes back to 1992.” “i don’t know that mrs. clinton has ever fully recovered from the difficulties of the early stages of that campaign,” said russell riley, a professor and co-chair of the university of virginia’s presidential oral history program. “all these questions—why is she so stiff? why is she so scripted? why is she so cautious? why is she so secretive?—i think it all goes back to 1992,” said tannen, now a professor of linguistics at georgetown. that interview plus “cookies” and “teas,” said wanderer, her friend from wellesley, added up to “an odd introduction, because i think both of those moments represented her trying to explain who she really is. but instead of saying what she actually is—a person dedicated to making positive changes to move the country forward in what you might call a progressive way—i think she felt very defensive about it, like this wasn’t going to be acceptable.” i’m not sitting here, some little woman … i suppose i could have … “is she guarded all the time?” franklin, her chief of staff in that ’92 campaign, said this week. “i think she is. and i understand why.” in both the 60 minutes interview and the comment at the busy bee, franklin said, “she was herself, she said what she believed, and with personality. but it was misinterpreted. and she got screwed for it.” to doyle, one of clinton’s closest advisers throughout that campaign, it all started with the 60 minutes interview—about which, she said, there are two great truths. the first? “he would not have been president had she not defended him, period, end of story.” and the second? “there was no way for her to win in that situation, no way for her to win there, as a woman.”      the tv interview that

__label__0 politico politico's must-read briefing on what's driving the day in washington government shutdown fight: what you need to know -- if congress doesn’t get its act together, the government shuts down next friday night. and, perhaps predictably, trouble has sprouted up. the senate is in the middle of a standoff, of sorts, over a bill to fund the government through december. ap’s andy taylor says democrats are going to block the bill’s passage because it doesn’t include “$220 million to help flint and other cities with lead emergencies replace pipes and take other steps to clean their water.” http://apne.ws/2chpi2y here is how a top senate republican and and a top senate democratic aide describe the standoff. --the republican: “senators wanted a clean cr [continuing resolution] with no poison pills. senators on both sides of the aisle said that zika was a crisis that couldn’t wait another day, that zika was more important than any partisan riders. they wanted a bill that funded these zika efforts, funded our veterans, addressed the opioid crisis and flood relief for places like maryland, west virginia, texas and louisiana, and stayed within the budget caps. this 10-week clean cr does all of that -- it’s a fair proposal that contains exactly zero partisan poison-pill riders from either party. and it’s completed in time to finish our work before funding runs out at the end of the month -- as long as democrats don’t filibuster. again. story continued below “every rider that democrats offered as an excuse for opposing the bill is gone. to now bring us to the brink of a government shutdown over a provision that’s not even in the bill, and that was funded elsewhere, would take obstruction to an obscene new level. democrats will now have several days to hear from their constituents. and then they’ll have a chance on tuesday to move forward on this bipartisan funding bill. we certainly hope they put our veterans, our troops, zika victims and families torn apart by opioid abuse above petty politics.” --the democrat: “senator mcconnell made a huge miscalculation pulling out of negotiations and putting this partisan bill on the floor, and republican senators are going to have a tough time explaining why they want to give help to anywhere but flint. this is quickly turning into the nightmare scenario that republicans wanted to avoid -- they’re going to be four days away from a government shutdown over their insistence on providing aid everywhere but flint, just six short weeks before the election.” --what we think: you think this is bad? come on! it’s not really in anyone’s interest to shut down the government less than two months before election day. nobody is predicting that this is going to lead to a shutdown. they have a week -- the government doesn’t shut down until next friday -- and congress rarely does anything until it absolutely has to. **subscribe to playbook: http://politi.co/1m75ubx happy friday! we’re 46 days

charlotte observer’s mark washburn, jim morrill and adam bell: “two narratives of the police videos showing the fatal shooting of a charlotte man emerged thursday – one from police saying the shots appeared justified, another from the family of keith lamont scott saying he was killed while walking backward, hands at his side. ‘after watching the videos,’ said justin bamberg, an attorney for scott’s relatives, ‘the family again has more questions than answers.’ … scott’s demeanor was calm and nonaggressive, said bamberg, who called upon cmpd to release the videos publicly in the name of transparency. “‘while police did give him several commands,’ the attorney said, ‘he did not aggressively approach them or raise his hands at members of law enforcement at any time.’...‘it was incredibly difficult for members of the scott family to view these videos, but as a matter of the greater good and transparency,’ bamberg said, ‘the scott family asks that the charlotte-mecklenburg police department publicly immediately release both of the videos they watched today.’ charlotte-mecklenburg police chief kerr putney said he reviewed the videos and they do not ‘give me absolute, definitive visual evidence that will confirm a person was pointing a gun. i did not see that in the video.’ but putney said the ‘totality’ of the evidence supports the police conclusion that officers confronting scott faced an imminent, deadly threat. putney said the videos would not be released because, among other reasons, it might infringe upon a parallel state investigation into the shooting.” http://bit.ly/2cwatui … charlotte observer a1 http://politi.co/2clxfpu -- nyt’s richard fausset and alan blinder in charlotte on a1: “fatal shooting by police shakes charlotte’s self-image”: “this has always been a place that has prided itself on order, consensus and a can-do corporate mentality that turned a locale with no real geographic reason to exist into one of the hemisphere’s financial dynamos. it has also gained a reputation for racial amity, from its nationally recognized commitment to busing and integrated schools in the 1970s and ’80s, to the election of harvey gantt in 1983 as one of the south’s first prominent black mayors. but the fatal police shooting on tuesday of a black resident, keith lamont scott, and the protests that have followed are among numerous bumps and jolts that have shaken charlotte’s sense of itself recently as it emerged from a successful small city to a more complicated larger one.” http://nyti.ms/2d5pusp obama on the violent protests in charlotte: “the way we change the system requires to be able to reach out and engage the broader american community and that requires being peaceful, that requires being thoughtful about what are the specific reforms you’re looking for,” in an interview with abc “good morning america” co-anchor robin roberts. “[the] overwhelming majority of people who have been concerned about police-community relations [are] doing it the right way … every once in a while you see folks doing it the wrong way … i think it's important to separate out the pervasive sense of frustration among a lot of african americans about shootings of people and the sense that justice is not always color blind.” http://abcn.ws/2cksddc dept of dark arts -- “key lawmakers accuse russia of campaign to disrupt u.s. election,” by wapo’s greg miller: “two senior democratic lawmakers with access to classified intelligence on thursday accused russia of ‘making a serious and concerted effort to influence the u.s. election,’ a charge that appeared aimed at putting pressure on the obama administration to confront moscow. the jointly issued statement from sen. dianne feinstein and rep. adam b. schiff — californians who are the ranking democrats on the senate and house intelligence committees, respectively — described recent cyber penetrations of the [dnc] and other u.s. political entities as intrusions that were likely directed by russian president vladi­mir putin. ‘at the least, this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes,’ the statement said. ‘we believe that orders for the russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the russian government.’”

major-party presidential candidate this century not to reach out to millions of american voters whose dominant, first or just preferred language is spanish. trump has not only failed to buy any spanish-language television or radio ads, he so far has avoided even offering a translation of his website into spanish, breaking with two decades of bipartisan tradition.” http://politi.co/2d9ksoc -- “on campaign call, clinton latino supporters air concerns on youth support and ads,” by buzzfeed’s adrian carrasquillo: “a clinton campaign call with latino supporters took on new seriousness thursday regarding the support of young voters and state of spanish-language advertising, reflecting concerns with tightening poll numbers in the campaign’s final weeks. ‘i’ve had concerns for a while,’ said one participant on the call who speaks with donors. ‘it feels like it’s a little late to be coming now with this stuff but hopefully they’ve course corrected.’ what’s coming is a new spanish-language ad push announced on the call. that announcement follows skittish democrats chastising the campaign in a washington post report for starting a concerted advertising campaign later than president obama did in his 2012 race. ‘we will have more to say soon, but the campaign will continue to advertise on spanish tv and radio, as well as targeting latino households through tv in english until election day,’ a clinton aide told buzzfeed news.” http://bzfd.it/2cw326c what brooklyn is reading -- “inside hillary clinton's debate prep,” by annie karni and glenn thrush: “no secret on the clinton campaign has been more closely guarded than the identity of the person who is impersonating trump in the closed-door sessions staged at clinton's manhattan office and at her home in chappaqua. clinton’s advisers, in conversations over the last month, have repeatedly emphasized that the mock debate session, while important, is less vital than the informal law school sessions where clinton hashes out her reactions and attacks ... “several democrats who have spoken to the participants tell politico that the main person playing the role of interlocutor -- up until this weekend anyway, where there will be a real trump stand-in -- was campaign chairman john podesta, a sharp-tongued veteran operator known less for bluster than behind-the-curtain scheme-spinning. the wiry podesta is quick on his feet, and is famous for a lashing tongue when angry. the buttoned-down, courtly [ron] klain has also stood in parrying questions with clinton, according to people close to the situation - but both men have been less concerned with imitating trump than preparing clinton for the substance of the attacks, two keen attorneys framing clinton’s reactions in the precise, disciplined language their lawyerly candidate thrives on.” http://politi.co/2cqb57l -- “clinton seeks big jump in estate tax: plan would levy 65% tax on largest estates—up from today’s 40% — and make it harder for wealthy people to pass assets on to heirs tax-free,” by wsj tax master rich rubin: “the proposals mark an expansion of the tax increases mrs. clinton would impose on the uppermost sliver of america’s affluent. the increase in estate and gift taxes and other new items mrs. clinton detailed thursday follow two ideas central to her campaign. first, she pairs proposed spending increases and tax cuts with tax increases to prevent projected budget deficits from growing. and she targets tax increases at the top of the income and wealth scale. “the latest proposals would generate $260 billion over the next decade, enough to pay for her plans to simplify small-business taxes and expand the child tax credit, according to the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget, which advocates fiscal restraint. in all, mrs. clinton would raise taxes by about $1.5 trillion over the next decade to pay for expanded education assistance, paid family leave and other programs. she would increase federal revenue by about 4%, though the added burden would be concentrated on relatively few households.” http://on.wsj.com/2cshcsb --frank luntz on time.com, “how hillary clinton can defeat donald

2016,’ which airs next tuesday night on pbs. ‘i think that is the night that he resolves to run for president,’ roger stone, a longtime trump adviser and confidant, says in the film. ‘i think that he

steve hilton, who was once director of strategy for former u.k. prime minister david cameron, now spends his time trying to disrupt american politics. the co-founder and ceo of crowdpac, a nonpartisan political crowdfunding startup that aims help citizens engage in politics through data and online tools, is trying to shake up the cottage industry of ballot measures. the group is releasing a new tool that allows users to contribute money to specific ballot measures on issues like gun control, raising the minimum wage, charter schools and legalizing marijuana in multiple states. http://bit.ly/2cqjd9i “we’re taking something that is a really big feature of politics and the way issues are handled at the state level and right across the country, which is ballot measures, which is often the way important changes on issues that people care about actually happen, and we’re trying to demystify that process and make it easier for people to understand what’s going on and participate directly,” hilton said. change in politics happens by working within the system: “there has been this slightly naïve and perhaps arrogant view that technology can completely reinvent the political system and the way that government and politics works, which is ridiculous … the challenge is to get people involved in the system we have.” ballot measures are more reliable than candidates: “a lot of people are driven by an interest by one particular issue or a small number of specific issues rather than a candidate or a party or something broader … the fact is on certain issues it is through ballot measures that they are advanced, or not advanced depending on whether the ballot measure is passed.” trump, sanders are just the beginning: “[there’s] a real sense of a

__label__0 a liberal attempt to revive the so-called public option — a government-run insurance plan to shore up gaps in the affordable care act — is opening old wounds between the democratic party’s liberal and moderate wings. thirty-three mostly liberal democrats, including all the senate leadership, have signed onto a nonbinding senate resolution introduced last friday to add the public option to obamacare, arguing that it is needed to fix problems with the president’s signature health care law. story continued below but missing from the list are vice-presidential nominee tim kaine and a half-dozen other moderates who face reelection in 2018 — when the map that favors democrats this year will flip to favor republicans. kaine’s absence is especially striking since hillary clinton embraced the public option in july. a campaign spokesperson said kaine is “supportive of a workable public option for health care insurance,” even though he has not co-sponsored the resolution. but other moderate democratic senators made it clear that they remain uncomfortable with a government-run health program. sen. jon tester, a moderate montana democrat up for reelection in 2018, said the focus should be on working “on a bipartisan basis to fix obamacare.” “until we get to the point that we’re willing to work together on that … we’re going to continue to see problems,” tester said. sen. heidi heitkamp (d-n.d.), who won her 2012 election with 50.24 percent of the vote and is expected to face a tight race in 2018, called the public-option debate a “distraction.” “we’ve had a whole lot of discussion about what’s going to happen to obamacare but … we aren’t having discussions [about how we deliver higher-quality care at lower costs] because we keep discussing how we’re going to fund it,” she said. the resistance of moderate democrats led to the scuttling of the public option when it was first debated as a potential part of the aca in 2009. now, the continued divide between liberals and moderates could be a preview of coming battles if clinton were to become president and liberals mounted a serious effort to add a public option to obamacare. since the aca was conceived, liberals have insisted that a government-run health insurer would pressure private insurers to reduce premiums. now, progressives say, many of the aca’s flaws could be repaired with a public option, which would essentially be a new plan offered on the obamacare insurance exchanges, some of which are down to only one or two private insurers. clinton has repeatedly said on the campaign trail that she would “defend” the affordable care act if elected president. her campaign website pledges that she will “build on its success to bring the promise of affordable health care to more people and make a ‘public option’ possible.” sen. jeff merkley (d-ore.), who is spearheading the effort, said that besides clinton’s endorsement, rising premiums and the high-profile withdrawal of aetna and united healthcare from several exchanges makes the issue ripe for discussion. “we’re right in the middle of the presidential campaign, and i think it’s important during this campaign and [house and senate races] to have a conversation about having competition in all the exchanges across the country,” merkley said. he downplayed the lack of support from moderates and said he has not run the resolution by the clinton campaign. he pointed out that all of the democratic leaders have signed on as cosponsors. “so there is a wide range of folks — folks from states that have big insurance companies’ headquarters, like connecticut — folks who don’t. it’s a broad spectrum,” he said. “we’re only a couple days into this.” adam green, co-founder of the progressive change campaign committee, which is championing the resolution, said the goal is to build momentum to enact a public option next year. green said he’s happy with 33 co-sponsors so far and hopeful that moderate lawmakers from rural states are drawn to the idea of more competition among insurers. “rural states have big problems with competition, and having a public option would actually be really popular in those states,” he said. but some red-state democrats are skeptical. sen. claire mccaskill (d-mo.), who is also due to face voters in 2018, said she’s open to discussing the public option “but i want to make sure that we’ve done everything to make the market work before we turn to that.” republicans are already trying to frame the public option as “more obamacare,” a preview of the battle that could come if democrats are in a position to pursue the proposal. “democrats actually introduced legislation last week calling for obamacare 2.0, a new government-run health plan,” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said wednesday. “and there are good reasons why so many of their own caucus won’t support it. it’s insulting to the millions of americans who continue to watch their premiums spike — after democrats said they’d be lower.”      democratic liberals, moderates feud over public option      
__label__0 pat toomey is your classic, pro-trade republican. the former president of the free trade-promoting club for growth has backed a slew of trade deals during his 12 years in congress, and last year he even praised president barack obama’s trans-pacific partnership as an economic boon that would help pennsylvania’s economy. then along came donald trump and his america-first, trade-bashing platform. now toomey — among the most vulnerable incumbent republicans up for reelection this fall — is urging obama to dump the tpp. story continued below toomey has plenty of company among republicans on the senate ballot. the gop’s unshakable faith in free trade has been decidedly broken in the year of trump — with everyone from a former u.s. trade representative, rob portman of ohio, to free-market devotee marco rubio of florida striking a much different tone. indeed, the upended politics of trade offer a major conundrum for establishment-minded republicans running for reelection this year, particularly in rust belt states that could help determine control of the senate next year. perhaps more than any other issue, trade has illustrated the tightrope gop candidates have to walk in trying to appeal to trump-fueled voters while not abandoning the gop’s core economic principles. “i’ve always believed that you actually have to get an agreement that merits the support,” toomey said in an interview when asked whether his tpp opposition was inconsistent with his record. pointing to its dairy and intellectual property provisions, toomey, who was careful never to explicitly endorse the trade deal as it was being negotiated, added: “there are real problems with tpp.” of the republicans who are running in the most closely watched senate races this cycle, just two have publicly embraced the controversial trade deal: john mccain of arizona — who warned that the united states’ future in asia hinges on the tpp — and mark kirk of illinois. one other republican, chuck grassley of iowa, is favorable toward tpp’s agriculture provisions but won’t weigh in on the other parts. back in april 2015, rubio wrote an op-ed in the wall street journal and urged passage of tpp, which would “further our strategic goals in asia and increase prosperity at home.” in an interview with politico this week, rubio said he is still evaluating the trade deal but noted that he was “disappointed” with results of a report from the international trade commission that gauged the tpp’s economic impact. pressed on whether his concerns about the tpp constitute a reversal, rubio responded, “how can it be? you can’t endorse a deal that isn’t written yet.” “the tpp as a concept is something i support. i’d love to have a free trade agreement with the asia-pacific region. but it has to be the right deal,” rubio said. “just like i support home ownership, but it has to be under the right terms.” rep. todd young (r-ind.), running for the senate seat in indiana, says he has “real problems” with tpp because its intellectual property provisions could harm eli lilly and co., a pharmaceutical company headquartered in indianapolis. and republican sens. roy blunt of missouri and kelly ayotte of new hampshire have their own problems with the trade deal with asia. in ayotte’s case, she’s even cited trade as one area on which she agrees with trump. all of them voted in favor of a procedural measure last year that would allow obama to ultimately fast-track the trade deal without any amendments. the election-year shift on trade is not limited to republicans. hillary clinton famously pivoted on tpp after praising the deal as the “gold standard” of trade agreements as secretary of state. and sen. tim kaine of virginia was praising provisions of the tpp just days before he was selected as clinton’s running mate. as soon as he joined the ticket, kaine came out in opposition to the pacific rim deal. back in pennsylvania, toomey and his allies correctly point out that katie mcginty, toomey’s democratic challenger, supported and touted the north american free trade agreement as an official in the clinton administration. but the republican sprint away from the tpp is a remarkable policy reversal for a party that has traditionally championed itself as the party of free trade. “on the campaign trail, it’s just too difficult to quantify the gains from free trade and too easy to point at a plant that closed and scapegoat trade,” sen. jeff flake (r-ariz.) said. he added that trump was “obviously” a factor and said in an election year, “it always comes up like this. but it seems to be bigger this year.” mccain has warned that u.s. influence in asia could diminish if congress doesn’t approve tpp. and another reason that explains mccain’s warmth for trade, despite its decreasing popularity: arizona’s robust trade relationship with neighboring mexico that amounts to $16 billion in goods and services exchanged per year. “i believe in free trade, and i’m a student of history,” mccain said in defending his support for the deal, which democratic challenger ann kirkpatrick opposes. nowhere does the political toxicity over trade resonate more than in labor-heavy states, with unions vehemently opposing the deal and democrats trying to stoke that sentiment to turn out those voters against republicans. in nevada, democrat catherine cortez masto expressed her opposition to the tpp months ago and has underscored that stance in front of union audiences such as the afl-cio. meanwhile, republican rep. joe heck — who also voted to fast-track the trade deal last year — has declined to take an official position on the agreement, though he said he had “some concerns” about some of the trade deal’s provisions. “i think it’s difficult when you have a trade agreement with so many disparate partners that it’s hard to strike a good balance,” heck said in an interview. he did not elaborate on his concerns. the massive trade deal’s prospects this year on capitol hill have all but evaporated, despite an intense public relations campaign from the obama administration that continued through last week. an undeterred obama hosted an elaborate event promoting the 12-nation deal last week, even marshaling ohio gov. john kasich — a gop presidential candidate vanquished by trump earlier this year — to the white house to help press his case. yet ohio’s own incumbent gop senator, portman—who has a lengthy pro-trade record and counts kasich as one of his most powerful boosters—came out in opposition to the pacific rim trade deal in february. democrat ted strickland, who has struggled to gain traction, has hammered portman over his past support of trade deals. but portman, like toomey, said his stances on trade have been consistent. “it hasn’t put me in a tough position because i’ve taken the same position for years … which is balanced trade,” he said. “we should open up more markets but we also have to make sure it’s fair as imports come into our country. so i’m very comfortable with that position and that’s where most ohioans are.” few expect capitol hill to act on the tpp while obama remains in office, despite pressure from its advocates to take it up in the lame duck. details of the massive trade deal remain largely unknown to voters; an august poll from morning consult showed that 62 percent of registered voters said they had heard little or nothing about the agreement. that same poll found that about 35 percent of voters support the trade deal and 22 percent oppose it, but 43 percent had no opinion. meanwhile, other republicans running for reelection have simply declined to answer questions about their tpp position. wisconsin sen. ron johnson has yet to take a stance on tpp and declined in an interview to say whether he even has any concerns. he rebuffed democratic challenger russ feingold’s attempts to needle him into a position, accusing feingold of making a “knee-jerk snap decision” on tpp. “this is over 6,000 pages. he read a 60-page leaked version on wikileaks?” johnson said of the deal, which has numerous chapters and totals more than 5,000 pages, especially because it includes extensive lists of every tariff being cut. “i’m not feeling any pressure whatsoever. i’m actually doing my job and doing the hard work that i think wisconsinites expect out of their senator.” elena schneider and jeremy herb contributed to this report.      gop senators succumb to trump’s war on trade

__label__0 politico politico's must-read briefing on what's driving the day in washington another shooting in charlotte -- with 47 days until election day, the national conversation is turning once again to a politically fraught set of interlocking issues: race, policing and urban crime. late last night, gov. pat mccrory declared a state of emergency in north carolina after more protests in charlotte. one man was shot, and is on life support. national guard and state highway patrolmen are assisting local police officers. -- charlotte observer: “[t]he unrest continued wednesday night, with police using tear gas to disperse hundreds of protesters who blocked the intersection of trade and tryon streets in the heart of uptown, then occupied the epicentre entertainment complex. pockets of the city were on edge late wednesday afternoon, with some uptown businesses apparently sending workers home early over uncertainty about further protests. the charlotte chamber urged businesses in uptown and university city to ‘remove or chain down all tables, chairs, signs or planters.’ at about 4:30 wednesday, a group of two dozen protesters stood in front of the bank of america tower at trade and tryon streets. they silently stood and held signs reading ‘black lives matter’ and ‘stop killing us.’” http://bit.ly/2d1q73e charlotte observer a1 http://politi.co/2dbpl62 headline: “violent protests return as city seeks answers” story continued below --nyt’s richard fausset and alan blinder: “a second night of protests set off by the police killing of a black man spiraled into chaos and violence after nightfall here wednesday when a demonstration was interrupted by gunfire that gravely wounded a man in the crowd. law enforcement authorities fired tear gas in a desperate bid to restore order. the city said on its twitter account that the unidentified man was on life support after what officials said was a ‘civilian on civilian’ confrontation. the authorities provided no further details. charlotte officials had said earlier that the man had been killed in the unrest. the police department reported that four officers had injuries that were not life-threatening … “the gunshot victim lay motionless on the ground, his eyes open, as people surrounded him and blood pooled among their feet. he was taken into the nearby omni hotel, and a series of confrontations played out afterward as the police kept people from entering. there was sporadic looting. twitter messages showed that the team store of the charlotte hornets of the n.b.a. had been broken into and gutted of merchandise. ‘we are working very hard to bring peace and calm back to our city,’ mayor jennifer roberts said on cnn.” http://nyti.ms/2dj8x3x … a1 (lead story has large photo of gunshot victim)

wagner and abby phillip in orlando: “democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton is pushing intensively to win over a group of voters who don’t typically get much attention during elections but who have become an increasingly potent political force: disabled people and their families. with the race tighter than it was a month ago and clinton struggling to generate enthusiasm within the democratic base, her appeal to disabled people and their families comes amid a broader effort to win over voters. after weeks of mostly attacking republican donald trump, she is highlighting specific policy prescriptions while trying to show a more compassionate side and present an affirmative vision for the country. “clinton is also targeting hispanics, women, caretakers of the elderly and sick, and families of gun-violence victims, among other constituencies focused on specific issues. in the case of the disability community, which cuts across all partisan and demographic divides, clinton may be trying to attract not only ­democratic-leaning voters who are not excited by her candidacy, but also voters who may be leaning toward trump -- notably disabled veterans.” http://wapo.st/2cexm4o -- “trump’s bizarre ad strategy: it’s less than 50 days until the election and the gop nominee’s television advertisements have all but vanished,” by steven shepard: “trump’s ads last ran nearly a week ago in four battleground states: florida, north carolina, ohio and pennsylvania. since then, the gop presidential nominee has ceded the airwaves to hillary clinton -- and is only poised to launch a limited, less-targeted ad campaign in the days before next week’s debate. “while his campaign announced a new ad on tuesday, it’s only going to run on national cable news stations and during two sunday morning public-affairs shows, according to data from the tracking firm, a company that monitors media buys. and even with that seemingly modest buy — the full extent of which wasn’t clear on wednesday night — clinton is still outspending him this week many times over. ‘it’s unprecedented for a major-party nominee in this century to have such an on-again, off-again tv buy,’ said elizabeth

example of that is the situation in syria, which haunts me constantly. i would say of all the things that have happened during the course of my presidency the knowledge that you have hundreds of

arguments about what could have been done are wrong. the notion that if we had provided some more modest arms to syrian rebels—that somehow that would have led to [syrian president bashar al-] assad’s overthrow more decisively. the notion that if i had taken a pinprick strike when the chemical-weapons issue came out, as opposed to negotiating and getting all those chemical weapons out—that that

because i think that in this job one of the things you realize is there are problems that just end up being really hard and by definition the only problems that come to my desk are the ones that

__label__0 nine years ago, a driver lost control of his pickup truck and crashed into the confederate monument on the front lawn of the franklin county courthouse, decapitating the marble soldier. some locals who found the monument offensive said they were glad to see it go, but there was never much doubt that once the money was raised, the soldier would be back. the rededication ceremony in 2010 drew a crowd of about 500 people—women wore hoop skirts and men donned the gray uniforms of confederate soldiers. “we’re very proud of it,” says linda stanley, managing director of the franklin county historical society in rocky mount, virginia, 25 miles southeast of roanoke. “this whole county’s very, very patriotic.” story continued below this was the way skirmishes over confederate history have often gone—history is replaced, not rewritten. that is, until last year, when white supremacist dylann roof gunned down nine people at an african-american church in charleston, south carolina. the massacre set off a national debate about confederate symbols in public places, leading to an intense and ultimately successful campaign to permanently remove the confederate flag from the south carolina capitol grounds, where it had flown for decades. but for every nationally publicized debate like the one over south carolina’s flag, there are dozens of smaller battles in places like franklin county. and this is especially true in virginia, which, as the former home to the capital of the confederacy, has more confederate monuments—223—than any other state. virginia, increasingly diverse and progressive, embodies the friction between the economic aspirations of the “new south” and the still powerful nostalgia of the old dominion, and it’s a drama that is playing out in town squares across the state. though a quinnipiac university poll last summer found virginians evenly divided on the governor’s decision to remove the confederate flag from state license plates, pride in local monuments remains strong. when city leaders in danville, on virginia’s southern border, voted to remove a confederate flag from the grounds of the sutherlin mansion—known as the last capitol of the confederacy—confederate preservationists struck back. they filed a lawsuit seeking to have the flag reinstated, arguing that it was part of a war memorial, and that virginia law protected all war memorials in the state. last fall, a circuit court judge ruled against them. that ruling—along with the increasingly frequent threats to monuments around the state—prompted the republican delegate from franklin county to demand in january a blanket protection for what has been a feature of southern urban landscapes for more than a century. charles poindexter introduced a bill in the general assembly to prevent the removal of all war monuments, regardless of when they were built. “if you eliminate these monuments and memorials, you’re taking away the opportunity to learn the history of the country—to learn the good, the bad and ugly,” poindexter says. many of his colleagues in the virginia legislature agreed with him. but in march, democratic governor terry mcauliffe vetoed the bill, saying cities and towns should decide what to do with their confederate monuments, based on their individual histories. some historians and civic leaders think the debate over confederate symbols in public spaces, which began in the 1960s, will take decades to play out. “every little statue’s a part of a much larger discussion and movement,” says edward ayers, former president of the university of richmond and noted civil war historian. “african-americans now have a political voice, and this is one of the things that they’re using it for.” *** mark whitaker remembers walking by the 30-foot-tall confederate monument in portsmouth, virginia, when he was a kid. shopping at a store across the street, he resented looking at the obelisk guarded by stone soldiers; his parents had told him what it represented. “my ancestors could not say a thing in the face of that indignity,” whitaker says. now, as an african-american city council member in a city that is 53 percent black, he wants to remove the monument from the center of olde towne, and perhaps put it in a cemetery. “these monuments are really a rally and a celebration [of] the rise of an institution that oppressed black people,” he says. many of the confederate monuments were built from the 1880s through the 1920s, an era when civil war veterans were dying and their descendants were eager to honor them. it was also the era immediately following reconstruction, when federal troops abandoned the south and whites aimed to reassert power through jim crow laws, lynchings and groups such as the ku klux klan. granite and marble monuments proclaimed that power, often in the center of town. but even in a majority-black city on the eastern shore of the state, whitaker has battled to get portsmouth’s monument removed. last summer, attorney fred taylor, who also represented confederate preservationists in the danville case, warned the city that state law prohibited it from moving the monument. “we believe the monument protection act covers the monument in danville, covers the monument in portsmouth,” taylor says. he argues that the original virginia statute protecting war monuments dates back to 1902, so “there has been protection all along.” when the circuit court judge ruled against him in danville, taylor appealed the case to the virginia supreme court. so far, the court has not agreed to hear the case. back in portsmouth, the debate continues. some residents don’t want the city to spend upward of $100,000 to move the monument—a position whitaker finds ridiculous. “why now, when we talk about moving a symbol of racism, we’re concerned about cost?” he says the portsmouth city council had been waiting to hear the outcome of the danville court case but could resume its discussion of the monument after the november elections. “we’re on solid legal grounds to remove it,” he says. “we just need four votes.” *** other virginia cities have struck a middle ground, forming committees to figure out what to do with their confederate monuments. in may, charlottesville convened a blue ribbon commission on race, memorials, and public spaces. although the move was sparked by a controversial statue of robert e. lee in a public park, mayor mike signer was determined to broaden the conversation, with an eye toward changing the city’s entire historic landscape. he asked the commission to look at several landmarks, from an african-american cemetery that had fallen into disrepair to the statue of a confederate boy in front of the courthouse. members of the panel have discussed rehabbing and creating new historic interpretations for these sites, building new monuments to african-american leaders and linking all the sites so that visitors can see how they are connected. there might even be a virtual, mobile educational component to help people navigate the sites. the goal, signer says, is to change the narrative of charlottesville “by telling the full story of race through our public spaces.” the commission is slated to give its recommendations to the city council in december. in the wealthy, heavily democratic city of alexandria, a similar advisory group decided not to remove the appomattox statue in the middle of old town, which depicts a defeated confederate soldier with his eyes downcast. the united daughters of the confederacy owns the monument, and moving it would require approval from the virginia general assembly. also, as the advisory group noted, appomattox is one of the rare confederate statues that marks a historic site—the place where the 17th virginia regiment gathered to withdraw from union occupation of the city in 1861. the group recommended labeling the statue with more historical context instead of taking it down. richmond, the former capital of the confederacy, has an entire street lined with monuments to confederate leaders. it’s also a majority-black city. in june 2015, someone scrawled “black lives matter” on the statue of former confederate president jefferson davis. yet mayor dwight jones has not called for the monuments’ removal. instead, he suggested adding more statues of prominent black leaders—such as the bronze of tennis legend arthur ashe, who was born in richmond, that the city erected in 1995. “rather than tearing down, we should be building up in ways that establish a proper sense of balance and fairness by recognizing heroes from all eras to tell a richer and more accurate story of virginia’s history,” jones said in a statement last summer. delegate poindexter tends to agree with jones, although he’s fuzzy on the specifics. asked whether he would be in favor of adding more historical context to existing confederate monuments, he says, “it’s far better than tearing down the current ones.” in his eyes, the era in which the confederate monuments were erected is “irrelevant.” “they need to be respected,” he says. “they didn’t know what we know today. that’s why these monuments are important.” ayers says many people who push to preserve confederate monuments share this attitude. “the white south has always been on the defensive ever since it tried to leave the united states,” he says. “they’ve taken what ground they can get, and what they can get is personal memory and memorialization. it’s an amalgam of power and weakness.” “they’re meant to do work,” ayers says. “the work that they were meant to do, in some ways they’re still doing: saying that this is a place where local white people call the shots.” *** in franklin county, the power struggle is deeply personal. stanley says the area sent about 3,000 confederate soldiers to what she calls “the war between the states.” veterans who returned home became mayors and town clerks and delegates. beginning in 1902, the local chapter of the united daughters of the confederacy started raising money for a memorial to honor the sons, fathers and husbands who never made it home. they dedicated the monument in front of the courthouse in 1910. one of the people who agreed to donate money to the project was booker t. washington, the famed african-american educator who was born into slavery on a farm in franklin county in 1856. in 1905, he wrote a letter offering to contribute funds for the confederate memorial, in honor of the family that owned him. as far as stanley knows, washington did contribute some amount, “we just don’t have a copy of the actual check.” poindexter says franklin county “lost hundreds of its best men” in the civil war, and for decades afterward, reconstruction was “a horrible process” that had a big impact on the region. today, franklin county is home to about 56,200 people, 90 percent of whom are white. they elected poindexter, a conservative christian with an “a” rating from the national rifle association, to the general assembly for the first time in 2007. in 2014, the county had a median household income of $44,827, far below the state’s median of $64,792. its residents voted republican in the past three presidential races, and many supported poindexter’s efforts to save war monuments. “we didn’t want anybody pulling any monuments down,” stanley says. soon after the county replaced the confederate memorial in front of the courthouse, the local chapter of the naacp suggested that a statue of booker t. washington be erected beside it. other community leaders wanted to put up a pedestal honoring african-americans who contributed to the county’s civil war effort. the county board of supervisors tabled their request, saying the community needed more time to discuss it. civil war memorials are not generally a big tourist draw in the roanoke region, says landon howard, president of visit virginia’s blue ridge. “to be candid, we really do not get hardly any american civil war visitation here.” yet locals have their own loyalties. every year, the franklin county historical society celebrates veterans memorial day, honoring all local casualties of military conflicts. according to the society’s website, “special emphasis is placed on veterans of the war between the states as this war touched literally every household in the county.” confederate general jubal early was born in franklin county, and he’s known as one of the rebels who never surrendered. “he became the primary spokesman for the lost cause and became the overwhelming authority on published confederate history,” says the website of the jubal a. early homeplace. speaking by phone from his farm in franklin county, poindexter isn’t ready to surrender, either. he doesn’t know whether he’ll propose his monument protection bill again next year, but he hasn’t ruled it out. “if you start tearing down monuments ... where do you stop?” he says. “you can’t change what was, but you can learn from it and not make that mistake again.”      monuments to the battle for the new south      
__label__0 democratic nominee hillary clinton holds a huge lead over rival donald trump among hispanic voters, according to a new wall street journal/nbc poll out thursday. among likely hispanic voters, clinton earns 65 percent of support compared to trump’s 17 percent, the poll finds. libertarian candidate gary johnson earned 9 percent while green party candidate jill stein has 2. story continued below a vast majority of hispanics surveyed – 8 in 10 – have negative views of the republican nominee. seven in 10 have “very negative” feelings of trump, according to the poll, while only 15 percent have a somewhat or very positive view of him. the results come as little surprise. early in the campaign, trump came under fire for calling hispanic immigrants “rapists” and criminals, for vowing to build a wall along america’s southern border and making mexico pay for it and for kicking well-known mexican-american journalist jorge ramos out of a press conference. more recently, he has pivoted on his stance on illegal immigration, saying that he’s open to softening laws on illegal immigration while also declaring there will be no amnesty for undocumented immigrants. the survey of 300 registered hispanic voters was conducted between sept. 15 and sept. 20, with a margin of error of plus or minus 5.66 percent.      poll: clinton has big lead over trump among hispanic voters      
__label__0 donald trump on thursday offered some advice to lester holt, who will moderate monday’s presidential debate between trump and hillary clinton: don’t be candy crowley. the republican presidential nominee suggested that the “nbc nightly news” anchor be a moderator, not a fact-checker, a recommendation that comes after nbc’s matt lauer faced intense criticism earlier this month after allowing trump’s assertion that he didn’t support the iraq war go unchecked. story continued below “well, i think he has to be a moderator,” trump told “fox and friends” of holt during a phone interview thursday morning. “i mean, you’re debating somebody and if she makes a mistake or i make a mistake, i’ll, you know, we’ll take each other on. but i certainly don’t think you want candy crowley again.” crowley, who moderated a 2012 debate at hofstra university, where trump and clinton will square off monday, attempted to fact check then-gop presidential nominee mitt romney, who said it took president barack obama 14 days to call the attack in benghazi, libya, an “act of terror.” “and she turned out to be wrong. i really don’t think you want that,” trump said. “that was a very pivotal moment in that debate. and it really threw the debate off and it was unfair. so i don’t think you want that. no, i think you have to have somebody that’s just — let them argue it out.” politifact later rated romney’s criticism “half true,” noting that obama did say “act of terror” right after the attacks but that the administration did not speak “consistently in the days that followed."      trump to debate moderator holt: we don’t want another candy crowley      
__label__0 donald trump on thursday pinned the blame for the turmoil in charlotte, north carolina, on president barack obama, suggesting that the violent protests there show a “wounded country” that “looks bad to the world.” pausing for roughly 10 minutes during an energy speech in pittsburgh to address the charlotte unrest, trump also presented himself as the man to heal america’s racial divide. story continued below “before going any further today, i want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country, and it seems to be a never-ending problem,” trump said. “america desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not really only got us through our toughest times, and we’ve had some tough times, but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.” he called for a swift end to violence against citizens and law enforcement, insisting that such actions hurt law-abiding african-american families most, and proposed a national anti-crime agenda to address what he characterized as a “national crisis.” he also vowed to make american cities safer by appointing “the best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers” and sympathized with police officers, who carry an “immense responsibility” but must be trained properly, respect the public and be held accountable for any wrongdoing. and he took a shot at obama’s leadership, or lack thereof. “we all have to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes, see things through their eyes and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. i mean, it’s — we have some real problems, and we do have a wounded country,” trump said. “many americans are watching the unrest in charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the tv screens. others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world’s leader. how can we lead when we can’t even control our own cities?” trump, who emphasized that it will be the 45th president’s responsibility “to address this crisis and save african-american lives,” has made an attempt to gain support from african-americans in recent weeks, albeit through a narrative of poorly educated, impoverished black people who live in crime-ridden inner cities and who, after years of democratic policies he says has failed them, have nothing to lose by supporting his campaign. trump's overtures to black voters — often made in front of overwhelmingly white audiences — have done little to dent hillary clinton's 80-point advantage among african- americans. and his sometimes ham-fisted appeals have come along with statements that have done himself further damage: only hours earlier, he recommended a controversial stop-and-frisk policy, a policing tactic that has been found to disproportionately targets minorities, to curb violence in chicago, obama's hometown, and made the unsubstantiated claim that “drugs are a very, very big factor” in what's happening in charlotte. still, trump has tried to cast himself as a unifying figure. earlier thursday, during a phone interview with “fox and friends,” the republican presidential nominee said there “just seems that there’s a lack of spirit between the white and the black.” “i mean, it’s a terrible thing that we’re witnessing,” he continued. “you’re seeing it. i'm seeing it, and you look at what went on last night in charlotte — a great place — and you just see it.” protests over the killing of keith lamont scott, a black man who was fatally shot by police on tuesday, turned violent on wednesday night, leading north carolina gov. pat mccrory to declare a state of emergency in charlotte. by thursday, charlotte officials and scott's family were arguing over whether he had been carrying a gun when he was shot. charlotte-mecklenburg police chief kerr putney told reporters that police believe scott was armed, though he acknowledged that a video of his encounter does not prove that conclusively. putney said the video would be shown to scott's family but did not commit to releasing it to the public. at a press conference thursday afternoon, attorneys for scott’s family refused to commit to calling for the video to be made public or to addressing the media after viewing it. charles monnett, one of the family’s lawyers, said the family's decision would depend on whether the video "can somehow help us reach that truth." justin bamberg, another of the family’s attorney’s, said he had not seen any evidence that a gun was present at the scene where scott was shot. bamberg dismissed photos showing a gun at the scene by remarking that “pictures pop up online all the time. they come from different sources.” he said that as far as he was aware, scott did not own a gun. bamberg also confirmed that scott’s wife was present when he was shot. “at the end of the day, my priority is the greater good of this family first. that has to be understood,” bamberg said when asked why the family’s legal team would not commit to calling for the video to be made public. “yes, we want transparency. we don't create the facts. we live with the facts. but you can't take the burden that is placed on law enforcement as sworn officers and public servants and put that on a deceased person for their family who is in mourning.” the obama administration, meanwhile, urged calm -- but the president himself had not made a statement as of 5:00 p.m. et on thursday. attorney general loretta lynch addressed the “difficulties” her home state faces but warned against any violent reactions. “i know that these are difficult times, and i know that the events of recent days are painfully unclear and they call out for answers,” she said. “but i also know that the answer will not be found in the violence of recent days. let us seek all peaceful way forward.” white house press secretary josh earnest said that the vast majority of people had demonstrated peacefully. “unfortunately, we've seen situations in which a small number of people take advantage of that peaceful public protest to engage in criminal activity and, in some cases, violence,” he said. “we've often heard from the families of those who were killed urging people with concerns to express those concerns peacefully and to not perpetuate the cycle of violence. those have often been quite powerful calls and those are calls that the president has strongly supported.” wednesday's violence erupted as residents, outraged over scott's death and that of an unarmed black man in tulsa, oklahoma, last week, looted and vandalized cars and businesses in downtown charlotte. according to reports, police in riot gear used tear gas to try to calm protesters, several of whom were injured, including one who was shot by another protester, police said. “i see it even going out. there’s such a lack of — there’s a lack of spirit,” trump said. “there’s a lack of something. something’s going on that’s bad, and what’s going on between police and others is getting worse.” the real estate mogul renewed his call for law and order, pitching it as the solution to the unrest in charlotte and outrage nationwide over police-involved shootings of black men, who in many cases have been unarmed when they were fatally shot. “well, it’s wow, here we go again,” trump said. “it’s very sad. when you look at what’s going on, it’s very sad. it’s very divided, our country, and it’s getting worse. i’m not overly surprised to see it, but it’s happening.” trump argued that a dialogue between police and the communities they serve won’t solve this problem, pointing to the ambush in dallas this summer, when a black man killed five officers and injured a dozen more. “if you look at dallas, there was a dialogue. they prided themselves on dialogue,” trump said. “and they were constantly talking and meeting and having community groups and, you know, that was — that was a pretty rough situation, to put it mildly. a terrible, terrible situation. that sounds good. it sounds right, but there’s something deeper than that.” what’s necessary, trump maintained, is a combination of law and order and leadership that can unify a divided nation, leadership he intimated is lacking from america’s current leader. “well, it really has to be — you have to have law and order at the time, you have to have, you know, you have to have a certain spirit, a certain unity, and there’s no unity,” trump said. “you look at the level of hatred, the, you know, the rocks being thrown and everything happening. it’s so sad to see. you know, this is the united states of america. i mean, it’s so sad to see. but there’s just no unity. there has to be a unity message that has to get out, and it starts with leadership.” but what trump didn’t say explicitly, his surrogates did. former house speaker newt gingrich and former new york mayor rudy giuliani appeared in separate fox news segments in which they both slammed obama’s lack of leadership. “first of all, it’s a tragedy that eight years after our first african-american president took office, eight years after we’ve had two african-american attorney generals, the gap and the hostility, if anything, is worse, and i think that’s a tragic failure of leadership,” gingrich said. “but my guess is he was afraid it’d make him a black president in a narrowing sense,” he added. “he could have launched a program to try to rebuild and reopen and re-engineer hope in these communities. and instead, he became the person who talked about, you know, the cambridge policeman was wrong, and, you know, ferguson was wrong and why florida was wrong.” giuliani said obama should have lectured americans on constitutional law wednesday. referring to last friday’s shooting death of terence crutcher, who was unarmed with his hands raised when he was fatally shot by a white police officer, the former new york mayor acknowledged that that incident was “a more difficult situation” than what transpired in charlotte that belongs in the “ambiguous, troubling category.” “but even there, you gotta say to people, ‘wait, let the investigation play out.’ the president of the united states should have said that yesterday,” giuliani said. “the president of the united states should have given people a teeny bit of a lecture on constitutional law, that we presume people innocent, and that same presumption exists for police officers as everyone else.”      trump hints obama to blame for charlotte unrest      
__label__0 republican study committee leaders are endorsing rep. andy harris to lead the conservative group in the next congress, picking the house freedom caucus member over freshman rep. mark walker. the rsc's founders, an influential group which consists of current chairman bill flores (r-texas), rep. sam johnson (r-texas) and previous leaders of the caucus, said while both harris (r-md.) and walker (r-n.c.) are qualified to serve as chairman, harris’ seniority in congress helped sway the decision. story continued below “while we determined that both candidates are qualified and would serve as effective chairs of the rsc, we believe that andy’s additional experience from serving three terms as a conservative leader in the house of representatives and his overall approach to serving his house colleagues will be beneficial to the organization,” the founders wrote in an announcement sent to rsc members obtained by politico. the founders' endorsement comes after some house freedom caucus members were threatening to abandon the rsc in recent weeks. the rsc is the largest caucus on capitol hill with 178 members, and because of that boasts considerable sway within the republican conference. the endorsement is signed by all of the group’s founders including johnson, flores, rep. jim jordan (r-ohio), leader of the house freedom caucus, house majority whip steve scalise (r-la.), rep. jeb hensarling (r-texas), rep. tom price (r-ga.) and rep. rob woodall (r-ga.). walker downplayed the endorsement and made clear he still wants the job. "at these crossroads of the conservative movement, i firmly believe that members need to be empowered to choose a direction for the rsc that is considered and adopted by the whole rsc – not based on a recommendation from a select few,” he said in a statement after the announcement.      conservatives back freedom caucus member for top post      
__label__0 more than a dozen members of the congressional black caucus marched down to the department of justice midday to demand federal intervention to stymie police shootings of unarmed african-americans. "the killing of unarmed black men and women by police is a crisis," said rep. maxine waters (d-calif.). story continued below the letter calls on lynch to “aggressively pursue investigations, indictments and prosecutions through the office of civil rights against any and all law enforcement officers who harm or kill innocent, unarmed black men, women and children.” cbc members said it’s also time for congress to act. “we are going to make sure that we push for legislation so we’re going to be calling on [house speaker] paul ryan to come up with some legislation that we can work on and put forward to change this. but in the meanwhile, we want the attorney general to utilize her powers,” rep. gregory meeks (d-n.y.). but other lawmakers said the proposals are already out there, they just need a push from leadership. "a lot of what we need has already been drafted, mostly by members of this caucus," said rep. cedric richmond (d-la.), specifically mentioning criminal justice reform and police accountability legislation. ryan (r-wis.) said earlier this week he still hopes to pass criminal justice reform in the lame duck. “i think people have lost trust, they’ve lost hope in some instances,” said charlotte rep. alma adams (d), who flew back from north carolina this morning. “they see hope here with the attorney general and they want her to step in to use her power to make sure people are treated fairly and there is some justice and there is some transparency,” she added. the members didn’t actually walk all the way from the capitol to doj headquarters, which is about a mile away. instead, lawmakers boarded a bus at the capitol and disembarked about two blocks from doj, walking the rest of the way.      black caucus marches to doj to protest shootings      
__label__0 the hacker website that leaked colin powell's politically embarrassing emails struck again thursday, this time releasing what appears to be the personal emails of a white house staffer working with hillary clinton’s campaign — and what purports to be an image of michelle obama’s passport. an initial scan of the messages appear to show chatter mostly regarding event planning details, such as requesting an invoice for a stage used at a clinton campaign event. in one exchange, the advanced planning team expresses concern that the media might notice a group of protesters at one event. story continued below the emails appear to be taken from the staffer's personal gmail account, and span from february 2015 to july of this year. a secret service spokeswoman said the agency was “aware of the alleged email hacking of a white house employee.” “the secret service is concerned any time unauthorized information that might pertain to one of the individuals we protect, or our operations, is allegedly disclosed,” spokeswoman nicole mainor told politico. “as a matter of policy, we do not provide information regarding investigations.” white house spokesman josh earnest declined to discuss the leak at his daily briefing. “administration officials are taking a look at the information that’s been disclosed,” earnest told reporters. “obviously we take any reports about a cyber breach seriously, particularly if it may include some sensitive information.” attorney general loretta lynch told reporters that the justice department is "aware of those media reports." "it is something that we're looking into," she said. according to a linkedin page, the staffer has worked as an advance associate for the white house since april 2015. the staffer also appears to work with the clinton campaign as an event organizer. the email dump was posted late wednesday on the purported anti-secrecy site dc leaks, which security experts have connected to the suspected russian cyberattack campaign targeting u.s. political institutions and state election offices. most notably, the site has also posted the pilfered private emails of powell, as well as the alleged communications of other clinton campaign workers and a few republican lawmakers who have been critical of the russian regime, including sens. john mccain and lindsey graham. early on thursday, the dc leaks twitter account posted the purported image of michelle obama's passport. the emails may have been stolen during a previously reported cyberattack campaign that targeted at the personal email accounts of at least 26 clinton campaign staffers and volunteers. digital forensic experts have tied that digital assault to the same russian hacking group that is believed to have also infiltrated other top democratic institutions, including the democratic national committee. eric geller contributed to this report.      powell leakers strike again with alleged white house staffer emails, michelle obama passport      
__label__0 hillary clinton is looking to channel some more barack obama magic — although she promises not to incite a civil war if her strategy doesn't work. "i wouldn't take up arms. that might be a little extreme," clinton told zach galifianakis on between two ferns, a mock interview show hosted by the comedian, when asked what she'd do if she lost the presidential election. clinton added that if her quest for the white house were to fail she would stay in the country to try to prevent donald trump from "destroying the united states." story continued below some analysts credit the president's march 2014 appearance on between two ferns with helping boost enrollment in obamacare right when his administration needed it the most. and in an episode posted thursday, clinton decided to see if it could boost her campaign. her team has admitted that is struggling to reach millennials, a demographic ripe for the show's humor. joking about those who have questioned her judgment in recent days, clinton said her appearance would probably prove her detractors right. as with obama, galifianakis left few topics untouched. he riffed on clinton’s time as secretary of state. “how does obama like his coffee?” he asked before questioning how many words per minute clinton could muster. galiafinakis also made light of clinton's recent bout of pneumonia and questioned just how on earth she lost scott baio's vote to donald trump. "you know, zach, those are really out-of-date questions, you need to get out more," clinton retorted when asked blatantly sexist questions. "i could send you some pamphlets." the 46-year-old comedian also snuck in a 1990s hip-hop reference on the trans pacific partnership trade deal, asking clinton if she was “down with tpp.” the democratic nominee helped pave the way for the agreement as secretary of state, but now opposes it. but the sharpest moments came at the expense of clinton’s opponent. asked what tie donald trump might wear to the first presidential debate on monday night, clinton said probably a red power one. but when galifianakis asked how a “white power tie” would fit, clinton joked that such a hue might be more appropriate. in another dig at trump, galifianakis said the show was sponsored by the new york businessman — courtesy of the now discontinued trump steaks. clinton said she would be “afraid to eat them.” galifianakis ended the interview by asking: "what's the best way to reach you? email?"      clinton, hoping to reach millennials, submits to mockery on 'between two ferns'      
__label__0 a decade ago, the u.s. census counted 15 people living in roanoke’s downtown. if the world knew anything about the city of 100,000 in southwest virginia, it was likely because of the massive illuminated star beaming down from a nearby mountain, a sad reminder of a long-ago era when holiday shoppers, bearing paychecks from the railroad that dominated the local economy, thronged the downtown department stores. story continued below now roanoke is back on the map, with people at home and away starting to talk about it in a way they haven’t since the 1880s, when the “magic city” sprang up out of nearly nowhere around a new railway interchange like some far west gold-mining town. the downtown has been revitalized and, for the first time in its history, has 2,000 people living in it, many of them getting to and from other parts of the city via a refurbished greenbelt. a highly competitive medical school and world-class, $77 million research institute with a top-notch neuroscience program have both sprung up near the hospital, and the institute is about to double its size. people from the outside world—attracted by the beauty of the surrounding blue ridge and allegheny mountains—are moving in, reversing a 30-year population decline. schools are good, violent crime is at a half-century low, and a public broadband network just doubled internet speeds. passenger rail service to washington’s union station is making its return, and a tourism industry is flourishing where none existed before. the latest bit of good news, oregon-based deschutes brewery, the eighth-largest craft brewery in the country, announced in march that it had chosen roanoke for the site of its $85 million east coast hub, bringing an initial 108 jobs. “up until 2005, it was always, ‘woe is us, and it’s so bad, and there was this star, which was kind of an embarrassment,’” recalls beth doughty, executive director of the roanoke regional partnership, which markets the region to potential investors. “now there’s a groundswell of love for the place, of community pride. we’re celebrating that star.” how did a small city in a disadvantaged region four hours from a major metropolis—one that had seen its signature industries atrophy or depart, that lacked so much as a branch campus of a state university—transform itself from the forgotten stepsister of the appalachians into a formidable rival to asheville, north carolina? the answer has lessons for small, out-of-the-way cities everywhere: roanoke’s people did it largely by themselves, in small steps and with an eye to assets and alliances in the wider region around them. “at some point we realized that we may never have the white knight come in with a volkswagen auto plant and give us a quick win,” says lisa garst, a former city councilor in neighboring salem who now heads livable roanoke valley, a nonprofit that aims to engage citizens, governments and businesses in a regional planning process. “we realized what’s going to happen is going to come from people who are already invested here, know the value of the area and can stick it out for a 20-, 30- or 40-year time frame.” and it all happened in what would seem the most unlikely of places: a city created, built and controlled for most of its history by the distant investors of that most controlling and rapacious of industrial age corporations, the railroad. *** virginia may be the site of the first successful english colony and cradle of presidents, but roanoke is an extremely young city. in 1881—when philadelphia was about to celebrate its bicentennial and there were 61,000 people living in richmond—what’s now downtown roanoke was nothing but fields, cow pastures and marsh a mile and a half west of the village of big lick, population 650. in february of that year, e.w. clark & company of philadelphia dispatched surveyors to roanoke county to find the best spot to build a hub that would connect the two railroads it had acquired: the shenandoah valley railroad (which was expanding north to south) and the norfolk & western (which ran east to west). big lick’s businessmen offered the company $10,000, a free acre of land and tax exemptions if it would build the hub in their hamlet. the company agreed, took the incentives, and, to the locals’ surprise, began construction of a brand new community not in their hamlet but a mile and a half to the east near the foot of mill mountain. they named it roanoke (because “big lick” just wouldn’t do) and within weeks it dwarfed the older village and would soon spread west and absorb it. in a matter of months, clark & company’s subsidiaries laid out a new street grid on the banks of the rail line and constructed 128 houses, a depot, shops, iron works, railroad offices and the grand hotel roanoke, which has served as the city’s central landmark ever since. demographers define “boomtowns” as having a 15 percent annual growth rate. in the first decade after the company’s arrival, roanoke’s population increased an average of 290 percent a year and the city became virginia’s third biggest after richmond and norfolk. the speed of the growth meant a certain lack of polish. the hartford courant’s correspondent found “streets of temporary wooden shops and dwellings, drinking shops and ‘hotels’ with false board fronts hiding the upper half stories and big letter signs after the manner of the west.” as in the instant cities of the far west, there were drunken fights in the saloons and brothels, unpaved roads that turned to mud when it rained and reeking open sewers beside wood sidewalks. “the town,” the baltimore sun reported, “suggests a mining camp or a mushroom city of colorado.” roanoke’s ribald reputation chastened company officials, motivating their wives to organize civic improvement efforts in the first decade of the 20th century, culminating in their contracting celebrated landscape architect john nolen to the city in 1907. nolen, a student of frederick law olmsted jr., is generally credited with being the father of american city planning, and for roanoke he created what was the nation’s first comprehensive city plan. nolen, who had been raised in an orphanage and had a rather un-victorian empathy for the poor, was appalled that the city had “no public gardens, parks, parkways, no playground, no attractive school yards, no monuments, no public library, no open plazas or public squares … and no public buildings of distinction.” he found the living conditions in the african-american neighborhood—home to a third of the population—completely unacceptable. his plan called for comprehensive investments throughout roanoke, including a network of parks, a river walk along the roanoke river, playgrounds in every ward, a grand city hall and library, and the purchase of mill mountain for the public, a resource he likened to mount royal in montreal. the plan, he said, would turn roanoke into the “most attractive city in the state if not the entire country.” but the city fathers didn’t like the idea of investing in black neighborhoods, and voters rejected even a scaled-down bond issue. nolen’s plan was put on the shelf. many of its recommendations would wait a century to be implemented. *** for the next half-century, roanoke settled into a comfortable company-town pattern, with the norfolk & western dominating the civic scene and the regional economy through its ownership of 400,000 acres of appalachian coal country. the railway built its own locomotives and rolling stock near the town center, underwrote the construction of a hospital at the foot of mill mountain and donated land for parks and churches. the city remained sharply segregated, with african-americans maintaining their own commercial and entertainment district right into the 1960s, when much of it was demolished in the name of “urban renewal.” by then, roanoke had begun to feel the same forces undermining cities across the country. federally subsidized superhighways tore through neighborhoods and funneled people to new homes in far-flung suburbs. department stores, shops, restaurants and hotels followed them, eroding the tax base and the vitality of downtown. “by the mid-1970s, downtown roanoke was in sad shape,” says dwayne yancey, editorial page editor of the roanoke times. “the old farmer’s market in its heart was a bad place—hookers, transvestites, dealers, all manner of shady characters. decent people didn’t go there.” educator anita price, who is african-american, arrived around this time from baltimore, following her husband back to his home city. “i was depressed for two years because i looked around and thought, ‘oh, lord, how am i going to give my children a good education, give them the cultural environment that we’re used to in this area that looks absolutely devoid of any amenities?’” recalls price, who is now vice-mayor. “it was segregated, the downtown was lily-white, and i saw no minority professionals. these things really concerned me.” the city council, deadlocked by factional differences—partisan, racial and parochial—couldn’t take action. “they would argue with each other instead of doing strategic planning, like the federal congress now,” says retired bank executive warner dalhouse, who rallied city luminaries to do something about it. “downtown was becoming a ghost town, but we believed it was the beating heart of the whole roanoke valley, the city lights of the whole western part of the state.” in 1975, dalhouse and his colleagues saw an opening: the city had annexed a large chunk of county territory and, in order to give the new residents fair representation, a judge had ordered the entire city council, mayor and vice-mayor to go up for reelection, all at once. “it looked to several of us like a historic opportunity because you could elect a new council and get diversity and business expertise and energy and progressive ideas and mutual agreement all at the same time,” dalhouse says. they drafted a bipartisan dream team—including preacher noel taylor (who would later become one of the first african-american mayors elected in a predominantly white southern city) and nick taubman, son of the founder of advance auto parts—ran them as the “roanoke forward” party, and raised the then unheard-of sum of $90,000 to promote their candidacies. “it was a landslide,” dalhouse recalls of the 1976 vote. “we elected all seven.” roanoke has a strong city-manager form of government, and the dream team hired a young, energetic outsider for the position, bern ewert, who had to leave his previous gig in stratford, connecticut, after blowing the whistle on a bribery scheme. “in roanoke, the charge from them to me was very broad: integrate the city workforce, improve city relations, rebuild the neighborhoods and downtown, and lower taxes,” recalls ewert, who was 35 when he arrived just after new year’s in 1978. “and when you finished all that, come back and talk to us.” the fact that past bond issues to do such things had been shot down by voters didn’t make the task any easier. nor did the local preference for demolishing historic buildings rather than renovating them, as ewert proposed. but ewert gathered up his courage and did what nobody had previously dared to do. he went to jack fishwick, president of the norfolk & western, a man who determined the fate of entire counties in the kentucky and west virginia coal country but didn’t participate in city politics because, as ewert puts it “they were so powerful they were afraid they’d skew things. i was scared of him, like everyone else was.” but he made his pitch: to save downtown, they needed his support. fishwick agreed and, like magic in the magic city, winds began filling the reformer’s sails. the local cbs television affiliate agreed to give ewert’s team two prime-time slots a week to present and solicit public ideas and preferences for the revitalization of downtown, an effort called design 79. a local department store gave his staff a storefront where they collected thousands of ideas and suggestions from more spotlight-averse citizens. “the idea was to get as many citizens involved as we possibly could,” dalhouse says. “by the time it got to a vote”—for the $15.5 million bond issue to move forward—“literally thousands were invested in it.” the resulting plan was modular, so it could be tackled piece by piece, and included revamping the historic city market building as a food emporium, adding benches, trees and awnings to the surrounding farmers market, expanding the library and a downtown park, building parking garages and connecting downtown and the hotel roanoke with a new pedestrian bridge over the busy rail corridor. the centerpiece was a rehabilitation of a large 1920s commercial building on market square to serve as the new rent-free home of several area museums and theaters. “we knew we needed a magnet—the equivalent of an anchor store at a shopping center—to attract people to the center,” ewert recalls. the referendum passed on the first try, with a 55 percent majority. the joint museum space, center on the square, was an instant hit, with 40,000 visitors on its opening weekend in 1983. “that was a real red-letter date,” says yancey of the times. “it gave people a reason to go there; restaurants and businesses followed, and the trend line has just continued from there.” but just as downtown was flickering back to life as an entertainment district, the rest of the city was reeling from a body blow to its identity from which it took two decades to recover. *** the shocking announcement came on an early spring day in 1982. the norfolk & western, which had been based in the city since its foundation, was merging with a d.c.-based rival and moving its headquarters to norfolk, 240 miles away. the new norfolk southern would shed 1,500 local jobs—a third of the total and including many clerical positions—beginning a long, slow retreat from the city it had built. “in those days, they didn’t give you three weeks of media chatter beforehand, they just made an announcement and boom!” says doughty, who worked for a local public relations firm at the time. “we were pretty happy, content and self-satisfied being a railroad town, so that was quite a kick in the pants for the community and the region.” the blows kept coming. the railroad closed the hotel roanoke, now a tudor-style, 382-room edifice and as much a symbol of the town as the mill mountain star, shutting off its fountains and dispatching liquidators to sell off its furnishings. “to see that place closed with a chain link around it was just more bad news,” says ray smoot, a veteran administrator at virginia tech, 35 miles to the west in blacksburg. not long thereafter, the railroad abandoned its grand headquarters building down the hill from the hotel. people looked to the local banking powerhouse, dominion, to fill the void, only to have it absorbed by a charlotte rival in 1992. “it really set up a decade of civic angst,” says yancey. “if we’re not a railroad town and we’re not a banking town, what are we?” but the marginalization of traditional power had a silver lining, observes ed walker, a native son who was attending washington & lee university school of law, an hour to the northeast, at the time. “everybody used to pack up their briefcases and go to the railroad and the bank to see if they could build this museum or do x, y or z,” he says. “now there was nowhere to go to anymore. the city had to look to itself. and that created a power vacuum that let some talented and interesting and unexpected change agents come forward and try things that never could have happened when i was growing up.” the first such agent was a very large one, virginia tech, a public research university in the next valley to the west that had never had much to do with roanoke. “virginia tech did not at the time have a first-class hotel or conference center on its campus in blacksburg,” says smoot, then the ceo of the virginia tech foundation, the university’s investment arm. “and there was the iconic hotel roanoke sitting there empty.” the railroad agreed to donate the hotel to the university foundation, which allied with city officials and local civic leaders to raise $28 million to completely rehabilitate the structure, while the city put up $14 million to build a conference center wing, which opened in 1995. “that’s the thing that began virginia tech’s relationship with roanoke,” smoot says. a decade later, that relationship would move into overdrive, transforming both parties. other higher education institutions in the region—from roanoke college in salem to the virginia community college system—partnered with civic leaders and the state to turn the old norfolk & western headquarters building into a higher education center, where various institutions could offer classes, continuing education and workforce training. “we’re going to change this town from a blue-collar town into a university town,” retired norfolk & southern chief fishwick proclaimed during this era. “i think it’s the greatest thing to happen in roanoke in my lifetime.” the center enrolls 2,800 students at a time, and by 2010 was estimated to be boosting the local economy by $32 million. meanwhile, a deteriorating sewer line winding along the overgrown and ignored banks of the roanoke river was wearing out, requiring that the city establish a right of way to properly replace it. a local nonprofit, the valley beautiful foundation, introduced city leaders to the greenway concept in john nolen’s 1907 plan: a riverside park with walking or biking trails connecting the city’s districts. slowly, starting in the late 1990s, a greenway expanded along the new sewer lines, eventually to extend into a 285-mile network crisscrossing the valley between the appalachian trail to the north and the blue ridge parkway to the south. they were immediately popular. “we had problems with trying to keep people off the greenways until we finished constructing them,” recalls darlene burcham, who was city manager during much of the build-out. “people could live in one place and work in another and not have to get in their car.” *** as the greenways expanded, walker, by then a young, third-generation attorney doing due diligence reviews for businesses, was getting frustrated with the creative and financial limits of his profession, which was not always in alignment with his desire to effect positive social change. he had helped open the downtown music lab, a nonprofit providing at-risk teens a place to play and record music (musician dave matthews was among the donors), but it was a project assigned to him by dalhouse, the retired bank executive, that showed him another path. “i had early on identified walker as a talent and had decided to give him some nudging in one direction or another,” dalhouse says. a historic movie palace in roanoke’s declining grandin village neighborhood was up for sale, and local do-gooders needed help raising $1.6 million to buy and rehabilitate it as a community theater. his instincts about walker were spot on. “i just had this epiphany about the incredible convening power of real estate,” recalls walker, who was amazed by how quickly people and money rallied around the project. “nothing moves faster than community-minded capital with investing in a community’s real estate. you can take the status quo and change it immediately.” anchored by the theater, the grandin neighborhood promptly bounced back and is now one of the city’s most desirable areas. so, in 2002, walker quit the law and embarked on a series of profitable, but socially minded, redevelopments in the heart of the city, a place design 79 had shored up as an entertainment and a shopping district but where a grand total of 15 people actually lived, most of them in apartments above their ground-floor place of business. the first was the stately 10-story colonial american bank building, which he and a partner purchased for $1.4 million in 2003 and renovated as upscale condos ranging in size from 3,000 to 4,800 square feet. walker’s family moved into the top floor and his partner into another condo, and dalhouse purchased a third (which he and his wife live in today), prompting other well-heeled buyers to follow suit. walker then bought the former grand piano and furniture company block nearby and, with the help of historic tax credits and an $880,000, no-interest loan from the city housing authority, converted it into 58 mixed-income apartments. “condos were one thing, but it was largely unknown how many people would pay rent to live down here,” walker says. to his shock, the entire building was leased on opening day. “everybody looked at each other and said, ‘what just happened?’” since then, walker has helped develop kirk avenue, which runs behind the city market area, as a restaurant and arts corridor, including a music hall that offers traveling bands free loft accommodations upstairs; transformed the decaying patrick henry hotel into a mixed commercial and residential space with 134 apartments and a restored ballroom; and purchased a beloved local radio station to prevent it from abandoning its funky indie-folk-country format. he’s also donated a park and playground in grandin village, and developed inexpensive condos in a former cotton mill in another part of the city and a large riverfront property that now houses an enormous rock climbing gym. combined, his projects to date run to some $70 million and 600,000 square feet. he founded an annual conference—cityworks (x)po—that draws 350 experts to roanoke to discuss “big ideas for small cities.” “ed’s a very unusual developer in that he didn’t want to make a lot of money and run, but was more interested in the long-term benefit to the community,” says burcham, the former city manager. “he realized we needed various income levels of housing, and he did that.” by the late aughts, downtown was taking on a 24/7 vibe, with more shops, businesses and eateries moving in to cater to residents, who numbered in the hundreds and total more than 2,000 today. a local art museum, having outgrown center on the square as the result of a large bequest, raised $66 million to build the new, 85,000-square-foot taubman museum of art two blocks away, which opened in 2008. even with the great recession that kicked off later that year, the city moved forward with step-by-step investments: two new high schools, an award-winning renovation of the main library, the revamping of a downtown park and amphitheater (which reopened with a concert by sheryl crow), and the continued expansion of trails and bike paths. “hail mary passes—going after the one big thing—often fail,” says chris morrill, a past president of the government finance officers association, who has been city manager since 2010. “you go for rapid incrementalism. you figure out where you want to go and you just keep moving: market building, new park, greenways, plaza, reopening the formal entrance of city hall. you keep the momentum going and eventually all the naysayers say, ‘how did we get here?’” beth doughty of the regional partnership agrees. “people want economic development to be a silver bullet, but it’s not. it’s like spinning plates,” she says. “no one person or entity is responsible for all of the plates, but you do want them all spinning at the same time.” but roanoke still had a problem: what did it want to be? *** despite the progress, the city remained in an identity crisis through the 1990s and well into the aughts, disheartened that it had been left behind by upland southern rivals such as asheville and charlotte. “i was asked from the day i arrived, ‘what is your vision of the city?’” says burcham, who was city manager from 2000 to early 2010. “i said it’s not my vision, it’s the community’s vision, but everybody needs to get away from the idea that the goal was to be charlotte, that if we didn’t get a particular airline coming here we were doomed.” meanwhile, the board of the roanoke regional partnership—a joint venture of regional city and county governments that spent much of its time trying to lure northeastern manufacturers to the region—decided it wanted to also focus on improving the area’s competitiveness. “talent is the currency of the 21st century, and we needed to be more concerned about attracting it,” says doughty, who left her position as head of the regional chamber of commerce in 2008 to take on the task. essential to that was finding a new narrative the community could embrace, she says, and it became clear to her what it was. “if you asked people what’s the best thing about roanoke, they would say, ‘the mountains, they’re so beautiful,’” she says. “but they talked about them like they were wallpaper. if we could embrace the idea we were an outdoors city, we could monetize the outdoors and really strengthen the region’s real advantage, its livability.” the partnership hired a full-time outdoor branding guru, pete eshelman, who set about building partnerships with governments, businesses, nonprofits, and state and federal park authorities to extend trails, reopen whitewater rafting destinations, improve fishing and launch america’s toughest marathon, an annual event so-called because running it involves a 7,400-foot ascent. he’s helped organize professional road-cycling events, get a top bmx rider to develop a plan for an action sports park and raise money to build new canoe ramps and kayak park on the river. “this could only work if we had buy-in from the community, so it had to be real and true,” eshelman says. “now when they travel somewhere and talk with people about what roanoke is like, an outdoor narrative is going to be part of the description, and that wasn’t the case before.” simultaneously, the region’s visitor promotion agency, which previously focused on getting conventions to come to town, began marketing the area as “virginia’s blue ridge,” a place of scenic beauty and outdoor adventure with a happening city in the middle. as a result, over the past five years travel spending has grown by more than a fifth, and hotel revenue by 25 percent. more visitors are coming—creating 600 more jobs—but the real goal of the effort is to get some of them to decide to come back and put down roots. “this is more than just tourism; this is workforce development, because we’re competing for world talent,” says landon howard, the agency’s president. a good thing, too, because suddenly roanoke needed to recruit a lot of very talented people very quickly to partake in the most consequential undertaking since e.w. clark & company showed up back during chester arthur’s presidential administration. *** there’s been a hospital at the foot of mill mountain since 1900, when railroad officials decided they needed a place for injured workers to be treated. the current incarnation, roanoke memorial, was by the early 21st century the flagship of a sprawling nonprofit hospital network, a fleet of air ambulances and the only level i trauma center in the western half of the state. the network, carilion, was financially sound, but changes in how health care providers are reimbursed required that it shift its focus from managing hospitals to improving health outcomes across the surrounding communities, a clinic model that required a hiring bonanza, including a quadrupling of its physician staff. but how to recruit and retain so many highly skilled people to come to the mountains of southwestern virginia? an essential component would be to open a medical school in roanoke, an attractive feature for many of medicine’s best and brightest, recalls nancy agee, then carilion’s chief operations officer and now its ceo. “it creates a different vibe and helps satisfy the sense of curiosity that many of the best and brightest physicians have,” she says. “we could do it ourselves, but wouldn’t it make more sense to find a partner?” by good fortune, a partner was close at hand. down at virginia tech, president charles steger had challenged his institution to grow from a lower-50-ranked research university to one of the top 30 by 2013, a move that would require moving into fields funded by the national institutes of health. “we didn’t have a human medicine school, but we did have a lot of experience with technology transfer and research-related entrepreneurship,” says smoot, the virginia tech administrator. “so a conversation began with carilion.” the result was two joint ventures to be built in 2010 on what had been an old industrial site on the way from the hospital to downtown roanoke: an elite, research-intensive medical school and a biomedical research institute with world-class aspirations. they approached michael friedlander, then chair of the neuroscience department at one of the nation’s leading and largest medical research institutions, the baylor college of medicine at houston’s texas medical center, to head the institute. “i only knew where roanoke was because for some reason it was the place the weather channel gave for the region’s temperatures,” he says. “but they said you are going to get to build from scratch an innovative biomedical research enterprise and you can pretty much build it around your vision. and of course, you don’t often get offered stuff like that. it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” friedlander took the job but knew the greatest challenge would be attracting top people from established institutions like texas medical center, which had more employees (105,000) than roanoke had people. “i had been struck by the natural beauty of the place and by the people’s pride in it and wanting to make it work,” he says. “most academic medical centers in the u.s. are in not-so-great parts of major cities. here we’re right next to a major health center with one of the top 12 busiest emergency departments in the country and you can go out at lunch time and be pulling trout out of the roanoke river in hip waders.” if he could get people to visit, friedlander thought, he would have a shot. his fishing expedition worked. today, the virginia tech carilion research institute has some of the top researchers in neuroscience working on everything from the decision-making patterns of drug addicts to the use of brain imaging in psychiatry. it will break ground soon on a $66 million expansion that will double the number of research teams to 50. the medical school next door is also research intensive, with the unusual requirement that students undertake a research project of publishable quality. although the institution is only six yers old, this year it had 4,600 applications for 42 spots. commercial research spinoffs are beginning to populate the downtown side of the complex, an area being promoted as the innovation corridor. “we’ve gone from a train city to a brain city,” says mayor sherman lea, who, like the vice-mayor, circuit court clerk, school board chair and other city-wide elected officials, is african-american. (“when you have a city with less than 30 percent african-americans in the mountains next to tennessee, you wouldn’t think that. but that’s how we’ve changed,” he says of the electorate’s choices.) and soon it will be a beer city as well, having lured deschutes here instead of long-envied asheville and 48 other cities the brewery considered up and down the east coast. deschutes chief financial officer peter skrbek says he was drawn by logistics and clean water, the strong public schools and an outdoorsy culture akin to the company’s home in bend, oregon. “but the biggest thing was just being wanted by the community and their enthusiasm for us to come there each time we would visit,” he says. “i’ve never seen such enthusiasm for a company’s investment.” when the deschutes news broke, one industry publication declared roanoke the new asheville. over at the roanoke times, yancey’s editorial responded: “we’d gently beg to differ,” he wrote. “we’re the new roanoke.”      trains built roanoke. science saved it.      
__label__0 donald trump doubled down on his call for implementation of stop-and-frisk thursday — but only in chicago. the republican presidential nominee suggested the controversial stop-and-frisk policy to mitigate violent crime in america’s inner cities during an interview with fox news’ sean hannity broadcast wednesday evening. story continued below on thursday, he clarified that he was only referring to enacting it in chicago, where he said more than 3,000 shootings have taken place this year. “i was really referring to chicago with stop-and-frisk,” he told “fox and friends” during a phone interview thursday morning. “they asked me about chicago and i was talking about stop-and-frisk for chicago.” but while trump scaled down where stop-and-frisk should be deployed, the self-proclaimed law-and-order candidate hardly softened his stance on the policing practice that studies have shown is biased. he cited new york, where a federal court ruled the practice unconstitutional in 2013 because it disproportionately impacts people of color (though an appeals court overturned the ruling, and the city eventually settled), as evidence that it works. “i mean, the numbers were unbelievably changed,” he said of crime statistics before and after new york implemented stop-and-frisk. “i don’t mean just a little bit. it was massively changed, and it became a safe city. it went from an unsafe city to a safe city.” trump highlighted chicago as a city that’s “out of control” right now but where stop-and-frisk is a necessity that can save the city from itself, suggesting it’s more dangerous to be there than in war-torn nations like afghanistan. “i think chicago needs stop-and-frisk,” trump said. “now, people can criticize me for that or people can say whatever they want, but they asked me about chicago, and i think stop-and-frisk, with good, strong, you know, good, strong law and order. but you have to do something. it can’t continue the way it’s going.” david axelrod, a former senior adviser to president barack obama, blasted trump’s “problematic” rhetoric — even if he was only referring to chicago. “that’s like taking a can of kerosene and pouring it over a fire,” he said of trump’s call for stop-and-frisk during an interview with cnn. “it wasn’t what was needed.” trump shared his denotation of the term, first explaining that “there are different levels” to stop-and-frisk. “basically, they will, if they see poss… — you know, they’re proactive, and if they see a person possibly with a gun or they think may have a gun, they will see the person, and they’ll look and they’ll take the gun away,” trump said. “they’ll stop, they’ll frisk, and they’ll take the gun away, and they won’t have anything to shoot with. i mean, how it’s not being used in chicago is, to be honest with you, it’s quite unbelievable. and, you know, the police, the local police, they know who has a gun, who shouldn’t be having a gun. they understand that.” trump’s definition, however, excluded any racial bias — at a time when the nation is already reeling from a series of fatal shootings of black men at the hands of police officers just days apart, marked by unrest in charlotte, north carolina, where gov. pat mccrory declared a state of emergency wednesday evening. former new york mayor rudy giuliani, a trump surrogate, hailed the practice as a strategy that reduced crime and is the solution to reducing gun violence. “because it takes the gun right out of your hand,” said giuliani, who added that no one is taking guns away in new york or chicago “because bad guys don’t go register” guns. “you know, ‘fat tony’ salerno doesn’t go get a gun permit. neither does the hood on the street go get a permit,” he continued. “you know why? there’s probably a warrant for his arrest and he’s gonna go to jail. so he doesn’t get a permit.” trump contended that “you can’t let the system go the way it’s going,” adding that “some people” think stop-and-frisk is “a great idea, and some people probably don’t like it” — new york mayor bill de blasio is of the latter group. de blasio condemned stop-and-frisk, insisting that it “created a real wedge between police and community and created division.” de blasio credited “a systematic strategic approach to policing,” not stop-and-frisk, for reduced crime in new york. “you know, donald trump talks about stop-and-frisk like he knows the facts. he has had no experience with policing, no experience with public safety,” de blasio told cnn. “he should really be careful because if we reinstituted stop-and-frisk all over this country, you would see a lot more tension between police and community.” white house press secretary josh earnest declined to respond to trump's comments. "i think it does raise questions that a politician would be so dogmatic about protecting second amendment rights yet rather cavalier about protecting the constitutional prohibition against an illegal search and seizure," he said. "it might lead one person to conclude that the politician is more interested in playing politics than finding a solution." but earnest made sure to note that stop-and-frisk is not the type of practice the administration and its allies support. "expanding and doubling down on stop and frisk policies is not among the suggestions, i think for rather obvious reasons." brent griffiths contributed to this story.      trump clarifies stop-and-frisk: i only meant chicago      
__label__0 former house speaker newt gingrich praised donald trump's outreach to inner cities in an appearance on fox news on thursday morning. "the core problem is that people are trapped in the neighborhoods with no hope, no future, no jobs. there have been over 3,000 people shot in chicago so far this year. one every two hours," gingrich said, adding, "one thing i'll say about trump, he's the first conservative i've seen willing to go into the inner city and talk about the need for dramatic change." story continued below gingrich, a trump supporter, criticized democratic leadership in inner cities, and suggested barack obama could have done more as president to diffuse racial tensions in the country. when asked how obama may have missed an opportunity to repair race relations, he said, "i think the biggest aspect was that all of the major inner cities, all of them governed by democrats, are all disasters," citing statistics reflecting low primary school passing rates in several cities. "more americans have been killed while obama was president, in chicago, than in iraq and afghanistan combined. and i think the president had a unique opportunity, but my guess is he was afraid it would make him a black president in a narrowing sense," he said.      gingrich: trump is the first conservative to go into the inner city and talk change      
__label__0 former defense secretary donald rumsfeld defended his endorsement of gop nominee donald trump, when prodded, by suggesting that the republican nominee is “not untruthful.” rumsfeld, who served as defense secretary under presidents gerald ford and george w. bush, offered his reasoning on supporting trump over hillary clinton in an interview with msnbc that aired thursday: “i look at it and say, i don’t agree with either of them 100 percent of the time, but who do i think would be best for the country, and what do i think is acceptable?” story continued below “maybe not preferred. but acceptable, as opposed to what’s unacceptable, and i think truthfulness and believability and,” rumsfeld said, pausing before concluding: “truthfulness is important.” msnbc’s stephanie ruhle followed up, asking, “you think he’s truthful?” “i think he's not untruthful,” rumsfeld elaborated. “and i think she is.” according to recent polling, both candidates face the perception among many voters that they are dishonest, and clinton has grappled with voters’ belief that she is untrustworthy, fueled by criticisms over her use of a private email server as secretary of state. but trump, too, has repeatedly made false statements on the campaign trail, to the point that some critics have accused him of propagating conspiracy theories. he only last week backed down from his false claim that president barack obama was not born in the united states. ruhle also asked rumsfeld about reports that former president george h. bush plans to vote for clinton, rather than trump, in november. rumsfeld said he’s not surprised, and asked why, rumsfeld replied, “he’s up in years.” “so are you,” ruhle said back. rumsfeld elaborated: “he's up in years, and he obviously comes from a totally different cut than donald trump, and he gets his choice.”      rumsfeld on george h.w. bush voting for clinton: ‘he’s up in years’      
__label__0 hillary clinton holds a narrow lead over donald trump among likely voters in north carolina, a new york times upshot/siena college poll released thursday morning shows. with just 47 days to go until november’s general election, the former secretary of state leads the manhattan billionaire in a head-to-head matchup by two points, 45 percent to 43 percent. that advantage for clinton sits within the poll’s 3.6 percentage point margin of error. story continued below but in a three-way race that also includes libertarian gary johnson, clinton and trump are tied at 41 percent. the former new mexico governor polled at 11 percent. jill stein, the green party candidate for president, is not on the ballot in north carolina. support for the two major party candidates breaks down largely along racial lines, with trump leading clinton among white likely voters, 56 percent to 30 percent. the former secretary of state holds a formidable advantage with the state’s african-american population, leading 91 percent to 4 percent. the times’ poll was released one day after a fox news poll of north carolina showed trump with a five-point lead over clinton, an advantage that sits outside that poll’s margin of error. the fox news poll also showed incumbent gop sen. richard burr with a 6 point lead over democrat deborah ross and a 3 point lead for republican gov. pat mccrory over his democratic challenger, north carolina attorney general roy cooper. but the times’ poll puts democrats ahead in both the senate and gubernatorial race. it shows ross with a 4 point lead, 46 percent to 42 percent, and cooper with a 6 point lead, 50 percent to 42 percent. the new york times poll was conducted with siena college from sept. 16-19, reaching 782 likely north carolina voters via landlines and cell phones. the poll’s margin of error was plus-or-minus 3.6 points.      poll: clinton leads trump by 2 in north carolina      
__label__0 a house panel voted thursday to hold bryan pagliano, a former technology aide to hillary clinton, in contempt of congress for refusing to testify about the private email set-up clinton used as secretary of state. the house oversight and government reform committee voted 19-15 along party lines, to send a contempt resolution to the full house. the move against pagliano took place despite repeated warnings from his attorney that the showdown was fruitless since the computer specialist would assert his fifth amendment rights in response to any questions that would be put to him. story continued below "subpoenas are not optional," panel chairman rep. jason chaffetz (r-utah) said after pagliano failed to show up at the second committee hearing he was formally called to in the past two weeks. "mr. pagliano is a crucial fact witness in this committee's investigation former secretary of state hillary clinton's of a private email server to conduct government business." democrats called the contempt citation and the demand for pagliano's public appearance a transparent political ploy aimed at embarrassing clinton as the presidential election enters its final stretch. "republicans want a photo op. they want a ready-made campaign commercial. no matter what anyone says, that is not a legitimate legislative purpose," said rep. elijah cummings of maryland, the panel's ranking democrat. an attorney for pagliano, mark macdougall, streesed that his client was ready to appear behind closed doors, but would not be part of a public spectacle. "bryan already asserted his fifth amendment right on the record before this congress. he was ready to do it again today in executive session. but the republicans voted for contempt because he wouldn’t play the role they had scripted - in the campaign ad that they wanted to tape six weeks before the election. that’s all there is to it," macdougall said in a statement. the contempt resolution requires approval by the full house. it's unclear whether a vote on the measure will be scheduled before congress takes its typical pre-election break. congress has three ways to seek enforcement of a subpoena: by filing a civil lawsuit, by asking federal prosecutors to charge someone with criminal contempt, or by having someone jailed at the capitol. it's unclear whether any of those methods will work here. a judge may not enforce the subpoena because of pagliano's fifth amendment claims, prosecutors rarely pursue such cases, and congress' own power to take witnesses into custody hasn't been used in about a century. republicans said the credibility of the congress was on the line in the dispute. some painted the confrontation in grave, nearly apocalyptic, terms. "we cannot have people come here and deny the right under the constitution for us to question them. they may not want to answer and they have that right under the constitution," rep. john mica (r-fla.) said. "if you continue that, you destroy the whole basis of our government." democrats also described the showdown as ominous, and said the panel itself might be damaged by the move. "this is a waste of time. it’s destroying this committee. it’s destroying the reputation of this committee," said del. stacey plaskett of the virgin islands. democrats repeatedly noted that last year pagliano invoked his 5th amendment rights in a closed session of the house benghazi committee. they noted his attorney offered to have pagliano appear at a closed session, but chaffetz declined. "i don’t think it should be done behind closed doors," chaffetz said. "i think it’s the way this committee should operate." however, rep. stephen lynch (d-mass.) said the law doesn't require witnesses to show up at a public hearing to assert their rights against self-incrimination. he said he wasn't too worried about the contempt resolution because he doubted any court would enforce it. "i don’t think it’s going anywhere, and i take comfort in that fact," lynch said. chaffetz insisted he has different questions for pagliano than the ones he refused to answer last year. however, pagliano's lawyer has said he will refuse to answer any questions from the oversight panel. democrats also persisted in arguments that the panel is trying to second-guess the fbi and justice department decision not to prosecute clinton or anyone else. rep. trey gowdy (r-s.c.) said that claim smacked of hypocrisy, because democrats have been at the forefront of questioning the fbi's decisions on issuing national security letters to demand information or not to prosecute bank executives over the 2008 economic collapse. "god forbid we ask the fbi anything," gowdy said sarcastically.      house panel votes to hold clinton tech aide bryan pagliano in contempt      
__label__0 it was hillary clinton's idea to appear on “between two ferns,” the irreverent web series hosted by comedian zach galifianakis, the program's executive producer told politico. the democratic presidential nominee took a page from president barack obama’s playbook with her appearance on “between two ferns” thursday. clinton’s team got the ball rolling only after the democratic presidential nominee told the senate democratic caucus how impressed she was with obama’s 2014 appearance on the show to pitch the affordable care act. “it was actually her idea, strangely enough,” comedian scott aukerman, who directs and executive produces the web series, said. “… she told her team she wanted to do it and that she really liked the one with president obama, so that kind of made the process really easy. we didn’t have to go through the hoops we sometimes have to go through in order to even get hollywood people to do it.” the interview was taped on sept. 9, the same day clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia by her doctor. it wasn’t until later that the funny or die production team found out clinton had been fighting pneumonia when she settled in for the interview. aukerman said she arrived at the end of the day, a couple of hours behind their original scheduled time, but the crew had no idea she had been feeling unwell. “we kind of went, ‘she had pneumonia?!,’” aukerman said. “we couldn’t believe it. the one clue we had was that she was drinking hot water.” the interview was taped at the new york historical society, and aukerman said it was mostly improvised. as a result of the improvisation, most of the questions galifianakis asked clinton had not been cleared with the candidate or with clinton’s team. aukerman said that it is unlikely that donald trump, the republican presidential nominee, will make a similar appearance on the show. “no, we have not invited trump to do 'between two ferns,'” aukerman said. “i don’t think he would do it … i don’t think he has thick enough skin." "i wouldn’t be surprised if his team reached out, but i’d be surprised if it ever were to happen in the same way this happened, with us being able to improvise questions," he added. if trump does do the show, don't be surprised if it is quietly released with little fanfare, just as clinton's interview was. "we hadn’t done one in a couple years so we don’t overdo them, so every time we do one, it’s a surprise," aukerman said. "we don’t put out press releases that we're about to put one out, we sneak them out in the middle of the night."      clinton camp pitched funny or die on 'between two ferns' interview      
__label__0 donald trump leads hillary clinton by 1 point among florida’s likely voters, a new suffolk university poll released thursday shows, placing the candidates in a statistical dead heat. on the sunshine state’s crowded presidential ballot, the republican nominee leads the former secretary of state by a narrow 45 percent to 44 percent margin. of the four other candidates named on the ballot, only libertarian gary johnson and green party candidate jill stein registered any support, with 3 percent and less than 1 percent, respectively. because the poll’s margin of error is plus-or-minus 4.4 percentage points, trump’s 1 point lead puts him in a statistical tie with clinton in florida. still, it is more good news for the manhattan billionaire who has also polled ahead in recent days in the key swing states of nevada, ohio and north carolina. president barack obama won those three states as well as florida in his 2008 presidential bid and lost only north carolina from that group in 2012. in the florida senate race, incumbent gop sen. marco rubio leads democratic rep. patrick murphy by 9 points, 43 percent to 34 percent. rubio, a former republican presidential candidate, had initially said he would not run for reelection to the senate if he failed to earn the nomination but wound up entering and winning florida’s gop senate primary. murphy defeated firebrand liberal rep. alan grayson in the democratic primary to earn his spot on the general election ballot. the suffolk university poll was conducted from sept. 19-21 among 500 likely florida voters. the poll’s margin of error was plus-or-minus 4.4 points.      poll: trump, clinton in virtual tie in florida      
__label__0 speaker paul ryan on thursday refused to take a position on donald trump’s controversial proposal to increase the use of stop-and-frisk tactics to reduce crime in african-american communities such as chicago. during a fox news town hall taped wednesday, the real estate tycoon said law enforcement should increase its use of stop-and-frisk to curb "black-on-black crime." story continued below “i would do stop-and-frisk,” trump told sean hannity. “we did it in new york, it worked incredibly well. and you have to be proactive.” ryan — who said earlier this week he hopes the house can pass criminal justice reform during the lame-duck session — deferred when asked about trump's statements. “i haven’t given enough thought to it,” the wisconsin republican said, later adding: “i’m not a judiciary guy so i would defer to [judiciary chairman] bob goodlatte about the constitutionality of police tactics. i can’t speak to that.” the new york city police department’s stop-and-frisk practices were ruled unconstitutional by a federal court in the summer of 2013 because they were found to be racially discriminatory. trump's pitch came on the heels of more violence in charlotte, north carolina, wednesday evening, during protests that followed the recent killings of two black men by police in tulsa, oklahoma, and charlotte. north carolina gov. pat mccrory declared a state of emergency and one civilian was reported to be on life support after being shot during a protest. on thursday, democrats slammed trump's suggestion. “donald trump is a national embarrassment and i’m looking forward to nov. 8 when this long national nightmare will end,” rep. hakeem jeffries (d-n.y.) said when asked about trump’s stop-and-frisk idea. “he constantly throws out things that have no basis in reality.” “the notion that stop and frisk had anything to do with the improving public safety numbers in new york is ludicrous and donald trump needs to check his facts," jeffries added. another new york democrat, rep. gregory meeks, said trump's rhetoric was really about mobilizing his base, not appealing to black voters. “this is supposed to be his alleged roll out to get closer and get more african american votes," meeks said. "what donald trump is really doing, and he’s done it throughout, he’s tried to present a stereotype of african americans that fits the description of some of the individuals who support him who are deplorable so that they can turn out in this vote.”      ryan defers on trump's 'stop-and-frisk' pitch      
__label__0 donald trump is planning a "national call day" to republican donors who've yet to open their wallets, hoping to close a massive fundraising gap between him and hillary clinton. trump is summoning his top fundraisers to trump tower on tuesday, the day after he squares off with hillary clinton in the first presidential debate. the fundraisers are being asked to "prepare call lists of prospective donors" and to recruit at least three people from their home states to raise funds on tuesday, according to a copy of the invitation. story continued below two people briefed on the event said it would be geared toward attracting the support of republican contributors who have yet to commit to trump financially. many of the party's top donors have expressed profound reservations over trump's candidacy and have chosen to direct their funds to down-ballot races. the push comes amid mounting concern that trump, who has lagged in the fundraising race, is being outspent and out-organized in the states that will determine the election. hillary clinton has outspent trump on the tv airwaves by a stunning 7-to-1 margin and in many battlegrounds has dozens more offices and field staffers than the republican nominee. through the end of august, clinton has outraised trump $373 million to $165 million. among those still on the sidelines are many of the gop's biggest donors. trump suffered a blow this week when las vegas casino mogul sheldon adelson revealed that he would be directing $40 million to republican groups devoted to protecting the party's congressional majorities and just $5 million toward electing the gop presidential nominee. adelson had once been seen as a potential major trump donor and seen as possibly giving as much as $100 million to boost his candidacy. tuesday's event will be hosted by vice presidential nominee mike pence and two of trump's children, eric and ivanka. it is being co-chaired by republican fundraisers anthony scaramucci, a prominent wall street investor, and roy bailey, a dallas insurance executive. bailey has long been close with former new york city mayor rudy giuliani, a prominent trump surrogate and adviser. in the invitation, the campaign says it will offer four invitations to next week's presidential debate to fundraisers who pull in at least $250,000 by friday.      trump plans post-debate fundraising blitz      
__label__0 writing as a former legislative assistant to senator robert f. kennedy and an enthusiastic supporter of hillary clinton for president, i was disappointed to see in politico the screed written by my former colleague, adam walinsky, excoriating clinton’s record on foreign policy and national security and going on to conclude that donald trump should therefore be elected president. it is one thing to disagree with secretary clinton, which walinsky does heatedly, and quite another to turn to donald trump. we should be clear that walinsky’s critique is not confined to clinton. he lays out (and massively overstates) a dark view not just of clinton but also of president obama and almost the entire democratic party. the analysis is overwrought, but even one who buys the argument defies all logic in imagining that the solution is trump. story continued below the question is not whether there is a military-industrial complex in our country. president eisenhower called us out on that and there is enough responsibility to go around among both parties for it. the 21st century version begins with the iraq war, which was originated by a republican president. i am not interested in adjudicating the issue of which party is the war party except to say that presidents obama, clinton and carter have stood for peace in important and tangible ways. the question here is whether donald trump can claim in any way that he is the candidate who stands for a foreign policy of restraint and the answer is that he cannot. walinsky finds in trump a rationality and consistency that do not exist. any reasonable observer of the presidential campaign has seen that at one moment, trump will represent himself as an isolationist who wants to end ties with nato and other allies; at another, he will lash out at any perceived insult to the u.s. or to himself, and pledges that america’s pride needs to be vindicated militarily. “america first,” trump says regularly, bringing the isolationism of charles lindbergh to mind—before excoriating president obama for not using greater force in any number of venues and then insinuating that he has a secret plan to obliterate the islamic state. to compare john f. kennedy and robert f. kennedy to donald trump is—well, i won’t finish the sentence. yes, robert kennedy turned against the vietnam war, but not because he felt that america should retreat from the world. he opposed the war because it was unjust and was based on a flawed notion of american interests. the result, as we know, was the death of vietnamese and americans and others who should not have died. jfk and rfk were internationalists. they understood that world war ii left the united states with a responsibility to play an active and constructive role in the world. they understood that america must stand together and dependably with allies who also are committed to pursue a peaceful world. they understood that the use of force was sometimes necessary and that brave men and women would be put at risk. they made those difficult, often excruciating, decisions carefully and as transparently as possible, never rashly, impulsively, or vindictively. walinsky quotes robert kennedy’s statement that if any member of the excomm other than john f. kennedy had been president during the cuban missile crisis, we would have had a nuclear war. ask yourself what a president trump might have done in that moment. “restraint” is not the word that comes to mind. this is a man who said he would order the military to kill the families of muslim terrorists and use interrogation techniques worse than waterboarding and opined that the united states should have seized iraq’s oil resources as “spoils to the victor.” yes, we have put too much power in the hands of militarists and profit seekers in both the public and private sectors. but electing donald trump is not the answer; it would only compound the problem in new and dangerous ways. the answer is an active citizenry that speaks out against the inappropriate use of force and opposes interference in conflicts that involve neither american security interests nor egregious human rights violations—a topic in which donald trump has shown an ostentatious indifference, as his fondness for vladimir putin reflects. all the evidence, provided again and again by donald trump’s own mouth, tells us not that he is a man of peace, but that he is a man of no principle—a man who will say, and possibly do, whatever happens to cross his mind at a given minute. he is like the weather in new england: if you don’t like it, wait a minute. we do not know what he believes because he does not know what he believes. we do not know what he knows because, from all we can see, he does not know much. even if walinsky’s diatribe is correct, which it most certainly is not in its breadth and depth, there is nothing in it that justifies turning to donald trump. of all occasions to break ranks with the democratic party, this is the most inappropriate. of all the ways to misappropriate the memory of john and robert kennedy, two of our greatest public servants, this is the most egregious i have ever seen. to say that i am disappointed by what walinsky has done is an understatement. america, in this election, faces an existential question—and history will judge us by our answer. walinsky has chosen the wrong side of the struggle.      robert kennedy would have hated donald trump      
__label__0 a spokesperson for the new york police department said “detectives are looking into” a report that former congressman anthony weiner traded sexually explicit messages with a girl who identified herself as a 15-year-old high school student. the exchange was first reported by the daily mail yesterday, which withheld the name of the girl because she is a minor. story continued below later thursday, cnn reported that u.s. attorney preet bharara's office has subpoenaed weiner for his cell phone and other records. weiner yesterday referred reporters to a statement he had given the daily mail, saying he regretted his online conversations but pointing to a letter the girl wrote calling the incident “a hoax.” the girl later recanted that characterization, and shared with the daily mail a series of images and messages she said she traded with weiner up until july. weiner’s 2013 mayoral campaign was rocked by revelations that he had traded sexually explicit messages with a woman after he had resigned from office in 2011. weiner's resignation was prompted by an exchange with another woman that he accidentally posted to his public twitter feed. mayor bill de blasio today said today the situation is "horrible." "i've known anthony over the years, but i know huma much better, having served side by side with her during the 2000 senate campaign," said de blasio, who managed hillary clinton's campaign for the u.s. senate that year. "i think the world of huma. i just feel horrible for her and her son that they're going through this. it's not a secret, anthony obviously has a real problem that needs treatment, and all i can say is i hope he will pursue the treatment he needs and stick with it until his issues are addressed." yesterday, governor andrew cuomo said if the report is true, it is "sick" and potentially "criminal."      new york nypd 'looking into' weiner communication with teen      
__label__0 mitch mcconnell is playing hardball — forcing democrats into a take-it-or-leave-it position on a must-pass government spending bill before funding runs dry at the end of the month. with spending negotiations still stymied at the capitol, mcconnell filed a new short-term government spending measure thursday that concedes key priorities to democrats — yet still isn’t enough to get the minority party on board. story continued below gone is the so-called icann provision, an internet-domain issue that had become a top priority for sen. ted cruz (r-texas) and other gop senators and just got the seal of endorsement from gop nominee donald trump. it also includes some funding for a sweeping opioids bill that was signed into law earlier this year, as well as a landmark chemical safety measure that became law in june. the new spending measure mcconnell filed thursday — which funds the government until dec. 9 — also includes language already worked out between democrats and republicans to deal with additional funding for the zika virus epidemic. a procedural vote on the measure is slated for tuesday afternoon, and mcconnell used a parliamentary maneuver to block amendments to the bill, ensuring that the legislation he outlined was essentially the only option. “there have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution. so that’s what i’ve just offered,” mcconnell said. “it’s the result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle.” but democrats, who have little incentive to agree quickly to a deal that lets vulnerable republicans leave washington, say they object to the legislation because while it includes flood aid for states such as louisiana, west virginia and maryland, it doesn’t include money for the long-running water crisis in flint, michigan. “to put louisiana in without flint is like waving a red flag. i don't get it," said new york sen. chuck schumer, the third-ranking senate democrat. "i haven’t counted votes but our caucus isn’t going to like having louisiana and not michigan." it also does not remove language that prohibits the securities and exchange commission from requiring companies to disclose political spending. that is current law, but democrats have tried to overturn it during the recent negotiations. democrats also floated a provision related to the export-import bank that would have restored the bank’s full financing authority, but that was not included in the spending measure mcconnell filed thursday. that ex-im provision was also important for some republicans; south carolina sen. lindsey graham said he would vote against the short-term funding bill because that language was excluded. “the president does not believe that a short-term budget measure that only exists because congress hasn’t done their job in the first place should be used to pass ideological riders into law,” white house press secretary josh earnest said thursday, while slamming republicans for their opposition to the ex-im bank. yet mcconnell's proposal is also starting to drive a rift through democrats. while some leading senate democrats stood firm in opposing the new funding measure, other democrats began to side with republicans. democratic sen. bill nelson, whose home state of florida has been the nation's epicenter of the zika crisis, said he would vote in favor of the new continuing resolution because it sets aside $1.1 billion to combat zika "with no political riders." "while i support the people of flint, my priority is the people of florida," nelson said. senate minority leader harry reid (d-nev.) signaled his displeasure with the bill shortly before mcconnell went to the floor to unveil it thursday afternoon. “we’re in no hurry to go anyplace, ok? we have all a lot of time,” reid told reporters. “i’ve talked with [house minority leader nancy pelosi], she’s not going to agree to this. the president is not going to agree to this. it’s really unfair to the american people.” during her weekly news conference earlier thursday, pelosi said the legislation, “in my view, is not even worthy of a counter. it falls very short.” maryland sen. barbara mikulski, the top democratic appropriator, charged mcconnell with filing a “republican-only bill" and said democrats would not support the legislation, although details of the measure were still emerging and some senators had yet to review it. house speaker paul ryan, for his part, is trying to project an air of calm, telling reporters that lawmakers in his chamber want "low drama" in order to solve the government funding impasse. but cruz is pressuring house lawmakers to fight on behalf of the internet domain provision that he championed. "i am grateful for my senate colleagues' vigorous support during this debate," cruz said in a statement. "i encourage my colleagues in the house to continue to stand united to ensure that the government funding bill prevents the obama administration from permanently undermining free speech on the internet." heather caygle, louis nelson, burgess everett and ashley gold contributed to this report.      mcconnell plays hardball in spending fight      
__label__0 pittsburgh — attempting to strike a unifying, presidential tone while commenting thursday about urban unrest in charlotte, donald trump veered temporarily off-script and attributed the violence — without offering any evidence — to drugs. "if you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television," he said. story continued below following a night of wall-to-wall cable coverage of the violent protests in response to another police shooting of an african-american man, the republican presidential nominee aimed to square his law-and-order philosophy with his eleventh-hour outreach efforts to the country's african-american communities. trump, who trails hillary clinton by approximately 80 percent points among african-american voters, explained that his promise to restore order to cities plagued by racial tensions is an effort to protect disproportionately affected minority communities. "there is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a trump administration," he said at the beginning of remarks to the shale insight convention. "our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disrupter, but to make life more comfortable for the african-american parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and to get their children a great education. we have to cherish and protect those people." trump's stated concern is of a piece with his recent visits to african-american churches in detroit and flint and his stumping in ohio wednesday with boxing promoter don king, who vouched for the candidate's character. but his ad-libbed comment blaming drugs for these violent uprisings seemed to validate stereotypes about black communities — seemingly supporting the criticism that trump's larger outreach effort to african-american voters is really an attempt to convince moderate republican women that he isn't a racist. as he often does, trump praised police officers for risking their lives but acknowledged, as he did on wednesday, that their judgment in pressure situations is not infallible. "police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed," trump said. "but our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude. they are the line separating civilization from total chaos."      trump blames 'drugs' for charlotte unrest      
__label__0 kathy miller, the chair of trump's campaign in mahoning county, ohio, resigned thursday, according to a statement from the trump ohio campaign. the resignation comes after miller made racially charged remarks to the guardian. on thursday morning, miller said that there was "no racism" before obama. she made the inflammatory comments to the guardian's anywhere but washington series, when she said, "if you’re black and you haven’t been successful in the last 50 years, it’s your own fault. you’ve had every opportunity, it was given to you." story continued below she further charged, “you’ve had the same schools everybody else went to. you had benefits to go to college that white kids didn’t have. you had all the advantages and didn’t take advantage of it. it’s not our fault, certainly.” the ohio campaign statement read, "our county chairs are volunteers who signed up to help organize grassroots outreach like door-knocking and phone calls, they are not spokespeople for the campaign. i have accepted kathy miller's resignation as the mahoning county chair in light of these inappropriate comments." miller also referred to the black lives matter movement as "a stupid waste of time" and suggested lower voter turnout among blacks has to do with "the way they were raised." the ohio campaign statement included what it said was a statement from miller apologizing for her comments, saying they were inappropriate and that she is not a campaign spokesperson, and was not speaking on its behalf. tracy winbush will replace miller as mahoning county campaign chair, according to the statement. she will also be the elector for the electoral college.      trump campaign chair in ohio county resigns after making racially charged comments

__label__0 attorney general loretta lynch publicly questioned the wisdom of broad-based stop-and-frisk policies as a crime-fighting tool thursday, in the wake of comments from donald trump urging use of the technique to cut down on gun violence. asked about her views on the practice, lynch said she would not be drawn into debate about comments made by political candidates, but she clearly disagreed with the gop presidential nominee by insisting that the use of the tactic had been counterproductive in new york city. "in new york … that practice was implemented in a way that was not helpful to community trust and to, frankly, public safety and enhancing the relationship between law enforcement and community members," lynch said in response to question from politico at a press conference about a crackdown on mail-fraud schemes. "the issue with stop-and-frisk in the new york area was the widespread indiscriminate use of that practice, particularly when it was not generating success from a law enforcement perspective, in either leads or tips or firearms, and the resulting lack of trust that it generated," the attorney general said. in an interview wednesday, trump called for broader use of stop-and-frisk and specifically praised its success in combating crime in new york. "i see what's going on here, i see what's going on in chicago," trump said in cleveland during a taping of fox news' "hannity " "i think stop-and-frisk, in new york city, it was so incredible the way it worked. and, we had a very good mayor. but new york city was incredible the way that worked. so, i think that would be one step you could do." use of the proactive technique, promoted by former new york mayor michael bloomberg, has long angered many civil rights activists. in 2013, a judge in new york ruled that it had been carried out in an unconstitutional, racially discriminatory manner. an appeals court halted that ruling, but while the appeal was pending, the city — under new mayor bill de blasio —wound up settling the case. in comments thursday, trump revised his earlier remarks, insisting he was only advocating the practice in murder-plagued chicago. “i was really referring to chicago with stop-and-frisk,” he told “fox and friends” during a phone interview thursday morning. “they asked me about chicago and i was talking about stop-and-frisk for chicago.” chicago has seen a spike in murders and shootings, with over 500 killings in 2016 and three months still to go in the year. "i think chicago needs stop-and-frisk,” trump said. “now, people can criticize me for that or people can say whatever they want, but they asked me about chicago, and i think stop-and-frisk, with good, strong, you know, good, strong law and order. but you have to do something. it can’t continue the way it’s going.” lynch, who spent two stints as chief federal prosecutor in brooklyn before being nominated as attorney general, said she wasn't opposed to stop-and-frisk techniques under certain circumstances. "as with every police procedure we want to empower law enforcement to be responsive to community needs. we want to empower them to protect the community. we want to give them the training they need in order to do it in a way that is constitutional, safe and effective and promotes trust," lynch said.

__label__0 the anti-donald trump movement is on its death bed, the republican presidential nominee boasted on wednesday. “you’ll hear about these never trumpers, who are dying. right now they’re on respirators, ok,” trump said in response to a question about whether he will stand firm on his commitment to naming “true constitutionalists” to the supreme court. story continued below trump cited an “amazing” wall street journal report “about all of the support that we’re getting.” the real estate mogul appears to be referring to a story published online late monday in which the journal reported that billionaires sheldon adelson and joe ricketts plan to pump millions of dollars into trump and a pro-trump super pac. “from lots of rich people even,” trump said of the fresh support he’s getting. “they’re coming in. these were never trump, never trump, never trump and now they’re — believe me, they see lower taxes, they see cutting the regulations, they see job creation, which is so important, and it’s really been amazing.” “and one of the things that they see and that you people see,” he told the group of pastors inside a cleveland church, “is that — and so important — the judges. so i picked 11 judges. very, very much into the world of the constitution because we have people that, in some cases, not — i think in all cases — will have absolutely no — the constitution will have no bearing on their decisions, ok, if somebody else gets it. and we picked 11 and we’re adding nine more. we’re gonna have a total of 20 people and i will pick from that group of 20 people. these are 20 outstanding people.”      trump says never trumpers ‘are dying, on respirators’      
__label__0 cleveland — donald trump campaigned wednesday morning in a church in a historically african-american community and sold himself as the candidate who could fix the problems of urban america. within hours, trump was proposing a vast expansion of “stop-and-frisk” policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profiling. it was just another day in trump’s up-and-down black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by hillary clinton and the democrats. story continued below the effort has taken trump from a black church in inner-city detroit earlier this month to addressing largely white audiences in rural north carolina where, on tuesday evening, he proclaimed in a small town named after a slaveholder that black communities "are absolutely in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever." on wednesday, trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter don king — who dropped the n-word before a group of pastors at a cleveland church while extolling trump as a “gladiator.” king hailed trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have suffered. “the system is the problem, and he’s the only gladiator that will take on the system,” king said. after the church event, trump sat for a “town hall” with fox news host and unabashed supporter sean hannity. asked by an audience member what he would do to address “violence in the black community,” trump embraced stop-and-frisk. “we did it in new york, it worked incredibly well,” trump said. fierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that bill de blasio rode to prominence and, ultimately, the mayor’s office. but even before trump’s stop-and-frisk comments, he was taking heat for his “ever, ever, ever” remark tuesday night. “i don't know what mr. trump is talking about to say that the situation for african-americans is worse than it's ever been,” rep. john lewis, the democratic civil rights icon, said wednesday on msnbc. “is he talking about worse than slavery? worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination — when we couldn't take a seat at the lunch counter and be served? worse than being denied the right to register to vote, to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities?” trump’s polling numbers among african-american voters have been dismal — in the low single digits — and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters, particularly women and those in the suburbs, that he is not racist. trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks — “what do you have to lose?” he says — to largely white audiences. at the new spirit revival center in cleveland, trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowd. seated to trump’s right was mike pence, his soft-spoken running mate. to his left, outspoken longtime attorney michael cohen. behind him: king (“there’s only one,” trump said), former presidential rival ben carson (“tough”), retired lt. gen. michael flynn (“a tough general”) and former "apprentice" star omarosa manigault (“a wonderful woman”), who has helped with trump’s black outreach. “i’m different from a lot of republicans, frankly,” trump said from the pulpit. trump, who has called himself the “law and order” candidate, criticized the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in oklahoma last week. trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been “choking” in the fatal shooting. trump has mostly defended the police in such incidents. "now, did she get scared? was she choking? what happened? but maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, ok?” king, whom top gop officials had pushed not to speak at the republican national convention due to a past manslaughter conviction, was given the prime slot of introducing trump at a forum billed as a pastors leadership conference. king, clothed in a sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of israel and the united states, argued repeatedly that “the system” had oppressed minorities and women and only trump can upend it entirely. “every white woman should cast a vote for donald trump,” said king, who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of african-americans. “i told michael jackson, i said if you're poor, you're a poor negro — i would use the n-word — but if you rich, you are a rich negro; if you are intelligent, intellectual, you're an intellectual negro; if you're a dancing and sliding and gliding n-----, i mean, negro,” king said. when trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later, he grinned, “ah, there’s only one don king.” before king, cohen, trump’s attorney, used his time at the church to slash at the “disgusting, liberal, mainstream media” and its casting of trump as a “racist.” “the word of the 2016 election has somehow become ‘racist,’” cohen complained. “i’ve lost count as to how many times the disgusting, liberal, mainstream media have attempted to label mr. donald trump as racist, a xenophobe and a bigot. and let’s not forget, sexist, misogynist, narcissist, islamophobe, anti-hispanic, anti-semite demagogue. and countless others. it’s disgraceful.” cohen said, “not only is donald trump not a racist, he believes that all people are part of one race: the human race.” trump insisted that democrats had abandoned black voters, and that he wouldn’t. “they come and they take your vote,” trump said, “and they say they’ll see you in four years.”      trump’s puzzling pitch to black voters      
__label__0 rep. john lewis, a civil rights icon, on wednesday blasted donald trump’s statements about the state of the black community and america’s inner cities. “i don’t know what mr. trump is talking about to say that the situation for african-americans is worse than it’s ever been,” the georgia democrat said when asked by msnbc’s andrea mitchell about trump’s comments. “is he talking about worse than slavery? worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination — when we couldn’t take a seat at the lunch counter and be served? worse than being denied the right to register to vote, to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities?” story continued below lewis was responding to comments trump made during a campaign event tuesday in north carolina. “we’re going to rebuild our inner cities because our african-american communities are absolutely in the worst shape they’ve ever been in before. ever, ever, ever,” trump said. it’s part of a broader case trump has been making to black voters, arguing that their situation is dire due to democratic policies and that they should vote for republicans because their circumstances could not be worse. a surrogate for the new york businessman's campaign said trump was not suggesting that african-americans are worse off now than under jim crow segregation. "i don't think he's talking about the days of jim crow, even the days of the civil rights movement of the '60s and obviously not slavery. but he's saying the african-american community is at times being outpaced by other communities," joseph borelli, a new york city council member, told cnn on wednesday. lewis wasn't the only prominent member of the african-american community to harshly criticize trump's comments wednesday. cornell william brooks, president of the national association for the advancement of colored people, ripped trump on cnn's "the situation room" for ignoring in his comments racial injustices from the slavery and jim crow eras. “for anyone to assert that the african-american community is in the worst shape ever, ever, ever … is to demonstrate an insulting degree of ignorance and insensitivity,” he said. “we expect more from our presidential candidates.” cristiano lima contributed to this report.      john lewis blasts trump's 'worst shape ever' comments
