__label__0 hillary clinton never misses a chance to score political points or votes, as far as donald trump's campaign manager kellyanne conway is concerned. conway laced into clinton on wednesday, a day after the democratic nominee remarked upon "implicit bias" in policing while commenting on the police-involved shooting of an african-american man in oklahoma to steve harvey's radio show. story continued below “it’s just unbelievable that she would do that before we even know the facts, the details. i think that’s an overpoliticization of a situation where we don’t know the facts," conway told fox news host brian kilmeade on his "kilmeade & friends" radio program. “the loss of life is tragic and i feel like we all should be looking at it non-partisanly, not even bipartisanly, if you will. i'm using a new adverb here, brian. but this is what she does. it’s like, she doesn’t pass up a moment to weigh in and try to score points or score votes.” she later added, "the best answer, sometimes, is no answer," remarking upon the nature of breaking news and evolving details of recent incidents like the ones in tulsa, oklahoma, and in charlotte, north carolina, where another man was shot and killed tuesday. "but i’m going to see how many in the mainstream media actually play that clip today and harangue hillary clinton for that, brian," conway said. trump referred to the tulsa and charlotte shootings on wednesday, both on his twitter account and in remarks before pastors in ohio, while clinton tweeted the names of the victims. "keith lamont scott. terence crutcher. too many others. this has got to end. -h," the democratic nominee wrote. bringing up the point that trump was "completely harangued" by the media after pronouncing the explosion saturday night in new york a "bomb" before it was confirmed as such, conway noted that the alleged perpetrator ended "being a radical islamic terrorist whose wife says, ex-wife says hates america and hates gays and his father said his son was a terrorist." clinton used the term "bombings" to reporters on her plane, conway recalled, adding, "so let’s just see the double standard at play here." "she just jumps on this not knowing any of the facts, and so i think that’s where politicians, and she is quite a typical one, get themselves in trouble, where everything is seen through a political lens," conway said.      trump campaign manager accuses clinton of politicizing police killings      
__label__0 rudy giuliani on wednesday ripped into president barack obama and hillary clinton for a "dereliction of duty" in their efforts to combat terrorism, while calling the bush administration's failure to come to grips with the threat before the sept. 11 attacks "excusable." writing in usa today, the former new york city mayor and current donald trump surrogate accused obama and clinton of investing “too much time and energy into the narrative that there is no ongoing war on terror.” story continued below he argued that obama and his former secretary of state had responded inadequately to the recent violence — including the planted bombs in new york and new jersey — and underestimated the threat of terrorism to the country generally. “obama and clinton continue to ignore the reality that a worldwide terror campaign is being deliberately executed by the very people they refuse to define: radical islamic terrorists,” giuliani wrote. “obama and clinton's gut reaction is to tell the american people that we’re defeating the islamic state terrorist group abroad while systematically downplaying connections between radical islam and attackers in the united states and europe.” while clinton first urged officials to “let this investigation unfold” after hearing reports of an explosion in the chelsea neighborhood of new york on saturday, trump emphatically declared it a bomb and then boasted when authorities later confirmed the planted explosive devices. (clinton, however, also made reference to "bombings" in her initial statements.) republicans have also repeatedly criticized obama for arguing against using the term "radical islamic terrorism" for the islamic state and its sympathizers. clinton previously refrained from repeating the term, but has since used the words "radical islamism" to describe the threat in the wake of the mass shooting in a gay nightclub in orlando, fla., in june. also faulting its withdrawal of troops from iraq and blaming the move for the rise of the islamic state, giuliani argued that the obama administration fails to “comprehend the threats before us today,” which he charged is a “clear dereliction of duty.” giuliani had warmer words for obama’s predecessor, however, suggesting that the bush administration’s "failure to fully comprehend the threat before sept. 11 is excusable."      giuliani accuses obama and clinton of 'dereliction of duty' in terror threat      
__label__0 hillary clinton leads donald trump in the nation’s smallest battleground state, according to a new monmouth university poll of likely voters in new hampshire released on wednesday. the poll, which was conducted last saturday through tuesday, shows clinton with a 9-point advantage over trump, 47 percent to 38 percent. libertarian gary johnson is at 10 percent, green party nominee jill stein garners 1 percent, and another 3 percent of likely voters are undecided. new hampshire will only award 4 electoral votes this fall. but the state has outsized importance in the battle for the senate, and the monmouth poll shows incumbent gop sen. kelly ayotte with a slim, 2-point lead over her democratic challenger, popular gov. maggie hassan, 47 percent to 45 percent. that is well within the poll’s margin of error: plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. and republicans also have an early lead in the governor’s race, after both parties selected their nominees in last week’s primaries. republican chris sununu leads his relatively unknown democratic opponent, colin van ostern, 49 percent to 43 percent. in the presidential race, clinton leads trump because more democrats (94 percent) have lined up behind the former secretary of state than republicans (85 percent) who are supporting trump. clinton also leads among independents, 42 percent to 35 percent. neither clinton nor trump is popular, but trump’s negatives outweigh clinton’s. thirty-six percent of likely voters have a favorable opinion of clinton, while 56 percent view her unfavorably. trump’s favorable rating is lower: 30 percent favorable, compared to 63 percent unfavorable. it's another in a series of polls this week that show clinton regaining some momentum after losing ground last week amid the fallout of her "basket of deplorables" comment and pneumonia diagnosis. monmouth has also showed clinton leading trump by 5 points in vote-rich florida, and within striking distance in georgia, which has been reliably republican in recent elections. both candidates in the senate race are well liked: half of likely voters approve of how ayotte is handling her job as senator, and 38 percent disapprove. hassan’s approval rating is even higher: sixty percent approve of the second-term governor’s job performance, and only 31 percent disapprove. neither candidate in the gubernatorial race is well known, but sununu — whose father, john, served three terms as governor in the 1980s, and brother, also named john, served a term in the senate last decade — has higher name id. thirty-six percent of likely voters have a favorable opinion of sununu, 22 percent view him unfavorably, and 41 percent have no opinion of the republican. but van ostern is little known: twenty-eight percent view him favorably, and only 6 percent have an unfavorable opinion. but roughly 2-in-3 voters, 66 percent, have no opinion of the democratic nominee. the poll surveyed 400 likely voters.      poll: clinton leads trump in new hampshire      
__label__0 washington post reporter david fahrenthold has been doggedly reporting on donald trump's charitable record, tracking down everything from $10,000 paintings of trump paid for by his non-profit foundation to his promised donations to veterans. and in the wake of statements from the trump campaign personally attacking fahrenthold, the post is pushing back. "the trump campaign's response to our reporting has been full of personal insults and devoid of any discussion of the facts," senior politics editor steven ginsberg said in a statement. "we have reached out to the campaign repeatedly, by phone, email and on social media, and they have yet to answer our questions. we welcome a response that addresses the legitimate questions raised about the trump foundation." the trump campaign has not responded to fahrenthold's detailed questions about trump's donations, but issued a comment late tuesday after an explosive new report by fahrenthold showed that trump used $258,000 from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire’s for-profit businesses. in a statement on tuesday evening, spokesman jason miller said the post, a news organizations trump had previously blacklisted, has "gotten their facts wrong." "it is the clinton foundation that is set up to make sure the clinton's personally enrich themselves by selling access and trading political favors," miller said. "the trump foundation has no paid board, no management fees, no rent or overhead, and no family members on its payroll. there was not, and could not be, any intent or motive for the trump foundation to make improper payments. all contributions are reported to the irs, and all foundation donations are publicly disclosed. mr. trump is generous both with his money and with his time. he has provided millions of dollars to fund his foundation and a multitude of other charitable causes." the statement then went on to personally attack fahrenthold, a theme echoed by campaign manager kellyanne conway who in an interview on cnn said fahrenthold has an "obsession". "the post’s reporting is peppered with inaccuracies and omissions from a biased reporter who is clearly intent on distracting attention away from the corrupt clinton foundation, a vehicle for the clinton's to peddle influence at the expense of the american people. mr. trump personally and the trump foundation, however, are staying focused on their charitable giving to veterans, the police, children and other deserving recipients," miller said. fahrenthold, for his part, is still on the trail.      washington post: trump campaign response to fahrenthold 'devoid of any discussion of the facts'      
__label__0 in preparing for donald trump's rumble with hillary clinton on monday night, campaign manager kellyanne conway said wednesday that her team is "well acquainted" with footage of its adversary's past bouts on the debate stage, assessing the former secretary of state's approach as "so lengthy" and "so lawyerly." clinton "got tripped up quite a bit" in the primary debates against bernie sanders, conway remarked on fox news radio's "kilmeade & friends," suggesting that the former secretary of state was " trying to be a little bit more of a centrist, a little bit more of a moderate like her husband was, his winning formula in 1992, not realizing that the modern democratic party … would never welcome bill clinton 1992 now." story continued below "it’s considerably to the left, so she was easily tripped up by bernie sanders on foreign policy, on her record of failures. we’re very aware of that," conway said. "and of course, we’re very aware of mr. trump’s both style and his substance in these debates against these other republicans. he started out at the fox news debate on aug. 6, 2015, dead center in the middle because he was leading in the polls, brian, and he never left that place." addressing people who "are questioning" trump's preparation, conway remarked that the candidates set to appear on stage at hofstra university are "two very different people," pointing to the commander in chief forum earlier this month as an example. after that event, conway said, "all of the polls" said trump beat clinton. "why? well, her answers are so lengthy, they’re so lawyerly," conway continued, noting that clinton only received "six or seven questions ... that night because she just takes forever. she’s apologizing, she’s dissembling, she’s deflecting. donald trump’s answers are concise and they’re confident, and they’re pointed the way a leader, the way a leader answers questions, frankly." asked whether upon reviewing the tapes she could ascertain a difference between clinton's debate performances in the 2008 cycle and those eight years later, conway said, "clearly." "the 2008 hillary clinton had the confidence of a frontrunner. this was her race to lose. she was talking more about, remember, she was against same-sex marriage, she had been for closed borders in her career," she continued. "she was, i think at the time even for safe, legal and rare abortions the way her husband tried to pretend he was in the early ‘90s. in 2016, she tried to out-sanders sanders, and part of it is because again, how leftward her party has gone, away from the mainstream." where clinton had confidence against barack obama and other democrats on stage in the 2008 cycle, the clinton of 2016 was "easily flummoxed by bernie sanders," conway said. the clinton campaign, meanwhile, is concerned that moderators might hold the candidates to different standards of scrutiny. "i think that, my biggest concern is not a view of any moderator but just that people accommodate their questions and lower the bar of their questions to suit the candidate in front of them," communications director jennifer palmieri told reporters, going on to say that trump has been asked easier questions "because he has not put forward detailed material, which you can … question him on." thus, palmieri continued, trump "ends up getting much more one-dimensional, simple questions, and that is not what should be expected of somebody" participating in a debate for president of the united states. "and i think the moderators need to ask substantive questions, factual questions, and to keep them on even playing field even though he has failed to put forward the kinds of detailed or multi-tiered policy positions as she has," palmieri added.      trump campaign manager knocks clinton as too 'lawyerly' for debates      
__label__0 over the course of his 75 years on and off the basketball court, bobby knight said wednesday that he has never met anyone who can fix mistakes quite like donald trump. "there’s nobody that i’ve met in my lifetime that has a better grasp of how to correct mistakes and how to look at what’s wrong and how to correct what’s wrong and how to get it going right," knight told an audience in toledo, ohio, his home state. "and i think that is the most important thing that can be brought to the next president of the united states. and there’s nobody who has a better background in correcting things that are going wrong and getting things going in the right direction and developing those things — the best person ever has been donald trump." story continued below back on the campaign trail with trump after several months, knight extolled the republican nominee as "not just an american; he’s a world figure." "he’s known all over the world. donald trump put a lot of businesses together," the coach continued. "united states around the world. a lot of businesses. created a lot of jobs, thousands of jobs for people around the world." and trump, knight later indicated, is the person for the white house. "believe me when i tell you, i think you’re all gonna agree on this: our next president is gonna inherit a hell of a lot of problems, and it’s gonna take a problem solver to get us back where we want to be and where we should be, and there is no one that even comes close to being smart, tough and dedicated completely to the united states of america," knight said. he noted that the next president would have to deal with the national debt, "immigration problems and on and on." remarking on his study of history, knight said that he had come to the conclusion that "when i need somebody on my side to help us with problems, he's the first man i want to choose and the first man i want to see." knight, clad in a red, white and blue gingham shirt, acknowledged to the crowd that he doesn't "dress as well as politicians dress, but i want you to know, and it’s for all of you folks, i wore my red, white and blue shirt today." "and i think that when you leave, i hope you all go out and buy a red, white and blue shirt, because it’s indicative of your love for the greatest country in the world, the united states," knight said.      bobby knight: nobody can 'correct mistakes' like trump      
__label__0 the latest shootings by police of black men show that little has been done to reduce the violence at the hands of law enforcement, black lives matter activist deray mckesson said on wednesday, as he expressed frustration over the frequency of such incidents. "police kill almost three people everyday," mckesson told politico, as unrest simmers over the two deaths of black men by police over the past week. "we have to hold the police accountable for their actions." story continued below protests shook the city of charlotte, north carolina, overnight and into the early morning after a black man was shot dead by police tuesday night. the demonstrations, which at times turned violent, spilled over into the apartment complex where keith lamont scott was killed. charlotte police maintain that scott stepped out of his vehicle with a gun when officers arrived at the scene, but his family disputes this claim, saying he was sitting in his car reading a book. the charlotte police department could not be immediately reached for comment. the shooting comes as racial tensions were already high across the country after police shot dead an unarmed black man in tulsa, oklahoma last week. terence crutcher's family says officer betty shelby inappropriately fired on him after their suv broke down, while her lawyer contends that crutcher was acting suspiciously and appeared to be reaching inside the vehicle for a gun. while the shootings have again grabbed national headlines – and attention from the two presidential candidates – mckesson said police need to start being held accountable for the violence, and that he hopes there are consequences for the officers in the most recent fatal shootings. "[i'm] looking forward to how this plays out in terms of criminal charges,” said mckesson, who was an early leader of the black lives matter movement and co-founded campaign zero, the first effort to organize activists around a set of policies to stop police violence. mckesson said while the federal government has a role to play in reforming police behavior, the onus is really on local departments to change their ways. "what's he to say?" he said when asked if president barack obama is doing enough to combat police violence, adding "the department of justice could reduce funding to local police departments, and they haven't really done that aggressively.” in the meantime, mckesson said he would continue trying to draw attention to the issue. campaign zero on wednesday launched a new project at useofforceproject.org, which takes a look at 91 of 100 police departments in the biggest cities in the united states. the report examines the use of force policies of the departments and concludes whether there are basic protections against police violence in the policies. "many police departments fail to establish common sense restrictions on police use of force — including deadly force — that would actually benefit the communities they are supposed to protect and serve," the report states. "according to our findings, fundamentally changing use of force policies can dramatically reduce the number of people killed by police in america." "the police has a shadow system that almost guarantees they won't be held accountable," mckesson said, adding that these policies, and the lack of provisions to safeguard against police violence make it extremely difficult to reduce these incidents from recurring.      black lives matter's mckesson says police must be held accountable in latest shootings      
__label__0 israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu poked fun at president barack obama’s golf obsession wednesday as he extended an invitation to the president to visit him in israel. “as you conclude your presidency, i know you’re gonna be busy with many, many things — much more than improving what i hear is a terrific golf game,” netanyahu said to obama, as the two appeared before the media, with a backdrop of american and israeli flags, after meeting on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly in new york. “your voice, your influential voice, will be heard for many decades, and i know you’ll continue to support israel's right to defend itself and its right to thrive as a jewish state.” story continued below “so i want you to know, barack, that you’ll always be a welcome guest in israel,” the prime minister continued. “and, by the way, i don’t play golf, but right next to my home in caesarea in israel is a terrific golf course.” obama responded in jest, remarking as they shook hands that the pair will “set up a tee time.” “i guarantee you i will visit israel often because it is a beautiful country with beautiful people, and michelle and the girls, i think, resent the fact that i have not taken them on most of these trips,” obama added. “so they’re insistent that i do take them, of course. they will appreciate the fact that the next time i visit israel i won’t have to sit in bilats but instead can enjoy the sights and sounds of a remarkable country.” while the two heads of state have a strained relationship, both were all smiles wednesday as they touted the “unbreakable” bond the u.s. shares with israel. “as prime minister netanyahu mentioned, the bond between the united states and israel is unbreakable,” obama said. “it is based on common values, family ties, a recognition that a jewish state of israel is one of our most important allies and a guiding principle throughout my presidency. one that i’ve expressed often to the prime minister is that it is important for america’s national security to ensure that we have a safe and secure israel, one that can defend itself.”      netanyahu pokes at obama's 'terrific golf game'

__label__0 the senate on wednesday backed a $1.15 billion arms sale to saudi arabia, even as congress is preparing to override an expected presidential veto of a different bill allowing 9/11 victims’ families to sue the saudi government. the senate voted 71-27 to table, or kill, the resolution from sens. rand paul (r-ky.) and chris murphy (d-conn.) that would have blocked the $1.15 billion sale of abrams tanks to saudi arabia, which the state department approved last month. story continued below while the vote was unsuccessful, murphy said his goal wasn’t necessarily to pass the resolution, but rather to press saudi arabia on its role in the civil war in yemen. riyadh has been accused of killing civilians with airstrikes in yemen and other human rights violations. “i don’t think the saudis are interested in continually having a debate about the future of u.s.-saudi relationship on the floor of the senate or the house,” murphy told politico ahead of the vote. “i knew from the beginning that this was not becoming law. my point here is to raise a discussion about the war in yemen and saudi behavior in the region that isn’t happening.” opponents of the resolution — including republican senate foreign policy stalwarts like armed services chairman john mccain (r-ariz.) and foreign relations chairman bob corker (r-tenn.) — argued that the saudis were important allies in the middle east, despite their abuses in the war in yemen. “were this resolution disapproval ever to be adopted, it would further convince the world that the united states is retreating not only from its commitments, but also as the guarantor of the international order,” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on the floor wednesday. the arms sale vote comes at a tense time in u.s.-saudi relations, as congress is preparing to override a presumed veto on legislation that also targets saudi arabia. the white house plans to issue a formal veto of the justice against sponsors of terrorism act, which would allow families of the victims of the sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks to sue foreign governments found responsible for them. the legislation, which breezed unanimously through both chambers of the capitol earlier this year, has long been viewed as focusing on saudi arabia’s alleged role in the terrorist attacks. the so-called “28 pages,” part of a 2002 probe that was declassified in july, included some indications that appear to suggest links between a handful of saudis in the united states and two of the 9/11 hijackers. some influential lawmakers have shown hesitation about the 9/11 bill and its implications as an override vote became imminent. president barack obama has not vetoed the legislation yet; he has until friday to do so, and mcconnell said the vote will be held before senators leave washington until the november elections. murphy said it was “unfortunate” the timing of the two bills intersected, arguing they were two separate issues that both happened to deal with saudi arabia. “i think there are a lot of people who want to vote — who will vote to override the jasta veto and then vote against our resolution as a means of balancing their votes out,” he said. “had our resolution happened at a different time, the vote might be different.” opponents of the disapproval resolution also made a distinction between supporting the 9/11 bill and supporting the arms sale to the saudis. republicans who came to the floor to back the sale tied it to iran, charging that iran was on the other side of the civil war in yemen and that saudi arabia was essential as a counterbalance in the region. “you're talking about a body and an idea that is ass-backwards, this is one for the ages,” said sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.). “to those who want to vote today to suspend this aid to saudi arabia, people in iran will cheer you on.” the u.s. has played a support role for saudi arabia in the yemen civil war, providing aerial refueling and intelligence sharing. the proposed arms sale to the saudis includes 153 abrams tanks, and 20 “battle damage replacements,” likely from their use in the yemen war. wednesday vote wasn’t the first time that paul and murphy have teamed up to force a vote on a sale to a middle eastern ally with a checkered history. in march, the pair forced a vote on the sale of f-16 fighter jets to pakistan, which was also blocked by the senate, 71 to 24. paul’s senate campaign sent out a note to his supporters ahead of the vote wednesday, urging them to “#standwithrand” and to sign a petition backing his resolution.      senate backs tank sales to saudi arabia      
__label__0 federal prosecutors are pushing back against a demand by defense lawyers that new york and new jersey bombing suspect ahmad rahami be arraigned immediately on federal charges he is facing. late tuesday, defense attorneys wrote to federal magistrate judge gabriel gorenstein asking that rahami be promptly informed of the charges against him at a court proceeding that would also formally advise him of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent. however, prosecutors from the office of u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york preet bharara said in a letter to the magistrate wednesday that rahami isn't in federal custody so there is no legal obligation for the federal courts to get involved. "the defendant in this case, ahmad khan rahami, a/k/a 'ahmad rahimi,' has not been arrested on any federal charge. he is not in federal custody. he is in the custody of the state of new jersey, on state charges, and is subject to a bail package issued by the new jersey state court," federal prosecutors wrote. "while a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum has been lodged with the united states marshals service, it has not been executed, and there has been no such federal arrest." the writ referred to in the federal prosecutors' letter would require state or local officials to hand over rahami to federal authorities for prosecution. rahami is facing five attempted murder charges in a new jersey court in connection with a shootout monday morning in which the suspect and two police officers were wounded. rahami is currently in a newark hospital. a judge has set $5.2 million bail and an initial county court appearance for sept. 28. defense lawyers contend that rahami has been "without the benefit of counsel" since his arrest, but it's unclear whether he's been advised of his miranda rights or whether he's made some decision not to meet with an attorney. lawmakers briefed on the investigation say he has not been cooperating. while attorney general loretta lynch said wednesday that rahami would be taken to manhattan in the "near future," the letter from prosecutors evinces no urgency to such a move. prosecutors say rahami has no rights in the federal system at the moment, including a right to counsel. the letter indicates that lawyers from the federal defenders office in new york have sought appointment in rahami's case, but prosecutors say that's "plainly premature" until he is brought to court. prosecutors cited a series of terrorism cases where judges ruled defendants were not entitled to court-appointed counsel until they appear in court. court records show no immediate action from gorenstein on the request for rahami's arraignment or the defense lawyers' request to be appointed as his counsel in the case.      u.s. attorney sees no rush to arraign rahami in federal court      
__label__0 hillary clinton on wednesday lamented the deaths of two african-american men this week by police officers, calling such killings “unbearable” and adding that they need “to become intolerable.” clinton’s remarks on the shootings, one in tulsa, oklahoma, and the other in charlotte, north carolina, came at the top of a speech that was billed as focusing on economic issues. but the former secretary of state told the orlando, florida, crowd that she felt compelled to address the news of the day. story continued below “there is still a lot we don’t know yet about what happened in both incidents. but we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of african-americans killed by police officers in these encounters,” she said. “look, i know i don’t have all the answers. i don’t know anyone who does. but this is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn’t have.“ clinton bemoaned not just the two police-involved deaths from this week, but also violence against police that occurred last week in philadelphia and tuesday night in charlotte. she balanced calls for an end to the killings of black men at the hands of law enforcement with praise for the police departments that handled a mass-stabbing attack in minnesota and explosions in new york and new jersey over the weekend. “i’ve spoken to many police chiefs and other law enforcement leaders who are as deeply concerned as i am and as deeply committed as i am to reform. why? because they know it is essential for the safety of our communities and our officers,” she said. “i’ve also been privileged to spend a lot of time with mothers who have lost children, and young people who feel that, as far as their country’s concerned, their lives seem disposable. we’ve got to do better. and i know we can. and if i’m elected president, we will.” from there, clinton returned to her speech’s stated topic: “building an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.” she called for the inclusion of more women in the labor force, improved access to affordable education, and immigration reform, which clinton said would help families and be a boon for the u.s. economy. but the former secretary of state spent the bulk of her speech calling for improved economic opportunities for americans with disabilities, a group she said is “too often invisible — overlooked and undervalued.” as president, clinton said she would seek to advance employment opportunities for those with disabilities and make higher education more accessible to them as well. she also called for the ratification of the united nations convention on the rights of persons with disabilities. “men and women, boys and girls who have talents, skills, ideas and dreams for themselves and their families, just like anybody else. whether they can participate in our economy and lead rich, full lives that are as healthy and productive as possible is a reflection on us as a country,” she said. “and right now, in too many ways, we are falling short. we’ve got to face that, and do better, for everyone’s sake. because this really does go to the heart of who we are as americans.”      clinton: too many people have lost their lives in police encounters      
__label__0 donald trump on wednesday called for the controversial “stop-and-frisk” policing practice to be instituted nationwide as a means of combating violent crime in america’s inner cities. in a pre-taped interview on fox news scheduled to air wednesday night, trump was asked by an audience member what he would do to address “violence in the black community” and “black-on-black crime.” trump responded by proposing that “stop-and-frisk” policing, in which an officer is empowered to stop an individual and frisk them for weapons or any other illegal contraband, be adopted nationwide. story continued below “i would do stop-and-frisk. i think you have to. we did it in new york, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically,” trump told the questioner. “you understand, you have to have, in my opinion, i see what’s going on here, i see what’s going on in chicago, i think stop-and-frisk. in new york city it was so incredible, the way it worked. now, we had a very good mayor, but new york city was incredible, the way that worked, so i think that could be one step you could do.” the practice, carried out most famously in new york but also by other police departments, is frequently criticized as an avenue for officers commit acts of racial profiling. others tout it as responsible for a dramatic drop in new york city’s crime rate, although former nypd commissioner bill bratton said in 2015 that the practice is “not a significant factor in the crime rate of this city.”      trump calls for nationwide 'stop-and-frisk' policy      
__label__0 hillary clinton leads donald trump nationally by 6 percentage points among likely voters, according to an nbc news/wall street journal poll released wednesday afternoon. in a four-way race that includes libertarian nominee gary johnson and green party nominee jill stein, clinton tops the field with 43 support. trump follows at 37 percent, while johnson and stein trail at 9 percent and 3 percent, respectively. story continued below in a head-to-head between the two major party nominees, clinton’s lead expands to 7 percentage points, 48 percent to 41 percent. four percent of respondents said they would not vote for president, while 3 percent said they were undecided. among registered voters, a majority of support for clinton is just that — support for clinton (as opposed to support against trump). half of the registered voters backing clinton said their vote is more for clinton, while 44 percent characterized it as more against trump. on the republican side, only 41 percent of registered voters said their vote is for trump (51 percent said it was against clinton). registered voters gave trump the edge as the candidate who would be best in dealing with the economy, but they favored clinton when it came to dealing with immigration, changing the country for the better, being a good commander in chief and handling nuclear weapons. both candidates virtually tied on the issue of terrorism and national security, with clinton claiming a narrow 1-point advantage. clinton is still stuck with the stigma that she’s dishonest, though more voters believe she’s honest and straightforward now than in june. about 3-in-10 said she is honest and straightforward, a mark 10 percentage points lower than the 41 percent who identified trump as such. but it’s clinton who registered voters say has the right temperament, knowledge and experience to handle the presidency. while 56 percent said clinton has the right temperament and 60 percent said she has the knowledge and experience necessary to handle the job, just 23 percent said the same of trump on both issues. voters also said they care less about clinton’s recent health issues than trump’s taxes and cited the real estate mogul’s rhetoric toward women, immigrants and muslims; his temperament; clinton’s private server during her tenure as secretary of state; and her judgment in syria, iraq and libya as their top concerns. the survey of 922 likely voters was conducted sept. 16-19 via landline and cellphone. it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.      clinton leads trump by 6 points in nationwide poll      
__label__0 donald trump finally acknowledged president barack obama’s american birthplace last week, but one of his supporters, controversial arizona sheriff joe arpaio, sees a silver lining for the "birther" movement: trump didn't take a position on whether obama’s birth certificate was forged. “if he says the president was born here, maybe he has information i don’t have,” arpaio told politico of the gop nominee's statement. “he didn’t say the document was legitimate. he didn’t go that route.” story continued below of trump’s statement on obama’s birthplace, arpaio added: “it didn’t bother me.” arpaio, a prominent trump supporter known for his hard-line views on immigration, opened an investigation into the legitimacy of obama’s birth certificate in august 2011, several months after the white house published it online, further demonstrating that he was, in fact, born in hawaii. trump rose to political prominence in part through insinuating, falsely, that obama was not born in the united states — a claim the president’s supporters have long decried as racist. he backed down from it under pressure last week, in a short statement at an otherwise drawn-out press conference at his new luxury hotel in washington. trump also attempted to blame his opponent, hillary clinton, for starting the rumor, another claim independent fact checkers have debunked. but while trump has sought to sidestep the birther issue, arpaio has refused to back down from his own claim that obama’s birth certificate was forged. on tuesday in phoenix, arpaio addressed the conservative group that requested he investigate the document, saying that “we are looking at a forged document. period.” on wednesday, arpaio told politico the investigation into the document is ongoing. he declined to detail what evidence that effort has turned up, but he claimed that his office has found nothing “to say it’s a legitimate document.” arpaio also tried to separate himself from the birther movement, arguing that his investigation is focused on the document itself, rather than the president’s birthplace, and denied that his skepticism is motivated by racism. still, he would not say that he believes obama was born in the u.s. “i have no idea now where he was born,” arpaio said. “you hear a lot of stories.” he and trump did not discuss the birth certificate issue before the nominee held the press conference last week, arpaio said. “i didn’t know he was going to say it,” he said.      joe arpaio: trump didn’t call obama’s birth certificate ‘legitimate’      
__label__0 bill clinton doesn’t want his life's work to fade quietly into the night. in a personal speech defending his legacy at the clinton global initiative — from its humble roots in his harlem office to the international, star-studded conference it has become — the former president pleaded with the crowd wednesday evening that the work couldn't end. “you have to keep this alive,” he said. story continued below but in its current version, clinton's organization is dying. the former president's speech marked the official end of cgi, a glitzy, 12-year-old conference that convened fortune 500 ceos, movie stars, world leaders and nonprofit do-gooders in new york city during the united nations meeting. there, they forged partnerships and made commitments to collaborate on projects such as saving elephants, improving aids relief in africa and fighting for women’s rights across the globe. but with political pressure mounting as election day draws closer, the former president announced last month that the clinton foundation would stop accepting foreign and corporate donations if hillary clinton is elected president and that the annual cgi conference would cease its operations regardless of the outcome nov. 8. in what aides billed as a swan song for the big dog, clinton touted his organization as “a profound advance in the conduct and impact of modern philanthropy.” clinton, allies said, has been frustrated that the work he has devoted more than a decade of his life to has become what he thinks is a “smeared” political target in the 2016 race. the initiative and its parent organization, the clinton foundation, have been the target of regular attacks from republicans on the campaign trail, who allege that hillary clinton offered special treatment as secretary of state to individuals and nations who donated to the family’s charity. a series of emails from longtime hillary clinton aide huma abedin obtained by the conservative group judicial watch through a freedom of information act request appeared to show increased access to the former secretary of state and other power brokers for clinton foundation donors — a suggestion that the democratic nominee’s campaign has unequivocally denied. the former president saw the final cgi meeting that concluded wednesday evening as his best opportunity to change the narrative and explain himself. in a speech he was writing himself until the last minute, clinton detailed the work cgi has done both in the u.s. and abroad, defending his post-presidential legacy to date. the partners that worked together, he said, were “united only by a common mind-set, the belief that everyone has something to give and the obligation to give it, the belief that our actions really can make a difference and that as 21st century citizens, we all have a moral obligation to at least get caught trying to do that.” the former president, who was introduced by his daughter, said the initiative’s beginnings are rooted in harlem, where bill clinton first set out simply to be a good neighbor and help the businesses surrounding his post-administration office. he reminisced about raising money to rebuild rural parts of india after an earthquake and raising money for college for children of victims of the sept. 11 terrorist attacks. overall, cgi has helped 435 million people in 180 countries, clinton said. “you are living proof that good people committed to creative cooperation have almost unlimited positive impact to help people today and give our kids better tomorrows,” he said. “i have spent the past 15 years of my life trying to advance that idea.” “this is all that does work in the modern world. people may tell you you’re making incremental change,” he added. “but look back after 11 years and see what the aggregate is. there’s nothing incremental about helping 435 million people in 180 countries.” he made no explicit mention of his wife’s campaign or her opponent, donald trump, but his message dovetailed with what the democratic nominee was saying on the stump in orlando: that “love trumps hate.” “you have to cultivate a culture of possibility,” bill clinton said. “you have to know we can do more together than apart.”      bill clinton on cgi legacy: 'you have to keep this alive'      
__label__0 two months after snubbing donald trump at the republican convention, ted cruz is now praising the gop presidential nominee for inserting himself in congress' eleventh-hour negotiations over a government funding bill. on wednesday, trump urged congressional negotiators to delay a u.s. handoff of the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers, a private-sector, nonprofit organization that manages internet domain names. and that was enough to prompt cruz to laud trump — whom he pointedly declined to back in july when he urged republicans to "vote your conscience." story continued below "appreciate @realdonaldtrump’s support of our efforts to keep the internet free," cruz tweeted on wednesday afternoon. "and we appreciate @tedcruz appreciating @realdonaldtrump. over to you, @jeffroe," responded trump campaign manager kellyanne conway, referring to cruz's former campaign manager. and those warm words came after roe suggested at a bloomberg event that cruz may be rethinking his withheld endorsement. "i think he’ll have an answer before election day." roe said, according to texas tribune reporter patrick svitek. "to be honest ... watching donald run a better campaign lately has been helpful to him." cruz has made blocking the icann transition his central focus of the fall and has urged republicans to include a rider blocking the action in a must-pass spending bill this month. gop leaders have been generally supportive of the effort, and negotiators are increasingly likely to include some delay in the government funding measure, which will fund federal agencies through dec. 9. "it's still being worked," said senate commerce chairman john thune (r-s.d.). "i don't think it probably resolves anything beyond dec. 9." on tuesday, the senate voted to advance legislation that will eventually become the funding bill. cruz voted no.      cruz warms to trump      
__label__0 the campaign for senate control increasingly looks like a flip-of-the-coin affair — a 50-50 split after the election is not far-fetched. that could be a nightmare in the making for whoever wins the white house. story continued below any individual senator — from elizabeth warren on the left to ted cruz on the right — could almost single-handedly block the new president’s cabinet picks, depending on which party is in power. if you think the past several years of senate gridlock have been bad, that might look like a joy ride by comparison. “it’ll be a whole new shooting match,” said sen. john thune (r-s.d.). “one of the concerns that i have is that [with] the rancor of this campaign, everybody will feel like it’s still open season on whoever the elected president is,” said sen. heidi heitkamp (d-n.d.). “i hope we can get beyond that.” the senate’s unique power over confirmations means the chamber will be called upon early and often to ratify the cabinet selections of the new president, whether it’s hillary clinton or donald trump. the election outcome could have a big bearing on that: what once looked like a potential wave year for democrats has tightened to the point that an evenly divided senate has become a real possibility. that would leave virtually no margin for error when it comes to approving the president’s team next year. “we’re looking at a senate somewhere between 52 and 48. probably the outside numbers are 48 for one side and 52 for the other,” said sen. roy blunt (r-mo.), who himself is up for reelection. “it could be a tied senate.” that outcome would also present a new test for the relationship between capitol hill and the white house. the confirmation process has grown ever more partisan over the past 15 years, despite the move by democrats to weaken the filibuster so that all nominees except those to the supreme court can be confirmed by a simple majority. the most likely senate makeup is 51-49, or 50-50, in which case ties would be broken by the vice president. democrats fear that even if clinton wins but republicans keep the senate, the gop would drag its feet on her cabinet picks and hobble her administration out of the gate. “if you have president clinton and a republican-controlled senate, as we’ve seen with judicial appointments, the majority leader has the ability to obstruct virtually at will,” said sen. sheldon whitehouse (d-r.i.). “by refraining from bringing nominations to the floor, that could single-handedly prevent the president from confirming her team.” warning shots are already being fired. on wednesday, warren, a massachusetts democrat, gave a speech at the center for american progress that included a sharp signal to clinton not to pick insiders with ties to the financial industry for her administration. “when we talk about personnel, we don’t mean advisers who just pay lip service to hillary’s bold agenda, coupled with a sigh, a knowing glance and a twiddling of thumbs until it’s time for the next swing through the revolving door,” warren said. moderates are already entertaining what it will be like next year to hold the keys to clinton’s cabinet. five senators from red states are running for reelection, and several from purple states will be up for reelection, and any one of them could accrue effective veto power over nominees who rub them or their state the wrong way. “senators who are up in 2018 are already talking about it,” said senate minority whip dick durbin (d-ill.). the senate dynamics surrounding supreme court confirmations and legislation probably won’t shift much, since they need 60 votes to move forward. outgoing senate minority leader harry reid (d-nev.) recently urged democrats to scrap the supermajority requirement even for bills if they win back the chamber. but it’s unlikely the party would go there, at least for now. sen. brian schatz (d-hawaii), a stalwart liberal in the caucus, said he is “cautious” about dumping the 60-vote threshold on the legislative filibuster anytime soon. but “if the republicans are now into almost a decade of a lack of good faith and cooperation, then i think we have to reconsider everything,” schatz said. he added: “most of us are not anxious to move in that direction, but if we can’t function, then what is it exactly that we’re protecting?” republicans say that won’t be necessary. “i do hold out some hope that knowing [ascending democratic leader] sen. [chuck] schumer the way i do — he and i work well together — that we can find ways to build consensus,” said sen. john cornyn (r-texas). “it’s clear that voters don’t like the direction of the country now.” republicans say they hope to play nice on nominees, too — even if clinton is president. but there’s a lot of bad blood from the obama era: senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) kept attorney general loretta lynch waiting for weeks last year and has refused this year to fill a supreme court vacancy. democrats, for their part, changed the senate’s rules and spent more than a year in the majority confirming lifetime judges over the objections of gop leaders. gop senators said in interviews that the best way for the white house to get in sync with the senate is to begin voting on the least controversial judges and cabinet positions and get in a rhythm — rather than first take up nominees viewed as partisan or controversial. “the first ones that they send up will set the tone for a lot of that,” said sen. bob corker (r-tenn.), the senate foreign relations chairman. selecting “some radical,” he added, “would not be a great way to start the process.” and there are a couple of remaining moderates in the gop conference, most notably sen. susan collins of maine. she said that unless there are “integrity” issues with a nominee, she’s inclined to help confirm the person. that could be a lifeline for senate democrats if every confirmation vote turns into a squeaker. “i hope we’re not going to get into blocking cabinet nominees for the sake of blocking them,” collins said.      next president could face a 50-50 senate      
__label__0 donald trump has pulled ahead of hillary clinton among likely voters in a trio of swing states, according to a fox news poll released wednesday evening. in a four-way race that also includes libertarian gary johnson and green party candidate jill stein, trump leads clinton 43 percent to 40 percent in nevada, 45 percent to 40 percent in north carolina and 42 percent to 37 percent in ohio. story continued below johnson polled at 8 percent in nevada and at 6 percent in both north carolina and ohio. the only state in which stein registered any support was ohio, where she polled at 2 percent. president barack obama won all three states in 2008 and took ohio and nevada in his 2012 reelection campaign. all three are essential for trump, who faces a relatively narrow electoral path to the white house relative to clinton. the fox news poll is good news for the trump campaign after a fresh nbc news/wall street journal poll released earlier wednesday showed clinton with a 6-point lead nationwide. the fox poll also shows republican senate candidates in each state with leads over their democratic opponents. the biggest advantage of the three belongs to incumbent ohio sen. rob portman, who leads former ohio gov. ted strickland 51 percent to 37 percent. another incumbent, north carolina sen. richard burr, leads democrat deborah ross by 6 points, 43 percent to 37 percent, while gop rep. joe heck leads democrat catherine cortez masto by 7points, 43 percent to 36 percent, in the race to fill outgoing senate minority leader harry reid’s nevada senate seat. in north carolina’s gubernatorial race, republican gov. pat mccrory holds a small lead despite the still-swirling controversy surrounding his decision to sign into law a bill perceived by many to be discriminatory against transgender individuals. the incumbent gop governor leads his democratic challenger, north carolina attorney general roy cooper, by a 3-point margin, 46 percent to 43 percent. the fox news poll was conducted sept. 18-20 via both landlines and cellphones. it reached 704 likely voters in nevada, 734 in north carolina and 737 in ohio. the margin of error in all three states was plus-or-minus 3.5 points.      poll: trump leads clinton in ohio, nevada, north carolina      
__label__0 the top official in the country’s largest police union tweaked donald trump on wednesday for leaping to blame the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in tulsa, oklahoma. the fraternal order of police endorsed trump last week, and that endorsement still stands, said jim pasco, the group’s executive director. but of trump, said pasco, "he must be mindful of the due process rights and presumption of innocence accorded to all, including police officers.” story continued below trump has been reaching out to black voters in recent weeks, and on wednesday, the republican presidential nominee said he was “very, very troubled” by tuesday’s shooting of terence crutcher by officer betty shelby, and suggested her inexperience was to blame. "now, did she get scared? was she choking? what happened? but maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, okay? they can't be doing what they're doing,” trump said at a church in cleveland heights, ohio. "i watched the shooting in particular in tulsa. and that man was hands up,” trump continued. “that man went to the car, hands up, put his hand on the car. i mean, to me, it looked like he did everything you're supposed to do, and he looked like a really good man." the fraternal order of police boasts 330,000 members, most of whom are rank-and-file cops, from all over the country. last week, its national board voted to endorse trump, based on members’ votes at the state chapter level. trump’s law-and-order message and unequivocal support for police in other recent confrontations between cops and black men have made him popular with law enforcement, so his criticism of shelby was an unusual departure. clinton has sharply criticized the killings of both crutcher and keith lamont scott, whose death in charlotte, n.c., prompted protests even as police said he was armed. clinton said that such killings should “become intolerable” and touted the need for reform on wednesday, and the day before she spoke about “implicit bias” in the context of the tulsa incident. that prompted trump campaign manager kellyanne conway to attack clinton wednesday morning, saying on fox news, “it’s just unbelievable that she would do that before we even know the facts, the details. i think that’s an overpoliticization of a situation where we don’t know the facts.” conway’s remarks came before trump’s own suggestion that the officer choked.      police union knocks trump for suggesting tulsa officer choked      
__label__0 the “designated survivor” has long been one of washington’s favorite parlor games—imagining what america would be like if a catastrophe befell the capital during a state of the union and the most powerful office in the land were delivered unwittingly to the cabinet official who had been hidden away as the president-of-last-resort. what would america have looked like under president jeh johnson (2016)? president ernest moniz (2014)? or even president alberto gonzales (2007)? and then there are the weirder examples: in 2001, had a catastrophe occurred during the inauguration, americans expecting republican president george w. bush might have instead found themselves with a democratic president named larry summers. the idea is startling enough to fuel a new kiefer sutherland tv drama, designated survivor, in which the 24 actor plays a hapless housing and urban development secretary who finds himself ushered into the white house after a catastrophic attack on the capitol. story continued below you might assume that for something as important as presidential succession, the world's most powerful nation has it down to a science. that’s the scenario that hollywood lays out in the show premiere tonight: sutherland, who just minutes before had been headed to political obscurity in a low-profile ambassadorship, is instead ushered into the white house by an efficient set of government minders. but in reality, the system is far less clearly delineated, and dogged by questions that are likely to begin the moment it’s pressed into action. i’ve spent the last three years researching a forthcoming book on the government’s doomsday plans, and one fact that emerged starkly is just how uncertain the whole process is. the system of presidential succession is relatively new, and in many cases it's surprisingly unclear who becomes president. as legal scholar akhil amar, who had long studied the legalities of succession, told congress during one hearing after 9/11, “the current presidential succession act, 3 u.s.c. section 19, is in my view a disastrous statute, an accident waiting to happen. it should be repealed and replaced.” indeed, the presidential succession plan is the rare washington story that’s even stranger—and contains even more unexpected twists—than the hollywood version. for one thing, the system, known as “continuity of government,” is vastly larger and more complicated than most people realize. while attention usually focuses on the main presidential successor, during high-profile events a much broader shadow government often waits in secure undisclosed locations. during president obama’s inauguration in 2009, when defense secretary robert gates was the designated presidential successor, james clapper—then the undersecretary of defense for intelligence—waited out the swearing-in at the pentagon’s secret cold war bunker in pennsylvania known as raven rock, ready to step into gates’ role as defense secretary if the need arose. but the even weirder thing is what might happen after a disaster. in fact, had gates emerged from a cave to claim the presidency on january 20, 2009, it might’ve only marked the opening gambit in a legal drama that could have played out for days, weeks, or even months as a variety of officials from all three branches of government argued over who could rightfully claim the presidency. *** for about three hours the designated survivor teeters on the edge of becoming the most important person in the world. that moment in the spotlight—or, more accurately, far from the spotlight—can be brief. the night in 1997 agriculture secretary dan glickman served as the “designated survivor” during one of president clinton’s addresses to congress, glickman went to new york for the night, with a security detail and the nation’s nuclear codes in tow, only to find that as soon as the speech was finished—and the need for a successor over—the security apparatus abandoned him, leaving him in the rain to catch his own taxi home. the idea of a “designated survivor” was formalized by the carter and reagan administrations, as white house officials worried about nuclear missiles aboard soviet submarines that lay off the atlantic coast and could have devastated the capital with barely 10 minutes’ notice. president carter’s white house military office in april 1980 had instituted new procedures with fema to monitor the attendance of all presidential successors “at major, publicly announced functions outside the white house complex.” while such gatherings of the u.s. leadership had been commonplace in the past—at inaugurations, states of the union, state funerals and the like—the rising tensions of the cold war made government planners questions their wisdom. “the situation provides an inviting target to enemy attack or terrorist activity, and represents an unnecessary risk to national leadership,” the white house military office wrote, outlining the new procedures. the 25th amendment—itself a modern relic of the cold war and fears of nuclear attack—lays out a seemingly clear line for presidential succession. it flows from the vice president to the house speaker to the senate president pro tem, then through the cabinet in the order in which the departments were created—a quirk that itself makes the department of homeland security secretary, one of the people best qualified to actually assume the presidency in a disaster, actually last in line. when all those in the line of succession were gathered in a high-profile setting, fema was to notify the white house and an aide would recommend to the president which qualified cabinet successors should skip the event. (constitutionally, foreign-born cabinet secretaries, like current interior secretary sally jewell—a brit!—don’t serve in the line of succession.) it falls to a little-known branch of fema, the central locator service, to track the whereabouts of the successors daily, and once a month, after the fact, audit a single day to determine whether it had correctly known where each cabinet member was. the new white house and fema procedures got their first test at reagan’s inaugural. the incoming and outgoing administrations had agreed that carter’s outgoing defense secretary, harold brown, would remain in office past the standard noon departure and ensure that there was a national leader in case something catastrophic happened at the ceremony. “both sides agreed that something should be done,” a fema official explained later. brown only resigned later on inauguration day once the reagan team was firmly in control of government’s levers. the “designated survivor” program would grow more formal in the years to come—the chosen cabinet member would receive a secret service detail for the length of the event and a white house military aide would arrive for the evening with one of the emergency briefcases known as the “football,” which contain instructions on how to access the nation’s nuclear weapons codes—in case the unthinkable happened and the designated survivor needed to be ready to launch an attack. the “designated survivor” program, though, raised a new problem: how would the “designated survivor” prove he or she was actually now the president? the government lacked simple procedures for figuring out how to double-check that person’s identity after a decapitation event. is the person at the other end of the phone really agriculture secretary tom vilsack (state of the union 2012)? “one of the things we discovered is that there was no authentication system,” reagan’s first fema head louis giuffrida said in 1981. “if a successor got on the horn and said, ‘i’m the successor,’ and somebody said ‘prove it,’ [no one could]. so we’re working on that, and fema will be the authenticating mechanism to say, ‘yeah, this guy’s for real. the president’s gone and we don’t know where the vice president is…and this is the man.’” in the years ahead, fema and the white house worked out an elaborate (and classified) system through which a successor would be able to confirm his or her identity, and in subsequent years the “designated survivors” became a common part of washington lore, and often yielded amusing stories from those who served. health and human services secretary donna shalala recounted the story of how she watched the 1996 state of the union from the white house and ordered pizza. “i took my staff with me and i ordered pizza for them in the roosevelt room,” she said years later. “i went to the oval office and for one minute sat in the president's chair and then i got up respectfully and went to watch the speech with my staff.” yet, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, a bipartisan commission examining the nation’s succession planning found that odd—and troubling—quirks persisted that could lead to serious constitutional quandaries in just the sort of situation that kiefer sutherland’s character, secretary of housing and urban development tom kirkman, experiences in the tv show. as clear as the line of succession may appear on paper, legally it would likely prove a much messier proposition the further down the list you go and cabinet officials become involved. and it could get particularly tangled if the president or vice president is only “incapacitated,” rather than killed outright. it’s not entirely clear, even, that the house speaker or the senate president pro tem could legally serve as president. republican senator john coryn raised the question during the debate in the early 2000s of what would happen if a speaker of the house or senate president pro tem ascended to the presidency—and then was challenged by the secretary of state who argued that the legislators didn’t count as constitutional officers, making them ineligible to serve in the presidency. “believe it or not, the secretary actually has a rather strong case, in my view,” cornyn said. no less an authority than james madison himself had argued that the congressional leaders were legislators, not constitutional officers, and thus ineligible to succeed to the presidency. as cornyn said, “who is the president? whose orders should be followed by our armed forces, by our intelligence agencies and by domestic law enforcement bureaus? if law suits are filed, will courts accept jurisdiction? how long will they take to rule? how will they rule? and how will their rulings be respected?” in the years after 9/11, the so-called “continuity of government commission,” pushed by american enterprise institute scholar norm ornstein, who has assumed the role of washington’s succession cassandra and has spent much of the last 20 years raising troubling questions about the 25th amendment’s ambiguities, confronted one of the strangest and most nettlesome phrases in “cog” operations. it’s a seemingly unnecessary aside in the language guiding presidential succession known as the “supplantation clause,” which held that a “prior-entitled” presidential successor, that is someone who ranks higher in the official line of succession, could supplant a lower-level cabinet official who was serving as “acting president.” for instance, in a situation where the president and the congressional leadership was killed, but the vice president only incapacitated, the secretary of state would presumably serve as “acting president” until the vice president was able to resume his or her responsibility and become the president. but the “supplantation clause” inserted unhelpful ambiguity: could, after congress reconstitutes itself, a newly elected speaker of the house or senate president pro tem insist on replacing the secretary of state even after that person had assumed the office of “acting president”? could a newly elected speaker supplant a president pro tem? might the presidency swing wildly in a few days, at the height of a crisis, between different officials and different political parties? the continuity of government commission tried also to tackle an ongoing problem with presidential succession that had dogged the debate for decades: even with the idea of designated survivors for major high-profile gatherings and all the evacuation systems in place, on a day-to-day basis everyone in the presidential line of succession lives and works in a tiny radius extending a few miles around the white house and the capitol. “in the nightmare scenario of terrorists detonating a nuclear device, it is possible that everyone in the line of succession might be killed,” the commission’s executive director, john fortier, told congress during one hearing. “imagine the aftermath: a parade of generals, governors, and under secretaries claiming to be in charge.” it would be the chaos of al haig’s “i’m in control here” statement during the reagan administration writ larger and more fraught. one proposal, floated during the post-9/11 discussions, would have created a “first secretary,” a cabinet official who would have been first-in-line to the presidency after the vice president and whose sole responsibility would be to remain outside of washington and be the designated survivor to head the shadow government if a catastrophic event destroyed the capital. it would be a job, in essence, to remain in an “undisclosed location” until the worst moment of american history. * * * such questions make the nation, under existing rules, particularly vulnerable during presidential inaugurations. the terms of the president and vice president constitutionally expire at noon on january 20th, but their cabinets remained in office until either a resignation is tendered or a successor is confirmed by the senate—which usually doesn’t happen for hours or even days after an inauguration. in 2001, as fortier, the commission leader explained, a terror attack that targeted george w. bush’s inauguration, might have left the nation with a president carried over from the previous administration who would then serve until congress had a speaker or president pro tem who would “bump” out the president and serve the rest of the four-year term of office. fortier said, “a country expecting republican george w. bush to take office would have found themselves with a democratic president larry summers. as secretary of the treasury, summers was the highest-ranking clinton cabinet member eligible to serve as president.” in 1989, at george h.w. bush’s inauguration, the situation would have been even more confusing, with the same strange outcome: michael armacost, the number three official at reagan’s state department, would have been elevated to president of the united states, for the outgoing secretary of state, george shultz, and deputy secretary of state, john c. whitehead, had both resigned before the inauguration. then, with the house in democratic hands, a newly chosen speaker could have bumped armacost and given the nation four years of democratic rule immediately after it elected a republican president. in fact, given that the senate took five days to confirm james baker as secretary of state after bush’s inauguration, armacost remained fourth in line to the presidency for the better part of a week. armacost went on to serve as president of the brookings institution and summers went on to serve as president of harvard university, so both men ended up with the title of “president,” but—had an unprecedented crisis summoned them to lead in 1989 or 2001—it’s hard to imagine that the ascension of either man to the american presidency would have proved reassuring to the nation in its moment of need. unless kiefer sutherland’s drama reopens the debate, there are no plans to fix any of these—or a host of other—problems with presidential succession. congress tabled and ignored the fixes on the table a decade ago, and except for a few lonely congressional voices in the years since, like rep. brian baird, there’s been little attention since. so, as you tune in to watch kiefer sutherland heroically step in and lead the nation on tv, know that you’re perhaps watching the ultimate hollywood fiction: the idea that the government’s doomsday plans would actually work.      who’s in charge of america after a catastrophe? who knows?      
__label__0 donald trump's campaign wednesday criticized the obama administration's plan to hand oversight of the internet's domain name system to an international body, echoing sen. ted cruz's argument that it could lead to more censorship by countries like russia and china. "the u.s. should not turn control of the internet over to the united nations and the international community. president obama intends to do so on his own authority — just 10 days from now, on october 1st, unless congress acts quickly to stop him," trump's national policy director, stephen miller, said in a statement published on the campaign's website. story continued below "the republicans in congress are admirably leading a fight to save the internet this week, and need all the help the american people can give them to be successful. hillary clinton’s democrats are refusing to protect the american people by not protecting the internet," miller wrote. "internet freedom is now at risk with the president’s intent to cede control to international interests, including countries like china and russia, which have a long track record of trying to impose online censorship," the statement continued. "congress needs to act, or internet freedom will be lost for good, since there will be no way to make it great again once it is lost." cruz, who has famously refused to endorse trump's candidacy, thanked the gop nominee in a tweet: "appreciate @realdonaldtrump’s support of our efforts to stop obama’s internet handover & keep the #internet free." the texas senator has repeatedly slammed the administration's plan to transfer domain-name oversight to the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers, a global non-profit. tech companies have supported the plan, and the commerce department says it was always envisioned that u.s. oversight of the internet would be temporary. cruz and other republicans have called for the internet transition to be blocked as part of the continuing resolution that keeps the government running beyond sept. 30. hillary clinton, in her tech policy platform, says she supports the transition as a "critical step towards safeguarding the internet’s openness for future generations."      trump joins cruz in attacking obama's internet plan

__label__0 scratch one big economic worry off the list for hillary clinton. federal reserve policymakers on wednesday kept their key interest rate steady, avoiding a potential stock market disruption and putting the central bank on the sidelines until after election day. story continued below fed chair janet yellen also strongly rejected claims lobbed at her by gop presidential nominee donald trump that she is keeping rates artificially low to boost stock prices and aid democrats. “i can say emphatically that partisan politics plays no role in our decisions about the appropriate stance of monetary policy,” yellen said at a news conference after the fed announced its decision. “we do not discuss politics at our meetings and we do not take politics into account in our decisions.” nonetheless, the fed’s actions can have significant political consequences. the federal open market committee’s decision means voters are not likely to see big stock-price declines or a slowing economy before the nov. 8 election. clinton is counting on slowly improving views of the economy to hold off a late surge from trump, who has made dissatisfaction with the sluggish pace of growth a centerpiece of his populist campaign. stocks rose following the fed’s announcement. “the clinton campaign should absolutely breathe a sigh of relief, because the market was just not positioned at all for a rate increase; there would have been total chaos,” said brett ewing, chief market strategist at first franklin financial services. “less drama is clearly good for the incumbent party.” at her news conference, yellen said she saw improvement in the u.s. economy but little evidence of risky inflation. and she said holding off on a hike could allow more people to come back into the labor force. “we are generally pleased with how the u.s. economy is doing,” she said. “the economy has a little more room to run than might have been previously thought, and that’s good news. and remember that inflation continues below 2 percent.” the move cheered investors who have driven stocks to fresh highs this year in large part fueled by the fed’s continued easy money policy. yellen and the fed also offered reassuring words about the state of the economy while pointing to a possible rate hike in december. “[t]he labor market has continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year,” the fed said in its eagerly awaited statement wednesday. “the committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened but decided, for the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives.” the fed’s decision on wednesday is not a complete victory for the clinton campaign. by declining yet again to raise rates, the world’s most powerful central bank is signaling that it does not believe the u.s. economy is strong enough for even the slightest tightening of monetary policy. the fed raised rates in december for the first time in nearly a decade. but it has been unwilling to do so again despite an unemployment rate of just 4.9 percent and warnings that inflation could spike in ways that would be difficult for the fed to control. the fed’s target rate is now just 0.25 percent to 0.50 percent, a remarkably low figure this late in an economic recovery that gives the central bank little room to maneuver should a new crisis or recession arise. so the fed’s move avoids a market meltdown but offers fresh rhetorical evidence for trump and other republicans who argue that the economy is extraordinarily weak. “it’s certainly better for clinton not to have a negative market reaction, but the story here is also that fed does not have high confidence in continued improvement in the economy,” said michael obuchowski of merlin asset management. “and that’s something trump can talk about, that the economy is so weak the fed can’t do anything even though it wants to.” the fed also reduced its outlook for economic growth this year to 1.8 percent from 2 percent while keeping projections for 2 percent growth over the next two years unchanged. trump has made bashing the fed a central plank in his presidential campaign, repeatedly blasting yellen as motivated by a desire to protect democrats. “she’s obviously political and doing what obama wants her to do,” trump said on cnbc earlier this month. “i think she’s very political, and to a certain extent, i think she should be ashamed of herself.” trump has also said that as president he would replace yellen, whose term runs until february 2018. and he has ripped the fed for creating what he has called a “false economy” with high stock prices but only modest wage gains and a very low labor-force participation rate. yellen pushed back hard on the criticism on wednesday. “the federal reserve is not politically compromised,” she said. “i can’t recall any meeting that i have ever attended where politics has been a matter of discussion. i think the public if they had been watching our meeting on tv today would have felt that we had a rich, deep, serious, intellectual debate about the risks and the forecasts for the economy.” yellen added that the central bank “struggled mightily with trying to understand each other’s points of view and come out at a balanced place and act responsibly, and that’s my commitment to the american people.” still, some fed governors appear to agree with at least elements of trump’s critique. three members of the fed’s policy-setting committee voted against the latest decision, the largest number in two years. these governors argued for a quarter-point increase. some market observers note, however, that investors have already done some of the fed’s work by pushing up borrowing costs and generally tightening financial conditions without the fed having to make an official policy move. “why does the fed have to do anything if someone else is already doing the heavy lifting for them?” said david kotok, chief investment officer at cumberland advisors. “why break your back?” as for 2016, kotok said the decision should be a bit of a boost for clinton, more because it avoids a nightmare scenario than does much to strengthen the economy. “this at least doesn’t hurt her,” he said. “whether it actually helps is another question.”      yellen helps clinton dodge a bullet      
__label__0 iranian president hassan rouhani on wednesday expressed confidence that the landmark nuclear deal between his country and a group of world powers will be able to weather the volatile u.s. election season. msnbc's chuck todd asked rouhani whether he'd rather work with hillary clinton or donald trump, citing comments they've made on the nuclear deal. rouhani said, "of course, throughout the atmosphere of presidential elections in the united states, candidates can bring up any topic that they see best suits the needs of their campaigns. but the reality remains that when the joint comprehensive plan of action was passed based on the united nations security council resolution 2231, and it was approved unanimously, that became an international agreement." story continued below trump has repeatedly criticized the iran nuclear deal, calling it a "bad deal" and previously said he would tear it up. he's also called the obama administration incompetent over it. clinton, on the other hand, has said she would respect the deal, yet be cautious in dealing with iran, in what's come to be known as her "distrust and verify" strategy. "no one can say here or there that i don't accept this agreement, i want to renegotiate it. this has purely an electoral effect for some," rouhani said.      rouhani: iran deal able to weather the election      
__label__0 donald trump said wednesday he decided to finally address his "birther" controversy "to get on with the campaign" and discuss issues like the economy and the threat of terrorism. speaking to ohio's abc6, the republican nominee said, "i just wanted to get on with, i wanted to get on with the campaign. a lot of people were asking me questions. we want to talk about jobs. we want to talk about the military. we want to talk about isis and get rid of isis. we want to talk about bringing jobs back to this area because you've been decimated so we just wanted to get back on the subject of jobs, military, taking care of our vets, etc." story continued below the republican nominee had been pressed to explain why he refused to acknowledge president barack obama's birthplace as the united states -- a fact he questioned for years prior to becoming a presidential candidate. trump conceded during an announcement last friday that “president barack obama was born in the united states, period."

__label__0 a billionaire who built up a corporate empire from his father’s inheritance now is running his first major political campaign with a promise to shake up the establishment and restore prosperity after a long period of stagnation. but in this case it’s not donald trump. it’s jim justice, the democratic candidate for governor in west virginia and a coal baron to boot. like trump, justice has been accused of not paying his bills and being out mainly for himself. and like trump, justice is running a nontraditional campaign that exists well outside the partisan pattern, eschewing hillary clinton and barack obama in favor of a cult of personality based around his exploits in business. as west virginia’s only billionaire, he can self-fund, pumping $2.2 million into his campaign through mid-june. justice faces stiff crosswinds, however, running as a down-ballot democrat in one of trump’s strongest states. story continued below west virginia polling is scarce and often inaccurate, but a metronews west virginia poll released earlier this month showed trump with a 49–31 advantage over hillary clinton, who won only 36 percent to bernie sanders’ 51 percent in the state’s may 10 primary. in an era of declining split-ticket voting, justice must outperform clinton by double digits to win. that’s led to a dynamic in which west virginia’s gop candidate for governor, state senate president bill cole, is embracing trump while justice is distancing himself from clinton. it’s very nearly the opposite of what’s happening in other states with close races. “across the nation, democrats are trying to nationalize their races because they think they can use trump as a weapon. in this race, it’s pretty clear democrats are trying to localize, because trump is not a drag but an asset for cole,” says kyle kondik, managing editor of larry sabato’s crystal ball at the university of virginia’s center for politics. “this is one of the few places in the country where republicans are more concerned with nationalizing a race than democrats are.” in this race, trump isn’t a drag on republicans; he’s an asset. the reason is simple: coal. republicans have dominated appalachia the past three cycles by bludgeoning democrats with “war on coal” rhetoric blaming obama for the industry's decline. it’s hard to make that charge stick against a coal baron. and justice definitely qualifies: he inherited an array of coal interests from his father, then enlarged them to become one of the biggest private coal mine owners in the east. that growth included the 2009 sale of his bluestone coal corp. to russia’s oao mechel for $568 million. then the coal slump hit, and last year justice bought bluestone back for $5 million, less than 1 percent of his selling price. cole, the republican candidate, has more elective experience than justice, but he’s no establishment insider. owner of bill cole automall and other businesses, cole is finishing only his first term in the west virginia senate, having previously served a few months in the house of delegates when he was appointed to fill a vacant seat. however, cole spent much of 2016 wrapped up in a state budget crisis and has focused his general election campaign on tried-and-true conservative policy proposals such as cutting spending and taxes, banning late-term abortions and opening charter schools. in a year in which voters largely have embraced personality over policy, that may not be enough, even in a republican-tilting state with a wildly popular candidate at the top of the ticket. “if you think about the primary races here, we saw a giant trump win and a giant sanders win,” says scott crichlow, associate professor of political science at west virginia university. “if you look at trump, look at sanders, look at justice, they certainly have policies that are known—the wall, universal health care, the coal industry—but so much of what’s driving the appeal for them is personality and image, not just a list of policy prescriptions.” justice is running as a conservative democrat, not unlike former governor and current u.s. sen. joe manchin, with whom he shares a number of campaign staff. he’s flip-flopped between the two major parties, giving money to both and changing his registration, most recently in february 2015, when he became a democrat. however, he says he won’t vote for clinton and dismissed cole’s claim that he supports obama as “complete dog snot.” and while justice spokesman grant herring says his candidate “isn’t focused on the national political circus,” the language he uses to describe his appeal sounds awfully familiar. “jim is no politician,” says herring. “he is the outsider in this race who has the skills and experience to transform the state.” at the moment, it looks like that approach is working: a metronews west virginia poll released september 3 showed justice running away with the race at 46 percent, cole with 32 percent, mountain party candidate charlotte pritt with 8 percent, and libertarian david moran with 5 percent. many doubt the veracity of the metronews poll, which has varied wildly when measured against election results in recent years, but most, including cole spokesman kent gates, agree that justice is winning. “do i think justice has a lead? yes,” says gates. “do i think it’s double digits? no.” some of that is because justice’s industry ties largely make him resistant to the gop’s otherwise effective “war on coal” messaging, which has proven to be democrat kryptonite around appalachia, even in districts beyond the coalfields. “if you’re going to win in west virginia, you better be running against hillary clinton,” says dave “mudcat” saunders, a western virginia political consultant known for his so-called bubba strategy, designed to help democrats appeal to white working-class voters. saunders, who has said he’s voting for trump, says voters don’t trust clinton or care about her support for funding going to help coalfield economies transition to something else. “she said she’s going to put coal out of business. west virginia coal miners don’t want a handout. they want their dignity. they want their jobs.” if you’re going to win in west virginia, you better be running against hillary clinton,” says one democratic strategist. but saunders doesn’t have kind words for justice either: “he’s screwed every coal operator in west virginia at one time or another.” cole sees that reputation as his big opening. his spokesman, gates, says the republican campaign will open up attacks on justice’s business record over the next several weeks. “jim justice is a coal operator, but he’s not a coal operator acting in the best interest of west virginia,” gates says. “his legacy of unpaid bills is documented across the land.” that record extends from unpaid federal fines to unpaid vendors to unpaid state and local taxes in multiple states. in a 2014 series on delinquent mines, npr reported that justice “stands out” among mining operators, owing nearly $2 million in unpaid fines at the time. that same year, a federal agency issued 39 cessation orders against three justice companies for reclamation violations at tennessee mines, including hiring a contractor who planted trees upside down. the problems have persisted. this year in kentucky, justice’s mines missed reclamation deadlines and owed nearly $2 million in delinquent property taxes. that’s an improvement from last year, when he owed $3.5 million in unpaid kentucky taxes. in southwest virginia, tazewell county officials seized machinery, tools and other equipment from a justice-owned mine this spring to make up for $850,000 in unpaid property taxes. when 2015 west virginia property taxes became delinquent in april, justice owed more than $3.9 million. the pattern apparently extends to justice’s other businesses, as well: two companies sued the greenbrier for unpaid work on its golf courses for the pga tournament, eventually settling out of court. justice’s mining record, which includes extensive use of mountaintop removal mining, as well as his issues with mine reclamation, has made him the target of many an appalachian environmental activist. the cole campaign going negative on justice might not push those green voters to vote republican, but it might tip them toward pritt, who is running for governor as the candidate of the mountain party, the west virginia affiliate of the green party. pritt served eight years in the state legislature and is making her third run for governor. the last time she ran, in 1996, she defeated manchin in a primary on the way to a loss in the general election. both cole and justice have promised to bring back coal jobs, but whoever wins in november faces the monumental task of a state economy that’s suffered mightily with the collapse of the coal industry. according to the u.s. census, west virginia’s 2014 median household income was $41,576, compared with $53,657 nationally. its poverty rate was 18.3 percent, versus 14.8 nationally. mining jobs have plummeted, falling 19 percent in the past calendar year, 26 percent from a decade ago, and 39 percent from 2011, when the market for metallurgical, or steel-making, coal spiked on the strength of a then-strong asian economy. mines sit idle as a string of industry giants— alpha natural resources, arch coal, patriot coal, peabody energy and walter energy—filed for bankruptcy due to a convergence of factors including a slumping asian economy, competition from cheap natural gas, and federal clean-air regulations that resulted in a wave of older power plants closing or converting to natural gas. while the market for metallurgical, or steel-making coal may eventually return, it’s unlikely the same will be true for steam, or power-producing, coal. the coal industry’s struggles haven’t just hurt west virginia’s employment rate, but also its state budget. the reduction in coal and natural gas severance tax collection contributed to its budget crisis, along with an economy that generally has failed to transition from its fossil fuel roots. in this gubernatorial campaign, neither candidate seems eager to push that process forward. justice, however, has experience operating in economic sectors such as farming and tourism that may be part of the recipe for recovery. he previously owned wintergreen resort in virginia before selling it last year, and in 2009 he bought the famed greenbrier resort out of bankruptcy. since then, he’s brought an annual pga tournament and the new orleans saints’ training camp to the greenbrier. in late june, a month and a half after justice won the democratic nomination and two weeks before the greenbrier classic pga tournament was scheduled to start, tragedy inadvertently threw a spotlight on the greenbrier and the communities around it when west virginia was slammed by historic rains and flooding that qualified as a 1,000-year event in parts of the state. twenty-three people were killed, including 15 in greenbrier county, and hundreds of homes were destroyed. justice canceled the pga event and closed the greenbrier resort, though it opened its doors, free of charge, to house about 200 people who had been displaced from their homes. he shut down his campaign for roughly 10 days following the flooding, appearing only at a brief press conference to announce the greenbrier’s reopening date. should he win in november, however, his response to the flooding and actions at the greenbrier will be remembered as a defining moment. whether justice will win, however, remains an open question, double-digit poll lead notwithstanding. sabato’s crystal ball recently moved the west virginia governor’s race from “leans republican” to “toss-up.” “we’re being cautious because of the fact that justice will need to run so far ahead of clinton,” kondik says. trump will easily win west virginia, but the winner of the governor’s race will be determined by how willing voters are to split their tickets, and whether democrats remain loyal to their party or break for pritt. that’s why cole’s campaign is attacking justice on his record as a coal businessman, even as they decry the federal “war on coal.” whether those voters go to cole or to pritt ultimately doesn’t matter, so long as they’re not voting for justice. in his attacks on justice, cole spokesman gates repeated one line a couple of times: “at the end of the day, jim justice is going to do what’s best for jim justice.” that line has been used about donald trump, too. the question for west virginia voters on election day will be whether what’s in justice and trump’s best interests is in theirs, too.      is west virginia holding america’s weirdest election?      
__label__0 a federal magistrate has turned down a request from defense lawyers that the man accused of the weekend bombings in new york and new jersey be immediately arraigned on a set of federal charges he is facing. manhattan-based u.s. magistrate judge gabriel gorenstein agreed with federal prosecutors that suspect ahmad rahami need not have an initial federal court appearance until he is taken into federal custody. and, by all appearances, he's currently in the custody of local officials in new jersey, the magistrate said. "the [federal] government explicitly denies that it has arrested the defendant. there is no evidence to the contrary," gorenstein wrote in a two-page order released wednesday evening. gorenstein noted that defense lawyers said "it is undisputed that federal law enforcement are involved in detaining and questioning" rahami. "in fact, this question is very much in dispute," the magistrate wrote. "the government asserts unequivocally that the defendant 'is not in federal custody ... whether there are federal authorities questioning defendant does not address the issue of custody. at this point, the court has no evidence whatsoever from anyone with personal knowledge that the defendant is being detained by any federal officer." the magistrate also rejected defense lawyers' claims that a federal court rule requires rahami be promptly arraigned on the federal charges even if he is arrested by state authorities. gorenstein not only declined to schedule a court appearance for rahami, who's at a newark hospital and could have been arraigned there, but said he lacks authority to appoint the court's indigent defense providers at the federal defenders of new york to formally represent rahami. attorney general loretta lynch said wednesday morning that rahami will be brought to new york city in the "near future" to face the federal complaint there, which is expected to take precedence over attempted murder charges filed in county court in new jersey and another federal complaint in the garden state. a spokesman for u.s. attorney preet bharara’s office declined to comment on the decision, saying the ruling could speak for itself. the defense attorney who asked for the arraignment, james patton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the magistrate’s decision.      magistrate won't order federal arraignment for bombing suspect      
__label__0 hillary clinton will almost certainly win monday night’s epic presidential debate on points — and still could lose. it’s hard to see how clinton, who has marinated in public policy for 30 years and is preparing for the debate like it is the invasion of normandy, won’t repeatedly best donald trump on substance. story continued below her strength in this area perfectly matches trump’s weakness. trump has appeared to learn for the first time such basic information as that the trans-pacific partnership doesn’t include china and that russia has already invaded ukraine on the debate stage or during a media interview. he sometimes reads his speeches as if they include revelations to him — “so true,” he’ll interject after coming across a striking fact or observation in the text. if trump has spent time hitting the briefing books, his campaign has kept it under wraps and he has yet to reveal any hint of a new policy depth in anything he’s said over the past few weeks. so trump won’t be particularly well-informed, and figures it won’t particularly matter — and may well be right. trump has a significant built-in advantage in that there is a lower standard for him — not because the media isn’t tough enough on him, as all the media mavens agree, but because he is the de facto challenger and candidate of change in a change election. trump can win by clearing a bar of acceptability, whereas clinton has to do more than that and either significantly wound trump or make a compellingly positive case for herself that has so far eluded her in both 2008 and 2016. this is not to say that trump won’t be on treacherous terrain. he can’t bully and mock clinton the way he did his republican rivals. he won’t have a crowd to feed off of. without a teleprompter, message discipline still tends to elude him. the one-on-one format for an hour-and-a-half could make his thin knowledge painfully obvious. and any misstep or outburst that reinforces the idea that he lacks the qualities to be commander in chief would be devastating. but trump just needs to seem plausible and the very fact that he is on a presidential debate stage, the most rarified forum in american politics, will benefit him. during the republican primary debates, the intangibles worked in his favor and they presumably will on monday, too. trump is a big personality with a dominant physical presence. his critics often sneeringly say he is a reality tv star, but you don’t become one without charisma and a performative ability that are major political assets. the fact is that trump will have to stumble badly — and probably sabotage himself — to live down to hillary’s critique of him. she has made her campaign almost entirely about how trump is a monstrous madman. this was an understandable calculation — she wanted to disqualify him out of the box and differentiate and isolate him from other republicans. the cost is that she has done more than anyone to lower the standard for trump. it’s not as though he needs to mount a convincing, detailed defense of his tax or child care plan or anything else to invalidate clinton’s critique of him; he just needs to seem a reasonable person. that is why trump doesn’t need to be the aggressor. as long as he’s firm and calm, he is implicitly rebutting the case against him on temperament. and then he can look for a big moment or two that will be memorable and drive the post-debate conversation in the media that is arguably as important as the debate itself. these contests aren’t evaluated by college-debate judges. trump won one of the republican primary debates with his barbed quip in response to vicente fox’s vulgar declaration that mexico wouldn’t pay for the wall, “the wall just got 10 feet higher.” this wasn’t an argument or a policy; it was a sentiment. no one would have written it down in a briefing book. and yet, it punched through. if trump has taught us anything, it is that simple, evocative statements can make up for a multitude of evasions and confused non-answers. in the past, most presidential debates have had a slight or ephemeral effect on the race. monday could be different because it is an event tailor-made for trump to change one of the main factors holding him back. by roughly 60 percent to 30 percent, people think clinton is prepared to be president; by roughly 60 percent to 30 percent, people think trump is not. a credible performance could move that number for trump, and appreciably increase his odds of winning the presidency. hillary is both formidably well-prepared for monday, and at significant risk. such is the dynamic of the race and the way most voters absorb information that she could “win” on points, and still lose ground.      how trump could win the debate

am cet hillary clinton with barack obama at the democratic convention | mandel ngan/afp via getty images when hillary clinton resigned as u.s. secretary of state in 2013, beijing wasn’t sorry to see her go. in her four years in office, the former first lady and senator had gained a reputation in china as a source of hostility in an administration that had otherwise tried to be accommodating. in particular, clinton rankled beijing by rallying china’s neighbors against its maneuvers in the south china sea. shortly after she was succeeded by john kerry, china’s state-controlled global times wrote that “for the chinese people, the hard line of former us secretary of state hillary clinton has been unforgettable.” to fans of clinton’s tough-minded approach to foreign policy, the description was a badge of honor — and an example of how her approach to the world will differ from u.s. president barack obama’s if she is elected in november. “if you ask the chinese or the japanese or the australians, they’ll tell you clinton is the realist, the balance-of-power person,” said michael green, who served as senior director for asia on george w. bush’s national security council. green, now senior vice president for asia at the center for strategic and international studies in washington, briefed clinton and her team twice on asian affairs and came away impressed. he is also one of 50 republican foreign policy experts who signed a letter this summer denouncing the party’s nominee, donald trump. clinton has long described her iraq vote as a mistake, but she has since taken a series of other stands that have bolstered a reputation for hawkishness. a clinton white house would undoubtedly provide u.s. foreign policy with a dose of continuity — especially when compared to the wild-card uncertainty of a trump presidency. but the former top diplomat would also bring an alternative approach to statecraft. and she would also face a different set of domestic and geopolitical limitations, particularly when it comes to trade and the relationship between the u.s. and europe. where obama is cerebral and deliberative, the narrative goes, clinton does her homework but is quicker to make decisions. where obama points out the united states’ historic failings and missteps, clinton, a child of the cold war and an advocate of nato expansion, is firmly in the “american exceptionalism” camp. “i believe we are still lincoln’s ‘last, best hope of earth,’” she said in an august 31 speech in ohio. “we’re still reagan’s ‘shining city on a hill.’ we’re still robert kennedy’s ‘great, unselfish, compassionate country.’” at a time when most americans seem averse to putting boots on the ground just about anywhere, clinton’s team has described her approach as “more muscular” than obama’s — with its reliance on drones and special forces operations — and perhaps better suited to the current international environment. and, of course, there’s the 2002 vote in congress authorizing military action in iraq. her “yes” vote probably cost her the party’s nomination in 2008. clinton has long described her iraq vote as a mistake, but she has since taken a series of other stands that have bolstered a reputation for hawkishness. she argued against a drastic drawdown of u.s. troops in afghanistan and supported an intervention in libya, decisions that put her at odds with many in her party. clinton has pledged to keep u.s. ground troops out of syria. chinese officials are thought to be wary of a clinton presidency. her adversarial approach to beijing dates back to 1995, when, as first lady, she famously said that “women’s rights are human rights” at the united nations fourth world conference on women in beijing. and during her tenure as secretary of state, her team pushed back during bilateral negotiations when beijing sought to expand the number of issues it deemed to be chinese “core interests,” along the lines of tibet and taiwan. also on politico ryan heath also on politico ryan heath also on politico matthew karnitschnig also on politico janosch delcker also on politico julia gillard it is important to note, however, that many of clinton’s top officials are likely to be holdovers from the current or previous administrations, making sharp breaks in policy unlikely. her top foreign policy aide and likely national security advisor is jake sullivan, who played a key role in the u.s. opening up to myanmar and advised on the iran nuclear deal implemented after clinton left office. former u.s. ambassador to russia michael mcfaul has served as a high-profile surrogate when it comes to russia, and observers expect him to play a role in a clinton administration. on asia, former assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs kurt campbell, an architect of the obama administration’s so-called asia pivot, is likely to play a large role in a clinton presidency. many expect to see former under secretary of defense for policy michelle flournoy, who worked on russia and ukraine, in a top job. the biggest difference between obama and clinton is likely to be less about military deployments or diplomatic showdowns than about economic policy. historically, clinton has been a proponent of free trade. but in the last year, the anti-trade sentiment that helped boost the candidacies of trump, and clinton’s primary opponent, u.s. senator bernie sanders, has pushed her to the left on the issue. that could leave her far more constrained than her predecessors, including her husband and obama, when it comes to trade deals. she’s already disavowed the trans-pacific partnership (tpp), the free-trade agreement for which she helped lay the groundwork during her time in foggy bottom. and her statements on the campaign trail call into question whether she would rush to strike a deal on the transatlantic trade and investment partnership (ttip), which she described as an “economic nato” in 2012. as with all presidents, however, clinton’s foreign policy would less likely be governed by grand strategy than by the geopolitical landscape and unfolding events. and the world, to put it lightly, looks different than it did when clinton last held office. “it’s not the europe of the clinton era of the 1990s and it’s not even the europe of the beginning of the obama administration” — fiona hill, director at the brookings institution the war in syria and the rise of the islamic state have dramatically destabilized the middle east. china’s president, xi jinping, is re-asserting the country’s dominance in east asia. north korea is widely believed to be on the verge of developing a nuclear weapon that could threaten the continental united states. russian president vladimir putin has annexed crimea and is intent on being a player, or at least a spoiler, in syria — and perhaps in the u.s. elections themselves. but nowhere has the landscape been more drastically altered than europe. obama’s detached nature, combined with controversies over the u.s. spying on its allies, left many europeans disappointed. but since then, much has changed, as a spate of terrorist attacks, a worrying refugee crisis and the decision by the united kingdom to leave the european union upended the status quo. “it’s not the europe of the clinton era of the 1990s and it’s not even the europe of the beginning of the obama administration,” said fiona hill, the director of the center on the united states and europe at the brookings institution and a former national intelligence officer on the national intelligence council. the question, experts say, is whether clinton would see the eu as an ally, or as a problem to be managed. patrick cronin, a senior advisor at the center for a new american security and a top official at the u.s. agency for international development under george w. bush, expects a greater emphasis by her on personal relationships with eu leaders than obama. “she’ll be stronger on the transatlantic relationship than obama was initially,” said cronin. added hill, “clinton is coming in at a moment where she’s going to have to be much more of a leader with respect to europe.”  © 2016

__label__0 north carolina gov. pat mccrory called for a state of emergency in charlotte wednesday night after violence escalated as residents continued to protest the fatal shooting of an african-american man by a police officer a day prior. "i have declared a state of emergency & initiated efforts to deploy the nat'l guard & highway patrol to assist local law enforcement in clt," mccrory tweeted late wednesday night. story continued below civil unrest surged tuesday as reports of the fatal shooting of keith lamont scott spread, prompting mass protests that went into the night. a dozen officers were injured during the unrest, according to a tweet from the local police department early wednesday morning. as protests continued wednesday, reports emerged of a shooting that left a protester critically wounded, according to the associated press. charlotte officials at first announced the man was dead but later amended the statement to say he was on life support. the police department has said the shooting was not committed by an officer. "these police officers are showing a tremendous amount of courage and there's obviously a few hundred people who have come to our town center in charlotte, north carolina, which is a great city in and their major goal seems to be destruction and harm and that's wrong and it's unacceptable," mccrory said wednesday night on cnn shortly after making the announcement. "we cannot tolerate violence or tolerate the destruction of property and will not tolerate the attacks towards our police officers occurring right now and i feel very strongly about that right now," mccrory added. "that is not the american way." the north carolina governor added that though the state of emergency did not include a curfew, the possibility of one remained "a very strong option." according to local reports, police officers saw scott getting out of his car while holding a gun. the charlotte-mecklenburg police department said scott posed an imminent danger to officers, and an officer shot the man.      mccrory calls state of emergency in charlotte after unrest      
__label__0 it’s seven weeks before election day, five days before the highly anticipated first debate, and donald trump’s television advertisements have all but vanished. trump’s ads last ran nearly a week ago in four battleground states: florida, north carolina, ohio and pennsylvania. since then, the gop presidential nominee has ceded the airwaves to hillary clinton — and is only poised to launch a limited, less-targeted ad campaign in the days before next week’s debate. story continued below while his campaign announced a new ad on tuesday, it’s only going to run on national cable news stations and during two sunday morning public-affairs shows, according to data from the tracking firm, a company that monitors media buys. and even with that seemingly modest buy — the full extent of which wasn't clear on wednesday night — clinton is still outspending him this week many times over. “it’s unprecedented for a major-party nominee in this century to have such an on-again, off-again tv buy,” said elizabeth wilner, a former tv-network political director who, until last month, monitored political advertising for kantar media/cmag. the strategy has perplexed political media buyers who aren’t affiliated with the campaign. trump’s campaign is underfunded compared to hillary clinton’s — his campaign had only $50 million on hand as of aug. 30, according to documents filed with the federal election commission tuesday night — but trump’s failure to advertise consistently threatens the efficacy of his entire paid media campaign, limited as it is. the political media buyers, including republicans who declined to be named in criticizing the nominee, warned that the effects of television ads are fleeting, and any benefit trump might get from putting his paid advertisements in front of voters can be undone with time if those messages aren’t reinforced. the gop nominee’s absence is also compounding clinton’s domination of the airwaves. last week, smart media group, a media buying firm that works with the republican national committee, wrote in a memo to the trump campaign that through sept. 12, trump had spent just $17 million on tv ads, compared to $126 million for clinton. if outside group spending is counted, the disparity is even more stunning: $244 million for clinton versus $33 million for trump. the highly unusual decision to go mostly dark in advance of the debate is emblematic of trump’s approach to television advertising in the general election, a patchwork effort that has engaged in swing states only in fits and starts. of the 20 days thus far in september, trump has advertised in florida, north carolina and pennsylvania for 11 days, and for 12 in ohio. he’s also run one-week flights in a number of other states beginning over labor day weekend, only to let those expire more than a week ago and decline to rebook. a trump campaign spokesman declined to reply to inquiries on tuesday and wednesday about the campaign’s strategy. clinton, meanwhile, is continuing to blanket eight states in ads. confusion about trump’s strategy runs beyond the scale of his advertising — it’s the unpredictable nature of where and when he is advertising. when trump first launched his tv ads in mid-august, they were focused on four core states: florida, north carolina, ohio and pennsylvania. together, those states will award 82 electoral votes — and trump will win the election if he carries those four and holds all the other states mitt romney won in 2012. trump went on the air in those states on august 19, and he kept advertising in them through september 6 or 7, depending on the state. while those ads were on the air, trump expanded to six new states: colorado, iowa, michigan, nevada, new hampshire and virginia. ads began in those states in early september and ran for roughly one week – including an eye-popping, $2.2-million buy in virginia, where the clinton campaign stopped advertising last month after pulling comfortably ahead in the polls. but the trump ads ended between september 7 and september 10, depending on the state. trump has been off the air in those places ever since. meanwhile, he reengaged in his four core states — florida, north carolina, ohio and pennsylvania — on september 12. (both campaigns abstained from airing ads on the 15th anniversary of the september 11 terrorist attacks.) after nearly a week off the air in those four states most central to his candidacy, trump last monday rolled out a combined $2.5-million ad buy over five days. but those reservations ended last friday. in their place, trump’s campaign is planning a limited ad campaign, buying time on four cable stations: fox business network, fox news channel, msnbc and cnbc. he’s also planning to run national ads during at least two of the national sunday morning public affairs programs on broadcast tv: “fox news sunday” and nbc’s “meet the press.” for political purposes, it’s a relatively inefficient buy. the 11 states that make up politico's battleground states project hold roughly 29 percent of the population. that means, roughly speaking, that seven-in-10 americans reached by a national ad buy live outside the battleground states. the clinton campaign, on the other hand, continues to advertise heavily in eight targeted states: arizona, florida, iowa, north carolina, new hampshire, nevada, ohio and pennsylvania, while also, at times, running national advertisements. (the campaign’s investments in arizona, which has voted republican in 15 of the last 16 presidential elections, are much smaller than in the other states.) just this week — from tuesday through next monday, the day of the first debate — clinton is poised to spend nearly $6.8 million on tv ads, backed up by another $5.6 million from pro-clinton super pac priorities usa action in those states, minus arizona. trump’s air cover from outside groups is also far more limited than clinton’s. rebuilding america now, a pro-trump super pac, is spending $635,000 in pennsylvania this week. and an anti-clinton super pac based in wisconsin, reform america fund, is spending $332,000 in that state, where neither campaign has advertised thus far. there are some signs trump’s campaign may be focusing on its seemingly haphazard ad efforts. gop ad-maker rex elsass met with trump campaign officials last week, politico reported on tuesday. the campaign has already reserved about $2.8 million in satellite tv ads slated to air beginning on tuesday, sept. 27, through the day before election day in eight states: colorado, florida, iowa, nevada, new hampshire, north carolina, ohio and pennsylvania. for trump, there’s risk in continuing to delay: booking ads at the last minute, as trump’s campaign has been doing, sometimes means spending more money for the same spot as a campaign that makes its reservations earlier. and there are some signs that some of the late decision-making is driven by the candidate: the new york times reported earlier this month that trump himself has been selecting the media markets in which the campaign has been advertising. since research suggests the effects of television ads are short-lived — and with the race tightening in the battleground states in recent weeks, trump can ill-afford to regress. “it has to be consistent,” said one gop ad-buyer, “because the recall on these just evaporates when you go dark.” alex isenstadt contributed to this report.      trump's bizarre ad strategy      
__label__1 brad paisley doesn’t seem like one who would call out any other dude, but apparently he is! brad paisley is one of our favorite country artists, and he has more american pride than almost any other country artist. although we were surprised at his latest statement, we kind of weren’t surprised at the same time. if you have any kind of social media, or you read the news anywhere you have probably heard about a man by the name of colin kaepernick. he is the san fransisco 49ers quarterback and he refused to stand up during the national anthem.  of course, this caused a lot of controversy all over the u.s considering the fact that football is america’s sport. kaepernick stated his reasoning behind sitting during the national anthem and it only made american’s more mad…well most of them at least. “i am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color…to me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. there are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”  in response to his comment his team made a statement saying that it is an individuals choice to choose wether they stand for the anthem or not. “the national anthem is and always will be a special part of the pre-game ceremony. it is an opportunity to honor our country and reflect on the great liberties we are afforded as its citizens. in respecting such american principles as freedom of religion and freedom of expression, we recognize the right of an individual to choose and participate, or not, in our celebration of the national anthem.” this didn’t set well with brad paisley though, and he made sure that his fans knew he didn’t support kaepernick’s decisions. the country star was recently performing at then pnc music pavilion in charlotte and a video came up behind him that had fans rolling laughing.  paisley was performing a fan favorite song “celebrity” that talks about stars who let fame get to their heads. it’s a humorous song, but the best part was the video that was playing behind paisley while he sand the song. the video was of making fun of celebrities like kim kardashian, justin bieber, and donald trump. the crowd was laughing hysterically but then a video of a cartoon kaepernick was kneeling on the football field and other players were standing around him! the crowds tone changed quick and they turned their laughs into yelling and booing. paisley didn’t say anything about kaeapernick before showing the video, but apparently he is going to be showing it at all of his concerts!  what do you think about the video idea?      brad paisley has a brutal message for cop-haters, this is spot on

__label__1 there’s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice. one of our most cherished american rights is the right to peacefully assemble — to protest. however, that’s often not what happens when black lives matter activists set out to make a statement. too often, they don’t understand what the words “peaceful protest” mean. that was proved true once again in north carolina last night, when a black lives matter mob descended upon a highway and began attacking people. the rioters began by throwing rocks at cars and trucks, protesting the shooting of a black man on that same highway.  video: this is what we saw overnight; protestors throwing rocks, blocking a major interstate, face-to-face w/@cmpd @twcnewsclt #keithscott pic.twitter.com/bvhubkj4x9 — christina watkins (@cwatkinstv) september 21, 2016   but it quickly became dangerous, when the mob ambushed a female truck driver. she was trapped in the truck as the rioters looted her truck, stealing the goods and lighting them on fire, all while she was inside. she called police, but they never came. instead, a media chopper got footage of the violence.  🤕try & picture collapsing hillary clinton getting out of bed to deal with chaos & violence in n.c #keithlamontscott pic.twitter.com/kavplhmwpb — deplorable trumpcat (@darren32895836) september 21, 2016       it didn’t stop there, though; by the end of the night, 16 police officers were injured and the freeway had been shut down.   message to these black lives matter protesters: this doesn’t help your cause. protesting the killing of a black man at the hands of police is a valid thing to do. shutting down a freeway, throwing rocks at cars, attacking an innocent truck driver and injuring 16 police officers is not. that’s not a protest; it’s a riot. and it doesn’t endear anyone to the black lives matter cause. it makes racial division worse and inflames racial tension. that doesn’t fix anything. martin luther king, jr. encouraged people to use love, hope and integrity to make a difference when he was fighting for civil rights. it’s shameful to see the black lives matter movement literally doing the exact opposite. instead of love, they spread anger and hatred and intolerance. they encourage black people to see themselves as perpetual victims and white people as racist oppressors. how they are able to look at themselves in the mirror without feeling deep shame for their actions is truly beyond comprehension.       chaos! nc protest mob ambushes female truck driver, loots truck, sets cargo on fire – no one helps!?

__label__1 really? hillary clinton is now vowing to take on racism, and she’s starting with our police officers? this woman is an idiot. words nearly fail me on this one…because it is just so ridiculous! the woman, is making all the wrong choices, and desperately trying to win votes. the so-called ‘racism’ issue does not begin with police officers or white people… the woman has gone certifiably … mad. “we gotta tackle the systemic racism, this horrible shooting again, how many times do we have to see this in our country?” she said in an appearance on the steve harvey show. clinton was specifically referring to the police shooting of terence crutcher in tulsa, oklahoma, saying he had his “hands in the air” when he was killed. “this is unbearable and it needs to be intolerable,” she said. clinton told harvey that if the african-american community came out and voted for her, she would work to stop racial shootings by police officers. “maybe i can by speaking directly to white people say, ‘look this is not who we are,’” she said. “we’ve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. actually hillary…what we need to is to stop putting divisive, selfish, wicked people into the white house as president…who creates problems so they can look like a hero when they say stupid crap like this. she wants this chaos, obama wants this chaos. it’s breeding grounds for ‘stupid’ and they want the american people… stupid, so they can continue running the place however they please.      hillary vows to put white people and cops in their place to stop racial police shootings…      
__label__1 freedom is the bedrock that this nation was built upon. the problem is, liberals hate freedom. oh, sure — they pay lip service to its importance, but ultimately, they want people to be subservient to a liberal-controlled government. they may not want a tyrannical king, but a tyrannical government of socialist-loving politicians pushing government-controlled everything is a-ok with them. they can’t ever say this out loud, though. which makes the speech obama just gave to the united nations rather surprising. obama actually admitted that he thinks it’s necessary for the united states to give up a little liberty… you know, for “safety”. tuesday, obama spoke to the united nations general assembly. “we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations, like my own, accept constraints,” he said. “sometimes i am criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. but i am convinced in the long run, giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to the international rules over the long-term enhances our security.”   so evidently, obama believes that we should relinquish more of our freedom and sovereignty so that the international community can rule over us. how this will make the country safer, he didn’t explain. but safety relies on us bringing more muslim refugees into the united states. “ultimately our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees,” obama said. obama may want to take a look at how germany is doing. accepting tons of refugees without screening them first has certainly not made their country safer — it’s made it more dangerous. and right here in the united states, we have had multiple terrorist attacks over the last year.   how allowing over 110,000 muslim refugees with no vetting whatsoever into our country will keep us safe is not something that obama can actually explain, because it’s a completely ludicrous idea. and turning the united states into a country that has to answer to the united nations before we act on anything doesn’t make us safer, either. it’s a typical liberal idea: something that is nonsensical and useless, yet will weaken the country and strip americans of their constitutionally-protected rights. but hey, who needs freedom, right? obama has an agenda to push.       obama to un: ‘giving up liberty, enhances security in america…’ [video]      
__label__1 hillary clinton wants to take your guns. that has been made clear as she has never shied away from shilling for gun control. but the national rifle association isn’t going to let her get away with it without a fight. they’ve already released a good number of brutal ads targeting hillary, but the newest one points out how, if hillary is elected, she will do everything she can to leave you defenseless.   hillary, and her liberal anti-gun followers, will of course try to claim that all they want is “common sense” gun reform. but what hillary wants isn’t just some kind of mild gun reform, like requiring a background check before someone can purchase a gun. she wants things like a 25% tax on guns and refuses to say that she believes that the second amendment is constitutional. she even praised the australian gun buyback program, where australian citizens had their guns confiscated by the government. of course, hillary doesn’t hate all guns. she just doesn’t want americans to be armed. she has armed security guards protecting her every single day, so she doesn’t have to worry about potentially defending herself in a life-or-death situation. she also doesn’t care if you ever need to defend yourself. she’s safe and that’s all that matters. she wants to force you to rely on the government for protection.   that’s why the nra’s new ad works. people don’t want to be defenseless. police officers are fantastic and they risk their lives every day to protect americans… but they can’t be everywhere at once. if someone is in danger, it will take police a few minutes to get there. and without guns, there is literally nothing they can do to defend themselves. hillary’s plan actually does leave americans defenseless. worst of all, gun control doesn’t work. look at chicago, with their super strict gun control laws. they still have some of the highest gun violence numbers in the country. australia still has problems with gun violence, particularly with gangs and drug dealers, despite forcibly confiscating people’s guns. gun control doesn’t work. and that’s why liberals like hillary have to lie and use fear to force their agenda into action. the only question is, will americans fall for it?       nra unleashes chilling ad: ‘don’t let hillary leave you defenseless” [video]      
__label__1 just like barack obama and many people in his orbit, hillary clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. there are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. they shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there. the daily caller news foundation has been trying to get documents from the state department forever concerning clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. it’s called deniable plausibility. the daily caller news foundation filed a foia lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. will they see them before the election? a judge has ordered it… i wouldn’t hold my breath.  from the daily caller: a frustrated federal judge ordered the state department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former secretary of state hillary clinton and her top aides. judge richard leon ruled tuesday in favor of the daily caller news foundation by rejecting the state department’s motion to dismiss thedcnf’s freedom of information act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the freedom of information act. but he also denied thedcnf’s request to depose state department officials. the state department has been unable to produce any records confirming that clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. in addition to clinton, thedcnf seeks the same records for former clinton chief of staff cheryl mills, deputy chief of staff huma abedin and advisor jacob sullivan. huma abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. but these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, i don’t look for them to do so this time. and for some reason they are never held to account for it. the rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’. judge richard leon is getting fed up with state department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. he ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by sept. 26th and the rest of them by oct. 10th. bradley moss, one of the attorneys representing thedcnf, said “judge leon’s order made clear his frustration with the state department’s continued obstruction of the foia process. state will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” i hope they carry through with those consequences this time. it’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. the word for this is ‘corruption’. state department officials admitted in a july 29th response to thedcnf that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by clinton or her aides. well, duh. that’s for peons, not the elite evidently.        breaking: judge demands release of clinton’s security training files – she has 5 days…

(he was also charged in that incident with assault on a police officer and resisting, but that was dismissed.) 2011 public intoxication (while in prison for drug trafficking) — conviction 2012 public intoxication — conviction obstructing an officer — conviction 2013 dui — conviction resisting officer — conviction open container — conviction failure to wear seatbelt — conviction speeding — conviction but even all of that was not all. take a look at the numerous open warrants for crutcher. these aug. 30 warrants were active at the time of his death, and as you can see in the graphic below, they included things like dui, resisting, drug trafficking and public intoxication.  the media are actively pushing the narrative that crutcher had his hands up and that the police shot him anyway. we’ve heard this lie peddled by the media before, in the michael brown case, and clearly the obtuse media didn’t learn a thing. helicopter video footage of crutcher’s altercation with police has surfaced. take a look:  now, you watch that video and listen to the commentary. did it look to you like crutcher was following commands? you can hear an officer say that crutcher was “still walking” and that he wasn’t “following commands.” another officer said that he “could be on something.” take a look at these pictures bearing arms grabbed from the video that disprove the media’s false narrative:       as you can see, crutcher was not shot with his hands up. he was clearly flouting officer orders, and at the time of his shooting he lowered his right hand toward his waistband. oh, and by the way, the media have run with the story that crutcher was unarmed, but didn’t seem too interested in the pcp that was found in his car and that the tulsa police department officer who shot crutcher, betty shelby, was trained to spot pcp abuse, according to bearing arms. in any of these cases, the legal system should be given time to do its job, but the media have decided to run false narratives that fit their agenda without all the facts and, in some cases, despite the facts. as you can see above, there’s clearly more to the story. please share this on facebook and twitter if you agree that the mainstream media use cases like this to bolster their divisive and dangerous agenda against law enforcement. what's your take on the crutcher case and the mainstream media's attempt to push a false narrative? scroll down to comment below!      breaking: truth about terence crutcher comes out… it’s bad for the media      
__label__1 one of former president bill clinton’s oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with democrat presidential nominee hillary clinton, and if she’s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state. dolly kyle, author of “hillary the other woman,” said clinton has been “’cruisin’ for a bruisin’,” because she’s so angry and driven by rage. “people like that eventually break down, physically.” “hillary clinton is not physically fit to be president,” kyle told wnd. “anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. if she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. but she is losing her mental capabilities, she’s suffering from real cognitive impairment.” kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks. these symptoms coupled with clinton’s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster. “that paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” kyle said, and it’s simply not a good combination for anyone — much less the president of the united states. kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about hillary clinton — and clinton’s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture. clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants — even if it means jeopardizing her health and the democrat party, according to kyle. “she has been running for president ever since she took hold of billy clinton’s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,” the lawyer said. this was more bad news for clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country. share this story and let us know what you think about dolly kyle’s claim that hillary clinton is losing her mental capacities. what do you think about clinton's fitness for office? scroll down to comment below!      decades-old clinton friend comes forward, says she knows what’s happening to hillary      
__label__1 next week’s debate may be the nation’s most widely watched presidential debate in years. that is, if both participants actually bother to show up.  trump-enthusiast and gateway pundit owner jim hoft published an article today in which he says that an unnamed “conservative leader” contacted him stating that hillary may be pulling out of monday’s debate. now this… a conservative leader wrote the gateway pundit wednesday morning to share this news: hearing smart guys say that hillary may cancel the debate on monday … hillary may be trying to run out the clock because she thinks she is ahead. could it be that hillary clinton pulls out of the debate, or is this just propaganda for trump? or even, a way to garner more interest for the much-awaited debate between the republican and democratic presidential candidates donald trump and hillary clinton? with the widely-publicized health problems facing the democratic nominee, it may very well be that she faces a “medical emergency” just before she is slated to take the stage. what do you think is the legitimacy of these whisperings?       this just in: hillary may be cancelling monday’s debate…      
__label__1 there has been a lot of speculation and anger surrounding the shooting of a black man by charlotte police. such anger, in fact, has bred more riots in north carolina, which led to looting, theft of private property and the shutdown of i-85.  but all we’re being told is the side of things where the man was an innocent little cupcake on his way to volunteer at a soup kitchen before he read stories to blind, homeless children and donated all of his paycheck to the local animal shelter. what is the story coming from the police officers involved in the shooting? does anyone care? does it even matter what the cops say happened? the riots have already started and the hatred is already coursing through the veins of people who are just looking for a reason to take to the streets, so will this change anything? to those of us who actually uses our brains in these situations, it could make all the difference. the blaze posted the statement of the charlotte-mecklenburg police chief on the incident. charlotte-mecklenburg police chief kerr putney said during a news conference wednesday morning that officers were searching for a suspect tuesday when they saw 43-year-old keith lamont scott exit a vehicle with a handgun. he says the officers told him to drop the gun and that he got out of the vehicle a second time still carrying the gun. he says the man was shot because he posed a threat. “it’s time to change the narrative, because i can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,” he said. as an officer, you’re hearing about your brothers and sisters in blue being shot by thugs who have a chip on their shoulder. you hear this and then you see a man get out of his vehicle with a firearm. you tell him to put the gun down, and he refuses. are you supposed to wait until he shoots first? if a man breaks into your house, are you supposed to wait until he actually harms you before you protect yourself? how does that even make sense? oh that’s right, it doesn’t. of course, that doesn’t stop progressives from declaring that they know exactly how things should be happening. you know, with their degrees in women’s studies and art history, they’re clearly the most qualified people to be criticizing the actions of our law enforcement.       charlotte police reveal what they said to black man just moments before shooting…

__label__1 i’m looking for silver linings this morning, after waking up to news that rioters trashed charlotte, north carolina because they didn’t get the facts right. and i think i might have found one… in typical “don’t waste a crisis” democrat fashion, queen hillary tweeted this out about the police shootings in charlotte and tulsa, ok. because who cares about facts when there are political points to be scored! keith lamont scott. terence crutcher. too many others. this has got to end. -h — hillary clinton (@hillaryclinton) september 21, 2016  i’m willing to bet that hillz wouldn’t give a crap about keith scott or terence crutcher if they hadn’t been black men killed by police officers. but that’s just me. enter chris christie, who definitely knows a political opportunist when he sees one. he pretty much dropped the bomb on hillary’s racist assumption when calling in to laura ingraham’s radio show. and it is glorious – christie responds to hillary citing systemic racism: “she is a disgrace. its typical hrc. she knows nothing but the mouth never stops.” — angelo carusone (@goangelo) september 21, 2016  .@govchristie:’@hillaryclinton has no experience in law-enforcement except being interviewed by them; she’s a disgrace’ — laura ingraham (@ingrahamangle) september 21, 2016  ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha oh man – even if he’s not running for president, christie still knows how to call out hillary’s progressive bs. it’s a beautiful thing.

__label__1 the use of chemical weapons is banned throughout most civilized countries. however, the savages that comprise isis have certainly never been accused of being civilized… early reports indicate that isis has used chemical weapons on u.s. troops in iraq.   several u.s. officials have claimed that isis fired a shell filled with mustard gas into qayyara air base in iraq on tuesday where u.s. and iraqi troops are stationed. the shell was either a rocket or an artillery shell and was promptly tested and revealed to contain a chemical agent that reports indicate was mustard gas. no troops were injured in the attack and no troops have yet showed any signs or symptoms of the effects of mustard gas. according to one official, the weapon was poorly weaponized and the chemical was of “low purity.” u.s. officials have anticipated an attack of this nature as several hundred u.s. troops remain stationed just outside of mosul to assist iraqi forces in taking-back mosul from isis. pentagon officials have maintained that u.s. airstrikes have been hitting locations where it is believed that isis is manufacturing chemicals like mustard gas. however, mustard gas is fairly easy to produce and while our airstrikes have been effective, it is unlikely that our efforts will cease production of such weapons. while president obama and his band of weakling followers cannot be blamed for each vile act conducted by isis, they can be blamed for not taking seriously enough the resolve of the terrorist groups fighting to the death to kill so-called infidels. though president obama seems pleased with his oh-so-gentle brand of targeted airstrikes, our military engagement in the middle east does little but inconvenience isis as they march onward towards more death and destruction. while obama applies the least amount of military pressure possible, isis is experimenting with chemical weapons. who seems to be taking this fight more seriously?       just in: isis hits u.s. troops with chemical weapons…      
__label__1 our constitution protects the right of people to disrespect this nation. it’s despicable, but such policies help preserve the very foundation of freedom in america.   however, nowhere in the constitution does it say that every action and speech is protected against consequences. though one may not be jailed for speaking, that doesn’t mean that employers cannot dictate what speech is acceptable in the workplace. as such, one history teacher who disrespected america has discovered that while his actions did not land him in jail, he has landed in hot water. a teacher on monday at massey hill classical high school in fayetteville, north carolina – home of fort bragg and america’s special forces – stomped on the flag to prove a point about the value of the first amendment. because of this, the teacher has been placed on administrative leave while the school district investigates the incident. students reported that the teacher had attempted to burn and tear the flag before stomping on it. several students were upset and some walked out in protest of the disgrace. “i put it on the ground and i used my right foot and i took two steps on it, and immediately two kids get out of the room,” the teacher, lee francis, stated. francis was teaching about the first amendment and specifically about texas v. johnson, a supreme court case that struck-down prohibitions on flag desecration. “but this is exactly what i teach: you don’t teach kids how to think or what to think; you teach them to go their own path,” francis said. “if they feel so convicted that this is their cause they’re going to stand for, i don’t blame them. it’s an upper-level school for those who aspire to go to college and in that regard, we have rigor and expectations, so i treat them as such.” “not only was the demonstration warranted and justified based on the court, it’s warranted and justified in the rights we have,” he continued. this is the law of the land upheld by the highest court. freedom of speech is not just defined verbally by something you say or write down on paper, but something that can also be a physical action.” the school district has placed him on paid administrative leave as they investigate. what francis’ explanation reveals, however, is that he remains ignorant about the world he lives in. just because something is legal does not mean that it is a good idea and it doesn’t mean that the legal act is not deeply offensive to some or downright inappropriate. if francis wished to teach about texas v. johnson, he should have done so the way countless other teachers have done: by explaining it. acting-out the provocative action is not necessary and unnecessarily hurtful to members of the fiercely-patriotic fayetteville community. unfortunately, “paid administrative leave” sounds an awful like “union-sponsored paid vacation.”       ‘this is how i teach freedom of speech’ flag stomping teacher meets instant justice!      
__label__1 (via jewsnews) quebec mayor gives muslim ârefugeesâ a little piece of his mind by spilling the truth that canadians donât adapt to them, itâs the other way around.  â muslims must understand that they must adapt to canada, its customs, its traditions, its way of life, because it was the country that was chosen to emigrate. you have to understand that they are the ones that they must integrate and learn to live in canada. need to understand that they have to be for them to change their lifestyle, not the canadians who so generously welcomed them. you must understand that canadians are not racist or xenophobic. we accept many immigrants, in many countries with different cultures and religions, contradicting to many muslim countries which do not accept immigrants non-muslims. for this reason, the canadians are not willing to give up their identity and their culture. finally, they have to understand that in canada, with its judeo-christian roots, christmas trees, churches and religious festivals, religion must remain in the private sphere. the municipality of durval has the right to refuse any concessions to islam and sharia law. for muslims, who are not in agreement with the canadian culture and religion and do not feel comfortable in canada, there are 57 beautiful muslim countries in the world, most of them under-populated and ready to receive them with open arms, in accordance with sharia law. if you left his country to come to canada, and not to a muslim country, it is because you have considered that life is better in canada than in other places. help yourself to the question, just once: why is it better here in canada that where it comes from. it boggles my mind that many feel that they have the right or the authority to control other peoples lives. this is the direct opposite of what we feel as humans. because muslims cannot eat a particular meal, should mean they should bring their own. the few should never out weigh the many, especially when it comes to adopted culture. adopt it, or don’t. just do block others from it. gernot trolf mar 28, 2016 at 1:12 pm the prime minister of australia said much the same and i agree with you both wholeheartedly. spread the word. adapt or leave      mayor tells muslim refugees: âwe donât adapt to your culture, you adapt to oursâ      
__label__1 chapter ii from my book the trump revolution (available at amazon) read chapter i here. the dishonorable businessmen! the elite! before i start whipping the corrupt, dishonorable business men, i want to note two points: the first point, this book is written from the point of view of a capitalist who believes in honorable businessmen who, in turn, are responsible for building the country, and employing its people. with the “country,” i mean america, not china or mexico. the second point, i can hear someone saying trump is a businessman and he is from the elite. let me say something. when you play a sport and you want to be successful you follow the rules that are set for the game, even if you don’t like them. however, if you head the federation of that sport, you would have a chance to change the rules that you do not believe in. now we are ready for the whipping. the elite of this country, a group of very rich businessmen. they own almost everything including the media and the politicians. you can even call them the neo-lords. let’s tell an old story that we all know to see where the neo-lords emerged from. america is the land of the free. the peasants fled europe from the oppression of their lords, the hunger, the illness, etc. they fled to america to live as free farmers, until the neo-lords grew again in the land of the free. at the old time, the lord was the owner and the ruler. now, the neo-lords, who are the elite businessmen, are the owners and they own the rulers, the politicians shall we say. they even went further, and decided to own the minds and hearts of the people, so they decided to own the media and they even penetrated the churches. the lord-peasant system found its way again to the land of the free. the system developed. after a struggle, the american people adapted to the new system and forced their elite businessmen to adapt to the idea that they are dealing with free people. the elite businessmen uncomfortable with the idea that the american people are not peasants enough, they decided to leave to where they can find real peasants. they got their bought-off politicians to sign a couple of regional and international free trade agreements. the factories moved to china, mexico and other countries as a consequence. apparently, the elite-businessmen found that their multi-billion dollars are not big enough fortune, so they moved to china to make an extra couple of billions of dollars on cheap labor. probably, they were afraid that their children might starve and they need an extra couple of billions to make sure they are full. in the transition, they are using america as a market, a dwindling market. it shrinks as more and more factories are closing and moving abroad. consequently, more and more workers are laid off. and so, less shoppers and buyers. an economy cannot be sustained by the people selling services to each other and producing nothing. the elite-businessmen are milking the cows to the last drop and slaughtering them one after one. quite like the lords in the earlier history, when they are fed-up with a town and the people are harder to rule; they pillage it, burn it and move to another town to start again. that is what the corrupt elite of the united states’ businessmen are doing. they use their politicians and their media to get the job done. the corruption prevailed, but the free americans figured out that there is something wrong and they started to revolt. they did not know where to start and what to do, so donald trump jumped in and decided to lead them. stand up america, the leader is here. so how should an honorable businessman be? the businessman is a career. like any career, it has its duties and its ethics. so what are the duties? the businessman’s job is building the elements of the economy of the country using his special abilities; like his skills, knowledge, personal character etc. he has to take part in building the country. he has to be involved in forming and executing plans to develop the country. before and after these, he is responsible for employing the people of his country and getting the best out of them. to accomplish that, he has to socially secure the lives of the workers to make them feel that the time and effort are worth giving. for the businessman to achieve this goal, he has to watch for the health of his workers, physical, mental and psychological. what i mentioned are not newly innovated ideas. many companies are famous for their “good benefits and pay.” that’s what a businessman is supposed to do. what are our elite-businessmen doing? they are shutting factories’ doors, they lay off workers and they move the factories to other countries. then, they force the people of the united states to buy the products of the factories they moved to the other countries!!! i hate to be sarcastic, but “what a patriotic and responsible action.” i can hear them murmuring: “hmm…….   the workers have to help themselves, to stand for themselves hmm…..” congratulations for increasing your profits greedy blood suckers. imagine that all the american medical doctors decided to close the hospitals and to move them to another countries. so, to make more money, they leave the american patients to stand for themselves. imagine if a man decided to abandon his family for a rich woman leaving his wife and children to stand for themselves. what are the nationalities of these gluttonous misers? could they have closed the factories without buying the politicians? the answer is no. could they have done this without a cover-up from their media? the answer is no. selfishness, greed. i would say treason. the elite-businessmen formed an alliance against donald trump, why? he is the only politician who stood up and spoke out about getting the factories back to america. don’t believe those who started to hijack his ideas after almost a year of campaigning, they found themselves loosing. they will not touch this subject when they get the presidency. they are just elite-businessmen’s pawns. if they believe in getting the factories back, they would not have waited that long to mention it during their campaigns. they just found themselves loosing. the elite-businessmen’s media here we are talking about all of what is called the mainstream media. most all the news channels owned by the elite-businessmen. trump should be proud they are all against him. have you ever seen any other candidate being grilled by them like they grill trump? they pressure trump as hard as they can then they catch any of his tongue-slips. they make stories and they keep wailing and screaming about these tongue-slips non-stop!!! what should the job of the media be? showing the people the truth about what is happening. displaying the real problems facing the people according to the people’s priorities. explaining what is being plotted against them. that is what they are supposed to do. but, what are they really doing? tranquilizing the people by dragging their attention to anything other than their real life problems. entertaining the people and making them laugh and enjoy their life while the country is being set on fire. wake up america!!! have you ever seen cnn and her sister channels going with their cameras to show the closed, abandoned factories? have you ever seen them roaming with their cameras in the streets of abandoned ghost towns? did they interview laid off workers or the abused walmart workers who are even being replaced by machines. have they shown all of that on their screens? but you know what? we are on the move, and we found a father, a leader who is listening to us, and speaks and acts on our behalf. stand up america, the leader is here. the elite-businessmen’s politicians welcome to the employees of the elite-businessmen. they call them senators, representatives and even presidents. they belong to two owned companies that are called political parties: republicans and democrats. most of these politicians in the last 50 years are bought and sold. they are playing a game they call an election. the rule of the game; let the people get indulged in ideological battles, conservatives against liberals but make sure they don’t break free from the exploitation of the elite-businessmen. it does not matter who wins, the factories were sent and being sent abroad by republican presidents, democratic presidents, republican congress, democratic congress etc. were the people asked to approve or disapprove the free trade agreements? i mean were these agreements among the issues the candidates were talking about in their election campaigns before they signed them? the people are only allowed to make the country 5% more conservative or 5% more liberal. it looks like trump is taking it far away, beyond what the people are allowed to change. let me recite a scenario that would show how a catastrophic decision would be taken behind the people’s backs: the elite-businessmen speaking to a to-be-president: you look like you can make a good president… you are smart or else we wouldn’t have approached you… we will make you president in return for a favor……. we want you to do so and so…. if you don’t follow, we will destroy you….no second term…..and/ or big scandal…. you get us angry and you are a dead dog…. end of the scenario. it is literally a deal with the devil. they ask the politician for a catastrophic decision that feeds their greed and harm the people. listen greedy-hearts, no more of these dirty tricks. stand up, america. donald j. trump is here.  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      who owns the politicians and the media?

__label__1 lack of a border wall has allowed illegal drugs to decimate american society. further, drugs have enriched foreigners beyond imagination. el chapo was so wealthy, he had a private zoo. he was said to import animals from all over the world for his viewing pleasure. an empire built by drug money. foreigners involved in drugs make billions of dollars, and impact governments with their corruption. it’s time america fight back, and trump has a novel approach. in trump’s recent immigration speech, he assured america that  mexico would pay for his proposed border wall “100 percent.” the mexican cartels may be how trump plans to pay for the wall. according to lifezette, a senior trump campaign official, a president trump would consider using assets seized from mexican drug cartels to finance the construction. you have to admire this type of thinking; using funds seized from the illegal drug trade to stop the illegal border activities. a wall is not the only solution, but consider what the wall does. trumps wall would cost around $8-10 billion dollars, money that could spur the economy. next, the wall would lessen the flow of illegals into america. the objective of the wall is to force people to use our legal immigration system. the plan reportedly would involve “joint border security fund,” in which seized assets from both sides of the border would be deposited and used to build and maintain the border wall “to the benefit of both mexico and the united states.” the funding? the justice department seized $8.7 billion in drug money in 2015 alone, according to an audit. there’s no telling how much we’ve accumulated. further, that figure doesn’t include assets seized by the mexican government. the wall represents an attack on the drug cartels. these groups menace mexico, and their crimes undoubtedly affect people in the united states. the wall begins the fight against corruption, drugs, human trafficking, illegal immigration, and terrorism in one fell swoop. “for decades, the illicit drug and arms trade has endangered and destroyed the lives of countless mexicans and americans,” an anonymous trump immigration adviser said. “it would be sweet justice to use their illegal profits and property for something good.” trump thinks differently than washington. his type of thinking is what america needs. h/t newsmax       trump’s novel way mexico will pay for the border wall      
__label__1 who won the debate tonight? donald j. trump or the lester holt-clinton team? nbc news’ lester holt had his “candy crowley” moment at the first debate of the 2016 presidential election on monday night, bowing to pressure from the hillary clinton campaign and the liberal media by “fact-checking” republican nominee donald trump on the question of his support for the iraq war. holt lived up to the expectations of his peers. but he lived down to the worst expectations of conservatives, who routinely see republican candidates treated unfairly by debate moderators. hillary also went over the 2 minute mark several times, while there were several times when lester holt would cut donald trump off after only having a little over a minute to answer a question.  again and again, holt asked trump tough questions that were straight from the clinton campaign’s talking points, and which were obvious set-ups for clinton to attack (and for fact-checkers to pounce on whatever trump asserted in his own defense). here are the five worst examples. tax returns. holt never asked clinton about her e-mail scandal, about benghazi, or about the clinton foundation and its dubious dealings. but he did ask trump about his tax returns, arguing — not asking — that there might be questionable information in them that the american public deserved to hear. birther conspiracy theory. holt never asked clinton about her past record of racist statements, including her “super-predator” remarks as first lady, or her explicit appeal to “white americans” in her 2008 primary campaign against obama. yet he asked trump about the birther conspiracy theory and cast it as racist. stop-and-frisk. after an exchange between the candidates over the policy of “stop-and-frisk,” holt interjected to bolster clinton’s point by stating, erroneously, that stop-and-frisk had ended in new york because it had been declared unconstitutional by a court. trump countered, correctly, that the new mayor had canceled the policy before the litigation was over.  “a presidential look.” towards the end of the debate, holt asked trump about what he meant by saying hillary clinton did not have “a presidential look.” he did so after noting that clinton had become “the first woman” to be nominated for president by a major political party, thus setting trump up as a sexist. as trump answered, holt interrupted him, then gave clinton a chance to respond with her talking points about trump’s past comments on women. iraq war. the question of whether trump supported the iraq war or not has been widely debated. what is beyond doubt is that hillary clinton voted for it. holt only represented one side of the debate about trump, and never asked clinton about her own vote. via: breitbart       lester holt pulls a “candy crowley” 5 times…joins team hillary to help debate trump      
__label__1 i don’t know what it’s like to be dumb. i have been a thinking individual my entire life. so being able to relate to 18-yr-old zannay laws and dakei perry and why they filmed themselves beating up and robbing an old man to post on social media will be a challenge. based on their actions i can only say they were probably both dropped on their heads at birth and since then joined the black lives matter movement. they seem to share the same mentality. a 64-year-old man was reading a book at 5 p.m. in the north baltimore park near the johns hopkins university, little did he know that he was about to get the shock of his life. a group of young thugs found him and decided to rob him, but not in the normal robber way of “give me all your money”, they wanted to have some ‘fun’ with it. these millennials decided to film the whole thing for ‘prosperity’ or something (doubt they know the definition of the word). the first suspect held a gun to his head demanding his stuff like cellphone and money. the second stabbed the poor old man in his lower back. even thought the man was incapacitated and had a gun on him, the third decided to spray mace in his face. someone stabbed him again, this time in the right arm and the suspects took his iphone, backpack and $60. all this while live streaming on facebook. wow… brilliant folks we got here. they filmed their entire crime and put it out there for people to see, did they not know they created the best evidence to land themselves in jail? serious asshats! police spokesman t.j. smith said, “criminals do some crazy things. they record themselves committing crimes, and we thank them for it. we encourage the criminals to continue to record your acts, and encourage citizens to continue to send us information when you find the criminal wrongdoing on camera and on social media.” smith said detectives were working to confirm the identities of the other two suspects, but said they believe the group has committed a series of crimes in the area. smith called it a “little crime spree.” this group is suspected of other similar type crimes in the neighborhood and one in custody has already started singing. would you at any age or stage in your life think stabbing and mace-ing an old man was fun? i’m just curious if this is only a black lives matter thing.       dumbass thugs post video on facebook of them violently robbing old man      
__label__1 charlotte thug rioters gang jumped a man in a parking garage for a really good reason – the guy was white! why else would a bunch of black people beat up a random white guy? the fact that the white guy was in a parking garage meant either he lived there or was visiting someone. or, he works there. that being said, he probably has a job. work is something the black lives matter thugs don’t like to participate in. they’d rather sit around being bums all day, then beating people at night every time a cop shoots a criminal. the white guy in this video has nothing to do with the shooting of that keith lamont scott fella or any other black person shot by a cop. it doesn’t even matter if a black cop shoots a black thug – the losers still use it as an excuse to steal, beat people, and destroy a neighborhood. this is sadly what people are now calling the “black mentality” or the “thug mentality” and it’s extremely sad because that is not how things should be. hannity – although numerous individual acts of assault, looting, and violence have been reported, one horrible incident seems to capture the chaos that enveloped charlotte on wednesday evening. in a video making the rounds on social media, an unidentified man is beaten and dragged along the ground as he begs his assailants for mercy. the beating is said to have taken place in the garage of the epicenter, a shopping mall in downtown charlotte this is not what being an american is all about. this is not what being black or white is about either. there’s so many better black american’s who deserve recognition for the good things they do, but every time riots like this happen, those good people get blurred out by the bad black americans. i think it’s time for the good people of the african american community to shape up or ship out the loser thugs. #charlotteprotest beating man begging for mercy in parking garage. @ac360 @seanhannity @bretbaier credit:lenard bennett (facebook) @ncnaacp pic.twitter.com/ywheu2uv1n — libertarian queen (@libertarianqn) september 22, 2016  start reprimanding the thugs on their senseless behavior. people like the thugs in this video make the rest of a culture look bad. stand up to them and don’t let them hold your culture and skin color hostage. there are too many good black people in this world to let some thuggish losers make the rest of them look bad. when the good black people of america stand up and reprimand the bad ones, then you’ll see a real change. good people thrive while thugs like this will always be losers. don’t let the losers hold you down.       watch: charlotte rioters beat white man as he begs for mercy

__label__1 an independent examiner has determined that tyre king, the 13 year-old african-american boy fatally shot by columbus, oh police last wednesday, was “more likely than not” running away from an officer at the time he was shot. the conclusion would seem to contradict the official police narrative, which holds that king was shot in a confrontation with officers after “he pulled a realistic-looking bb gun on them”. king was shot at 7:42 pm last wednesday after officers responded to reports of an armed robbery over $10 by a group of three african-american teenagers. according to the official police department report, “officers followed the males to an alley and attempted to take them into custody when one suspect pulled a gun from his waistband. one officer shot and struck the suspect multiple times.” the columbus coroner’s office has completed an autopsy of king’s body but the results won’t be made public for at least six weeks. it was this delay that prompted king’s family to hire an independent medical examiner, dr. francisco diaz, who is a professor of pathology at the university of michigan and works as a medical examiner for wayne county, mi. in a statement released by the king family’s attorney today, diaz said that “based on the location and the direction of the wound paths it is more likely than not that tyre king was in the process of running away from the shooter or shooters when he suffered all three gunshot wounds.” it is not in question that king was involved in the robbery; indeed his friend demetrius braxton, 19, who was with king that night and has since been arrested, said that king “wanted to rob somebody for money.” diaz’s report, however, confirms the suspicions of many in the community and across the country that the use of lethal force by responding officers was unnecessary and that a story of king aiming his gun at the police had been concocted as a justification. indeed braxton’s account of the encounter, given before the results of diaz’s investigation were reported, similarly contradicts the official narrative. he told the local newspaper that “the cops said ‘get down’ and we got down, but my friend [king] got up and ran … [and] when he ran, the cop shot him.” the last time we checked, petty thievery does not carry the death sentence in the united states of america. while many will be inclined to somehow argue that the boy deserves it for committing a robbery, consider this. when young white men are convicted of rape in america, like brock turner, judges let them walk because they think they deserve a second chance. when young african-americans commit crimes, they are smeared as career criminals and executed on the spot. the king case is only the most recent in a long string of deadly encounters between young african-american men and the police, many of which have been muddled by the victims’ having been carrying bb guns made to look like authentic firearms. given the ubiquity not only of bb guns but of actual firearms as well amongst white americans the implication – and sometimes overt justification – by police that the mere presence of what looks like a weapon on a young african-american boy constitutes a deadly threat is questionable at best. the injustice of such encounters becomes even clearer when the victim has his back to the police, a situation in which lethal force should never be the answer. and what is most insidious about these cases is the apparently reflexive instinct of the police to lie, as they seem to have done in king’s case by claiming that he was pointing his weapon at officers when he was shot. far more than the peaceful protests of black lives matter, it is these fabricated standoffs between police and black youth that fuel the fiction of the “war on police.” through their attorney, king’s family have asked that the public “continue to withhold final judgement until all the facts are known and vetted.” they have also called for an independent investigation into their son’s killing, saying that “the columbus police department, the city of columbus and most importantly tyre king and his family deserve the benefit of an investigation from a law enforcement agency that has no direct impact from the outcome of that investigation.”      just in: autopsy finds black child killed by cops shot in the back three times      
__label__1 donald trump’s charity non-profit trump foundation does not exist for its stated purpose of helping those in need, unless one believes trump himself is among the needy. yes, trump was so desperately in need he used the trump foundation’s funds to purchase himself a lunch with a hollywood actress. in 2008, trump was a guest at a gucci charity auction where he had an opportunity to bid on something he found too irresistible to pass up: a trip to france which included lunch with salma hayek which would take place in the husband of hayek billionaire françois-henri pinault’s vineyard. comedian chris rock was hosting the auction and said the auction included “salma hayek and her breasts“, which was like blood in the water for trump. he feverishly bid on the potential meeting all the way up to the tune of $120,000 of the trump foundation’s money. surely a ritzy meal in a billionaire’s vineyard was the best way for trump to help the needy. trump bidding on the auction trip with the foundation’s money very likely violated a non-profit law which prohibits “self-dealing” as 501c3 organizations are required to disclose any use of money to purchase gifts for an organization’s executives. trump’s campaign says he did not personally take the trip, but could also not offer an elaboration as to who did actually take the trip to france. even if trump had given the trip to a family member, he would still be in violation. for her part hayek, while a guest on “jimmy kimmel live” on march 30, 2016, said she and trump have known each other for many years but did not state when they first met. she went on to call trump’s politics “madness” and wondered why so many individuals are supporting him.  in later media appearances, hayak was not nearly as charitable about donald trump. while a guest on “the late late show with james corden” on august 4, 2016 hayak said of trump, “we have a first-grade boy running for president of the united states.”  hayek has not been quiet about trump ‘s hateful rhetoric but she gave him points for showing the world racism still exists. while being interviewed on “america with jorge ramos” on august 6, 2016 hayak said, “the good thing about what trump did is that it’s shown a light to the level of the problem of racism.”  it is safe to say that during their years of knowing one another hayek has had enough of trump’s sub-human personality, and if the two were to meet and converse in the future it would be a terse conversation.      trump stole $120,000 from his charity to pay for fancy dinner with salma hayek

__label__0 lawmakers rolled into the capitol earlier this month bracing for one last round of fireworks before sprinting out of town until after the election. but as congress prepares to wrap up as early as this week leaving the capitol dark until november, lawmakers are exiting more with a whimper than a bang. story continued below the reason? everybody’s got election day on the brain. “i’m glad there wasn’t [drama],” sen. john thune (r-s.d.) said in an interview. “i think right now everybody is focused on nov. 8 and any consequential legislative action probably doesn’t take place until after that.” that warning of a government shutdown harry reid delivered heading into the session? not happening. “i think the senate probably [finishes] by the middle of the week and us maybe by the end, maybe spill over into the week after,” said a relaxed rep. tom cole (r-okla.), a senior member on the house appropriations committee, when asked to predict how they wrap up. the senate has teed up a key procedural vote monday on a stopgap bill to fund government agencies until mid-december, after staffers worked over the weekend to put the finishing touches on a proposal that would satisfy both sides. most of the wrangling — over planned parenthood language related to zika funding, disaster relief for flooded louisiana and internet domain oversight — has unfolded behind the scenes. the senate has taken the lead, a move some considered necessary after house conservatives threatened to withhold support for a bill that didn’t go into next year. “i’d rather it start [the process in the house], but i think the speaker had enough of a challenge to go from six months to three months and considers that, i think, his contribution to the cause,” said house minority leader nancy pelosi (d-calif.). “when you’re writing a bill in one house, then that house dominates the framework.” the funding détente is considered a loss for house gop hard-liners, who were initially pushing for a bill that funded government agencies into early next year, which would have forced a new congress to relitigate the issue with a new president. but even house conservatives seem resigned to a continuing resolution (cr) that ends in december, even if they don’t like it. “for people who think that a short-term cr is better than a long-term cr, it just doesn’t make much sense to me,” said rep. bill flores (r-texas), chairman of the conservative republican study committee. but, “because senate republicans have caved, really the only likely path forward is a short-term cr,” he added. one unrelated issue could still produce some 11th-hour drama. rep. tim huelskamp (r-kansas) has threatened to force a vote to impeach the irs commissioner this week, even after house freedom caucus chairman jim jordan (r-ohio) and house judiciary chairman bob goodlatte (r-va.) reached a last-minute deal to postpone the vote until after the election. under the terms of the handshake agreement, irs commissioner john koskinen will testify before the judiciary committee wednesday under oath, giving jordan and other freedom caucus members the hearing they’d been demanding for months. still, koskinen’s lawyers sent a letter to goodlatte friday warning that the hearing wasn’t an official impeachment proceeding and shouldn’t be treated as such. “testimony under oath from a single witness — before he has even been allowed to see any evidence against him and with no right to present corroborating evidence to address false or mistaken allegations — is no substitute,” koskinen’s lawyers wrote. it remains to be seen what huelskamp will do. his spokesman jon meadows did not return multiple requests from politico seeking clarification on the congressman’s plans. the house freedom caucus hasn’t voted to officially support the deal to push a floor vote on koskinen until after the election, but insiders expect the group’s members to get behind it. that has republicans on the other side of the capitol breathing a sigh of relief. “i know there are a lot of people who feel passionately over [in the house] about that vote but i’m not sure, at this point, what that accomplishes,” thune said. “i just think that was some drama that probably wasn’t necessary right now.”      congress eyes the exit doors

__label__0 senate republicans are moving to aid missouri gop sen. roy blunt, placing their first ad reservations and preparing for a seven-figure ad buy, according to a republican source familiar with the plans. the national republican senatorial committee placed its first, $270,000 ad buy supporting blunt in st. louis, the source said, but more ads are on the way. the ad buy comes just days after independent polling for the first time showed democratic secretary of state jason kander leading blunt. senate democrats are increasingly shift their sights to missouri, where they believe blunt's long time in congress makes him vulnerable against the 35-year-old kander, a military veteran. story continued below the republican source suggested the ads will link kander to hillary clinton, who is losing in missouri to donald trump, according to public polls. "voters will be left with no doubt that jason kander is a loyal hillary clinton partisan," the republican source said. "jason kander would be hillary clinton’s senator, not missouri’s." democrats are making a significant investment in missouri as the battle for the senate enters crunch time. the democratic senatorial campaign committee is committing $3.5 million to the state. "this is just the latest sign that washington republicans are worried about losing their favorite senator, roy blunt," said chris hayden, a spokesman for kander. "jason clearly has the momentum in the race."      gop spends to shield blunt from tough challenge      
__label__0 sen. elizabeth warren told wells fargo chairman and ceo john stumpf at a public hearing tuesday he should resign in the wake of an unauthorized customer-account scandal, return the money he made while the activity went on, and face a justice department investigation for possible criminality. "it's gutless leadership," warren said of stumpf's response to revelations that the bank opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' permission. story continued below the massachusetts democrat used the closely watched senate banking committee hearing to make her case that the united states needs "tough new laws" to hold corporate executives personally accountable. stumpf left senators dissatisfied with comments that he would have no responsibility in clawing back top officials' pay. he deferred to the rest of the bank's board when it came to questions about decisions involving compensation for executives. "that's unfortunate," said sen. sherrod brown (d-ohio), the panel's top-ranking democrat. senators have urged stumpf to revoke money from retiring consumer banking head carrie tolstedt, who is reportedly leaving the company with $125 million in stocks and options. stumpf said he was not involved with compensation discussions at the board level. though he is the board chairman, he does not sit on the human resources committee responsible for overseeing executive pay. "to not invoke some degree of clawback for yourself and others involved would be committing malpractice from the standpoint of just public relations," sen. bob corker (r-tenn.) said. senators from both parties suggested that wells fargo might have violated sec rules. warren said the agency should also investigate stumpf. sen. pat toomey, a republican running for reelection in pennsylvania, told stumpf that he had been unable to find wells fargo disclosing potential material risks to investors related to the scandal. sen. jeff merkley (d-ore.) said the sec should investigate whether wells fargo violated internal control provisions in the 2002 sarbanes-oxley act by not recognizing and stopping widespread fraud. in an attempt to illustrate what she said was stumpf's personal gain from the unauthorized account openings, warren said wells fargo shares held by stumpf during the period of the scam grew in value by more than $200 million. "if one of your tellers took a handful of $20 bills out of the cash drawer they’d probably be looking at criminal charges for theft," she said. "they could end up in prison. but you squeezed your employees to the breaking point so they would cheat customers and you could drive up the value of your stock and put hundreds of millions of dollars in your own pocket." stumpf, responding to criticism from chairman richard shelby (r-ala.), said,"if i could turn the clock back, and i’ve thought about this a thousand times, of course we all wish we would have done something more earlier. we didn’t get on this fast enough."      warren tells wells fargo's ceo to resign, calls for investigation      
__label__0 donald trump, in hot water over a report that his charity used donations to cover business-related legal fees, told a campaign rally crowd on tuesday that “there’s nothing like doing things with other people’s money.” the comment about “other people’s money” came during a campaign rally in north carolina, where trump pledged to keep refugees from the middle east out of the u.s. and instead put them in “safe zones” that would be built with money from gulf nations. it is a financial maneuver the real estate mogul said he has performed many times throughout his career. story continued below “it’s called opm. i do that all the time in business. it’s called other people’s money. there’s nothing like doing things with other people’s money,” trump said. “because it takes, the risk, you get a good chunk of it and it takes the risk. we’re going to do this, in this case, from a humanitarian standpoint. opm: other people’s money.” under a trump administration, the gulf states would not be the only foreign countries on the hook to pay for the manhattan billionaire’s proposals. from the very beginning of his campaign, trump has pledged to build a wall along america’s southern border and force mexico to pay for it. during trump’s visit to mexico last month, mexican president enrique peña nieto said his nation would not pay for the wall. trump said the subject of who would pay was not discussed during their meeting. the former reality tv star made his promise to use “other people’s money” on the same day the washington post published a story accusing trump of spending $258,000 from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits involving his other businesses.      trump: 'there’s nothing like doing things with other people’s money'

__label__0 donald trump’s presidential campaign has paid his family's businesses more than $8.2 million, according to a politico analysis of campaign finance filings, which reveals an integrated business and political operation without precedent in national politics. the gop presidential nominee’s campaign has paid his various businesses for services including rent for his campaign offices ($1.3 million), food and facilities for events and meetings ($544,000) and payroll for trump corporate staffers ($333,000) who helped with everything from his traveling security to his wife’s convention speech. story continued below in all, the trump campaign’s payments to trump-owned businesses account for about 7 percent of its $119 million spending total, the analysis found. that’s an unprecedented amount of self-dealing in federal politics. even the wealthiest of candidates have refrained from tapping their businesses’ resources to such an extensive degree, either because their businesses are structured in a manner that doesn’t legally allow them to do it with flexibility, or because they’re leery of the allegations of pocket-padding that inevitably arise when politicians use their campaigns or committees to pay their businesses or families. trump, on the other hand, appears to have structured his businesses in a way that lets the campaign use them without legal restriction. and he certainly doesn’t appear to feel any embarrassment about flouting political norms that typically compel candidates to distance themselves from their businesses during campaigns. quite to the contrary, trump — who in 2000 predicted “i could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it” — has used the campaign itself as a marketing platform to promote everything from the difficult-to-find trump steaks to his golf courses and a new washington hotel. trump’s tangle of businesses has raised concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest should he win the presidency, while the trump-branded campaign has drawn mockery and allegations of pocket-padding from trump’s critics. his democratic rival hillary clinton in july accused trump of “spending his meager campaign resources on … himself.” in a statement, the trump campaign said: "mr. trump has largely self-funded his campaign and continues to make significant contributions which far exceed the amounts the campaign is required to pay. the campaign has used known quantities as far as event space, air travel and accommodations, and has fulfilled all fec requirements throughout the campaign.” the degree to which trump or his corporations may be benefiting from his campaign is unclear, partly because the financial and legal structures of his businesses — and their relationships with his campaign — remain opaque. trump has stubbornly refused to release his taxes, which could shed light on the issue. additionally, the campaign’s payments to trump-owned businesses are dwarfed by the $54 million trump has pumped into his campaign. in fact, reports filed with the federal election commission show that more than $500,000 in services such as rent, software and staff from trump-owned businesses were donated to the campaign — including some of the salary paid to trump’s head of security keith schiller, who travels everywhere with the candidate. in those situations, trump likely either wrote off the cost of services rendered by his companies to his campaign, or he personally reimbursed the campaign for the costs of the services. while federal election law prohibits corporations from donating cash, goods or services to campaigns, the regulations do include an exception — and it’s the one that election law experts interviewed for this story say trump is most likely using. it allows people who own certain types of companies — including llcs or sole proprietorships — to donate from those entities to campaigns and have those donations be considered to have come from the person. it’s unclear precisely how trump’s various businesses are structured, but he likely would have to be the sole owner of the ones that are donating services to the campaign in order for those donations to pass legal muster. “most wealthy candidates separate their businesses from their campaign organizations, and that’s partly because their companies are either publicly owned or owned by multiple people,” said gop election lawyer jason torchinsky. he represented rudy giuliani’s 2008 presidential campaign, which paid the former new york mayor’s companies for office space, security and legal consulting, but finished the campaign owing money to them. “it’s unique to have somebody who is independently wealthy and is able to so thoroughly integrate a privately held company into their campaign,” torchinsky said of trump. regardless of how trump’s corporate entities are structured, the campaign is legally required to charge them fair-market rates for goods or services received, even if trump ultimately writes off the bills as donations. there have been allegations that the campaign failed to pay trump’s companies fair-market value for some services, including for the trump corporate staffer who helped write melania trump's convention speech (the campaign paid her $356.01 through trump tower commercial llc), and the corporate lawyer who penned threatening letters to a donor and pac supporting jeb bush. among the goods and services that trump has paid his companies for are $34,500 for lodging and event staging at trump national doral golf course, $48,200 for room rental and catering from the trump national golf club in westchester, n.y., and $142,000 to trump restaurants for rent, utilities, meals and office supplies. it paid more than $1 million to trump tower to rent office space for its main campaign headquarters. trump ice, his bottled water company, got $1,300, while his son eric trump's virginia winery was paid almost $5,000 for catering and event space. the bulk of the spending, almost $6 million, went to a company called tag air for use of trump’s private plane. the campaign has also paid $432,000 to mar-a-lago, trump’s club in palm beach, fla., for lodging, facility rental and catering. and trump continues to simultaneously use and promote facilities he owns, even sometimes using misdirection to do so. one of trump’s primary election victory speeches in march, held at mar-a-lago, was widely lampooned as an infomercial for trump-branded steaks, water, magazines and wine. and last week, he lured the political press corp to his new washington hotel by promising a revelation about his longstanding allegations that president obama was born overseas, which he finally disavowed. before getting to that, though, he took the opportunity to promote the hotel on pennsylvania avenue in the old post office. whatever the campaign paid to use the ballroom in the old post office that day won’t be disclosed until next month’s fec report. but back in january, the campaign spent $5,000 to rent space in the hotel. during a march tour of the hotel, trump boasted to the press that the hotel would have “one of the biggest ballrooms in washington, and by far the most luxurious ballroom." he also quipped that the completion of the hotel would mean he will wind up with a presence on pennsylvania avenue “one way or the other."      trump's campaign paid his businesses $8.2 million      
__label__0 donald trump feels like a man half his age, and hillary clinton is “quite delighted” that the topic of the septua- and sexagenarian’s ages haven’t been an issue throughout their presidential campaigns. both candidates responded to aarp bulletin for the cover story of its october issue, a copy of which was obtained by politico on thursday. trump issued written responses to six of aarp’s 13 questions earlier this month; clinton answered every question during her face-to-face interview in august. story continued below trump, 70, and clinton, 68, were told that age doesn’t seem to be a factor in their campaigns and asked if they feel that’s “a fundamental change in the views of americans toward aging.” trump, the republican presidential nominee, boasted about how young he feels, echoing what he told dr. mehmet oz during an interview last week in which he said when he looks in the mirror he sees a man half his age. trump’s response also included a knock on the democratic nominee, who recently took some time off the campaign trail to recover from a bout of pneumonia. “yes. many americans are living longer, healthier, fulfilling lives,” trump wrote in response to the question. “as i’ve said before, i feel like i’m 35. stamina and energy are important. as is a positive attitude and joy for how you spend your days.” during her interview, clinton expressed her delight in the subject of age being a relatively non-factor this cycle. but she also spoke to the importance of available, affordable health care, a signature accomplishment of president barack obama, and how she wants that for everyone. “i have been quite delighted at the outcomes of the [campaign] for many reasons, but certainly because there don’t seem to be any arguments about age,” clinton said. “people can argue about our policies, our experiences, but i think it goes to show that what we are seeing happen is that if you take care of yourself, if you can afford good health care and get it, you can live a full and productive life much longer than people in prior generations did.” “that’s what i want for everybody. i want everybody to feel they are at their best and that they’re able to continue to make a contribution and enjoy life as best as they possibly can,” she continued. “so i appreciate the emphasis on healthiness and wellness, and that’s something that i want to try to promote in the white house and get older people, not just younger people, to be paying attention—to really take advantage of opportunities and to do more. so i’m excited by what i see as a real opportunity for us to break down the barriers that age has historically posed and to really help people to focus on how they can be as healthy and well as possible for as long as possible.”      what trump, clinton said when they were asked about age      
__label__0 hillary clinton’s nationwide lead over donald trump has tightened to single digits with just three days to go before the first presidential debate between the two candidates. a new mcclatchy-marist poll released friday puts the former secretary of state 7 percentage points ahead of the manhattan billionaire in a head-to-head matchup among likely voters, 48 percent to 41 percent. that lead is down significantly from the 15-point advantage she held in an earlier mcclatchy-marist poll that surveyed registered voters nationwide in early august. story continued below in a four-way race that also includes libertarian gary johnson and the green party’s jill stein, clinton leads trump by 6 points, 45 percent to 39 percent. johnson, a former governor of new mexico, polled at 10 percent and stein polled at 4 percent. respondents preferred clinton on the issue of immigration by a 51-41 margin and on trade by a 52-42 spread. asked which candidate would better address the issue of terrorism, respondents favored clinton, 52 percent to 41 percent. fifty-seven percent of those reached said clinton has the experience to serve in the white house, compared to just 30 percent who said the same of trump. likely voters reached by the poll also gave her the edge on the question of temperament, preferring her by a 50-38 margin. while recent nationwide polls have favored clinton of late, it is trump who has received mostly good news in swing state polling. surveys released in recent days have shown him ahead in north carolina, iowa, nevada and ohio, while another put him and clinton in a statistical tie in florida. winning in battleground states like those are crucial for trump, who faces a relatively narrow electoral path to the white house relative to clinton. the mcclatchy-marist poll was conducted from sept. 15-20, reaching 1,298 adults via landlines and cell phones. of those 1,298 respondents, 758 were considered likely voters based on a probability turnout model. the margin of error for all respondents was plus-or-minus 2.7 percentage points and the margin of error for likely voters was plus-or-minus 3.6 points.      new poll: clinton's lead over trump narrows nationwide      
__label__0 president barack obama used a pseudonym in email communications with hillary clinton and others, according to fbi records made public friday. the disclosure came as the fbi released its second batch of documents from its investigation into clinton’s private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. story continued below the 189 pages the bureau released includes interviews with some of clinton’s closest aides, such as huma abedin and cheryl mills; senior state department officials; and even marcel lazar, better known as the romanian hacker “guccifer.” in an april 5, 2016 interview with the fbi, abedin was shown an email exchange between clinton and obama, but the longtime clinton aide did not recognize the name of the sender. "once informed that the sender's name is believed to be a pseudonym used by the president, abedin exclaimed: 'how is this not classified?'" the report says. "abedin then expressed her amazement at the president's use of a pseudonym and asked if she could have a copy of the email." the state department has refused to make public that and other emails clinton exchanged with obama. lawyers have cited the "presidential communications privilege," a variation of executive privilege, in order to withhold the messages under the freedom of information act. the report doesn't provide more details on the contents of that particular email exchange, but says it took place on june 28, 2012, and had the subject line: "re: congratulations." it may refer to the supreme court's ruling that day upholding a key portion of the obamacare law. it's been known since last year that obama and clinton corresponded occasionally via her private account, but the white house has insisted obama did not know she relied on it routinely and exclusively for official business. a report on the fbi's june 7, 2016 interview with "guccifer" confirms fbi director james comey's claim that lazar falsely asserted that he'd surreptitiously accessed clinton's server. "lazar began by stating that he had never claimed to hack the clinton server. [an fbi agent] then advised that fox news had recently published an article which reported that lazar had claimed to hack the clinton server. lazar then stated that he recalled the interview with fox news, and that he had lied to them about hacking the clinton server." additional fbi interviewees whose reports were made public friday included jake sullivan, clinton's policy planning director; bryan pagliano, a former clinton technology aide; monica hanley, a veteran clinton aide who worked for her in the senate and at state; and sidney blumenthal, clinton’s longtime confidant. hanley revealed in her fbi interview that she had no idea where a thumb drive she used to store an archive of clinton's emails had gone. hanley searched for the thumb drive, which the fbi described as "something she happened to have laying around the house," several times but was unable to find it. the interviews provide more insight into clinton's lack of technical acumen. according to the fbi's abedin writeup, she "could not use a computer"; hanley said clinton had no idea what her own email password was, and had to rely on aides. the so-called "302" reports also detail fbi interviews with former secretary of state colin powell, former cia acting director mike morell, state department official pat kennedy, state department inspector general steve linick, bill clinton aide justin cooper, former diplomatic security chief eric boswell and longtime diplomat lewis lukens. some of the interview reports had the subject's name removed on privacy grounds before the records were released. many of those people seem to be computer technicians or lower-level state department officials. the fbi published 58 pages of documents earlier this month that revealed clinton had relied on others’ judgment to not send her classified material during email correspondences. “clinton did not recall receiving any emails she thought should not be on an unclassified system,” the fbi said in its sept. 2 report. “she relied on state officials to use their judgment when emailing her and could not recall anyone raising concerns with her regarding the sensitivity of the information she received at her email address.”      obama used a pseudonym in emails with clinton, fbi documents reveal      
__label__0 as the two candidates prepare to spar at tonight’s first presidential debate, a new poll has donald trump and hillary clinton tied 46 percent to 46 percent in a two-way race among likely voters. the bloomberg poll, however, has trump ahead by 2 points in a four-way race, with trump earning 43 percent to clinton’s 41. libertarian candidate gary johnson has 8 percent and green party candidate jill stein comes in with 4 percent. story continued below and earlier bloomberg poll in august had clinton beating trump by 6 points in a two-race race. clinton still has a large, but shrinking, lead among likely women voters, besting trump 52 percent to 39 percent. and among voters 35 years or younger, clinton is beating trump 50 percent to 40. but trump continues to lead clinton with white voters 55 percent to 38 percent and with those without college degrees 50 percent to 42. polling averages show a slight clinton lead: realclearpolitics has her 2.1 points ahead, while huffpollster has her leading trump by 4 points. fivethirtyeight has clinton up by 1.1 points. according to politico’s average of battleground state polls, clinton’s lead is 2.8 points in the 11 states most likely to decide the electoral college vote. the poll surveyed 1,002 likely voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1.      poll: trump, clinton tied in two-way race      
__label__0 hempstead, n.y. — hillary clinton and donald trump are counting down the hours to their first debate, a heavily hyped and critical encounter that comes as a fresh batch of polls show the race narrowing to a virtual dead heat. the showdown is expected to be a study in contrasts: clinton, the longtime politician and consummate preparer who has pored over briefing materials in recent weeks, versus trump, a first-time political candidate who, if aides are to be believed, has eschewed many elements of traditional debate preparation ahead of what could be the most watched political event in u.s history. story continued below the two candidates arrive at hofstra university in an increasingly taut race, as clinton’s once-comfortable lead in august has evaporated into a knife’s edge contest well within the margin of error in the most crucial swing states. “a wheel-to-wheel race,” trump’s running mate, indiana gov. mike pence, called it in a radio interview with hugh hewitt earlier on monday. trump and clinton face two fundamentally different questions headed into monday night. for trump: can the celebrity candidate best known only a few short years ago as the star of “the apprentice” demonstrate the gravitas necessary for voters to envision him in the oval office? for clinton: can a woman who has been in the public spotlight for more than two decades — as first lady, senator and secretary of state — ease the electorate’s lingering questions about her trustworthiness? “this debate will have a huge impact,” predicted judd gregg, a republican who played al gore and john kerry in president george w. bush’s mock debate preparations. because trump and clinton enter the debate with historically high unfavorability ratings, gregg said, “i think the person who wins this debate is the candidate who is able to increase their likeability and, at the same time, is able to have americans see them as a leader who will take the country in a positive direction.” tv networks are expecting record audiences with countdown clocks ticking down the hours and minutes in recent days. clinton’s campaign has prepared for two different trumps to show up at hofstra, her aides have said. the first is the insult-throwing bombastic showman who rampaged through republican primaries. the second is the more controlled and sober candidate who has appeared on the campaign trail of late, someone who might even make a magnanimous gesture toward clinton on the debate stage. trump has stayed more disciplined with the help of teleprompters at his rallies and by not subjecting himself to tough questioning in recent weeks, bypassing formal press conferences for 60 days and, for the most part, avoiding extensive interviews with outlets other than fox news. neither of those are options on monday night. but mari maseng will, a longtime gop debate coach, said trump has been so outlandish on the campaign trail for the past 15 months that the typical bar for what counts as misbehaving on the debate stage is unusually high for him. “a sigh wouldn’t do it,” she said, referring to gore’s now-infamous exasperation with bush in the 2000 debates. “the only thing he could do to turn away people… would be mean,” she said. “that’s a killer in american politics, even for him.” trump successfully navigated 11 republican primary debates, but he never had to face one of his opponents one-on-one. indeed, the smallest crowd he competed against was three other candidates, meaning he will have to fill nearly double the amount of time he ever has before on monday. that could prove a challenge for a candidate who has mastered the quick sound bite and quip but lacks the depth of knowledge on policy that clinton has. the debate will last for 90 minutes with no bathroom or commercial breaks. in the hours leading up to the debate, the clinton and trump camps sparred less about each other and more about the role of moderator lester holt, an nbc anchor. clinton backers urged holt to fact-check trump, whose misrepresentations on the campaign trail have far outnumbered clinton’s. “we are concerned that donald trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish,” clinton campaign manager robby mook said on cbs on monday kellyanne conway, trump’s campaign manager, complained about clinton’s “very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs.” but such pre-game spin and expectations-management end at 9 p.m. eastern. then the bright lights will shine on clinton and trump alone.      clinton and trump ready for debate showdown      
__label__0 hillary clinton on monday called on donald trump to apologize to people who have worked on the real estate mogul's properties who have not been paid in full. do "the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they've produced and then refused to pay them?" clinton said at the first debate of the general election. "i can only say that i'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you." story continued below over the course of the campaign, reports have emerged about trump refusing to pay what some vendors said he owed them. "i have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, donald," clinton said, adding that there was an architect in the audience who wasn't fully paid by trump for designing a clubhouse at a trump golf course. "it's a beautiful facility. it immediately was put to use. and you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid what he was charging you." "maybe he didn't do a good job and i was unsatisfied with his work," trump responded. trump went on to suggest that he had only taken that route four times, and that he was within his legal rights to do so. "my obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies," he said. "and that's what i do. but what she doesn't say is the tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and they love me."      clinton to trump: apologize to workers you stiffed      
__label__0 politico politico's must-read briefing on what's driving the day in washington good morning from hempstead, new york. the general consensus is this: donald trump didn’t throw up on his shoes. but hillary clinton had the far better night in their first 90-minute (it actually lasted 95 minutes) matchup here at hofstra university on long island. clinton mostly kept her cool -- as did trump for the first portion of the evening. trump ended up citing sid blumenthal, rosie o’donnell and referring viewers to sean hannity to vouch for his opposition to the iraq war. the pre-debate buzz among reporters here was that trump left himself the option to come to the spin room, but would only show up if he needed to change the narrative. he came to the spin room, and then spoke to hannity live from the press filing center. maggie haberman (@maggienyt) pointed out that “she can’t remember last time, if ever, a general election candidate went to the spin room.” not a good sign for trump. last night hillary clinton ended the debate by saying, “and one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. he loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. and he called this woman ms. piggy. then he called her ms. housekeeping, because she was latina. donald, she has a name...her name is alicia machado and she has become a u.s. citizen, and you can bet she's going to vote this november." story continued below this morning donald trump went on “fox and friends” and said machado was “the worst” contestant they had and chided her for gaining weight. “she was impossible...she was the winner and you know she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem...this was many years ago, and [clinton] found the girl and talked about her like she was mother teresa and it wasn’t quite that way, but that’s okay. hillary has to do what she has to do.” video clip http://bit.ly/2ca06xi (h/t alex burns) **subscribe to playbook: http://politi.co/1m75ubx --what’s next: the next presidential debate -- in st. louis on oct. 9 -- gives trump an opportunity to bounce back. remember: mitt romney trounced barack obama in the first debate. but the second event, which will be held at wash. u., is a town hall, which brings its own challenges for both candidates. clinton mostly skated on some of trump’s signature attacks: benghazi, her private email server, the fbi investigation, immigration and the clinton foundation. trump is certain to hammer away on those issues in the coming weeks, and try to inject them into the conversation in missouri. the vice presidential debate is in farmville, virginia, on oct. 4 -- one week from today. what to watch for: how the down-ballot candidates react. top republican operatives running senate and house races say they weren’t thrilled, but they don’t know that trump’s bad night moves the needle. the early take is that trump was stable for the first 30 minutes, which gives republicans hope that any negative impact will be limited. 42 days until election day. the government shuts down friday. the narrative -- “clinton set the trap and trump walked in: the democrat dominated the debate. will it matter?” by eli stokols: “‘donald was very fortunate in his life, and that’s all to his benefit,’ clinton started. ‘he started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.’ trump quickly dismissed clinton’s characterization, saying he received ‘a very small loan’ that he turned into a company valued, he claimed, in the billions. ‘i say that only because that’s the kind of thinking that our country needs.’ in the moment, he seemed calm—but from that point forward he was anything but. ‘she mind-screwed him from the beginning by mentioning the loan from his father,’ said rob stutzman, a gop operative in california. ‘that was brilliant psychological warfare on her part. he slowly unwound from there, culminating in borderline incoherency over the final 30 minutes.’” http://politi.co/2cynqh0 jmart and pat healy on a1 of the nyt, “candidates press pointed attacks in acerbic debate -- trump raps clinton on trade and email -- she counters on his fitness”: “in a relentlessly antagonistic debate, donald j. trump and hillary clinton clashed over trade, the iraq war, his refusal to release his tax returns and her use of a private email server, with mr. trump frequently showing impatience and political inexperience as mrs. clinton pushed him to defend his past denigration of women and president obama. mr. trump repeatedly interrupted mrs. clinton and at times talked over her throughout the 90-minute debate, making slashing attacks that surely pleased his republican base but may have been off-putting to women and undecided voters. he also left unchallenged her assertion that he paid no federal taxes for years.” http://nyti.ms/2cyicen … a1 pdf http://nyti.ms/2czmy2o --wapo leadall by phil rucker and anne gearan: “donald trump unrelentingly

insensitivity, hiding potential conflicts of interest and ‘stiffing’ those who helped build his business empire … trump … spent much of the evening explaining himself — over his temperament, treatment of women and minorities, business practices and readiness to be commander in chief, as well as over his long perpetuation of a falsehood about barack obama’s birthplace to delegitimize his presidency. ‘he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior, and the birther lie was a very hurtful one,’ said clinton ... ‘barack obama is a man of great dignity, and i could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.’ trump, who earlier this month at last acknowledged obama’s birth in hawaii, replied by invoking clinton’s 2008 rivalry with obama:

recent memory. she knew when to attack and when to explain – and how to pace it all over 90 minutes. donald trump started off great for the first few questions. he had an effective refrain of slamming clinton’s ‘30 years’ of nothing, which resonated particularly well with independent voters. for the first 15-20 minutes, trump’s numbers consistently went up whenever he railed against the current system and all its problems. trump talked a lot about problems. but clinton talked about solutions. ... “at the end of the night, clinton moved the dials more with my group – 16 voters declared her the debate winner, while five said trump won. focus group consisted of 27 participants, all undecided voters from pennsylvania. pre-debate: 10 leaned toward clinton, six leaned toward trump, and 11

for most of the first presidential debate, he stayed there, letting the battleships of hillary clinton and donald trump shoot their missiles at one another. it made for some memorable exchanges between trump and clinton, matched in close-up on most networks. for some debate watchers, that’s what they want their moderators to do: say ‘go’ and let them run. but it also left some gaps where viewers probably expected sharp questions. “there was no probing of trump’s wall with mexico, and vow to get the mexicans to pay for it, or the republican nominee’s ban on muslims entering the country. and he barely prodded clinton to explain her private email server in a question so gently worded that she was able to dispatch the issue with a few taut sentences.the clinton foundation? wasn’t discussed; neither was the benghazi attack. few moderators have faced such intense scrutiny in the days leading up to the debate as holt did, with clinton’s allies demanding he serve as a

__label__0 the first general election debate between hillary clinton and donald trump averaged 84 million viewers across 13 channels, according to data from nielsen, making it the most watched presidential debate in modern history. until last night, the most-watched debate in history was the 1980 debate between jimmy carter and ronald reagan. that debate averaged just over 80 million viewers. with a few networks still to be counted by nielsen, and the 80 million figure not including anyone who watched online, last night's debate will end up with more people watching than any prior presidential debate. in 2012, the first debate between mitt romney and barack obama averaged 70 million viewers. in 2008, the first debate between john mccain and obama averaged 53 million viewers. on cable news, fox news led the way with more than 11 million viewers. nbc led the broadcast networks with more than 18 million people tuning in. the ratings put the debate in rare company. of tv programs that drew an average of more than 80 million viewers, most were nfl super bowl broadcasts, with the others were the finales of m.a.s.h. and cheers. of course, the debate aired on a dozen tv networks and streamed online, whereas the super bowl and m.a.s.h. only aired on one channel each. the numbers do not include anyone watching on pbs, univision or non-rated tv channels like c-span, nor does it include anyone that streamed the debate online. data from facebook, youtube and other digital sources suggests that millions more people watched the debate live online. all told, fox news averaged 11.4 million viewers, including 3.5 million in the key adults 25-54 demo. cnn averaged 9.8 million viewers, including 4.4 million in the demo, and msnbc averaged 4.9 million viewers, including 1.6 million in the demo. nbc averaged 18.1 million viewers, abc 13.5 million viewers, cbs 12.1 million viewers and the pbs newshour 2.96 million viewers. among the business channels, fox business network averaged 673,000 viewers, while cnbc averaged 520,000 viewers.      first trump-clinton debate is the most-watched debate of all time      
__label__1 police have found some very disturbing leads in the chelsea bombing this last saturday. the greatest suspicion is muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. the bomb in chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a dumpster four blocks away.   police are investigating just what happened. while the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press: lead #1 – a hand-written letter, a portion of which was in arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device. lead #2 – a 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: “i’m looking at the explosion down the block. there will be more.” lead #3 – a tumblr page called ‘i’m the ny bomber’ that claims to be the “manifesto” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked new york city saturday night. here. manufacturing test explosives hi. you probably have all seen the news by now, the explosives detonated in new york city, that was me. those were just some tests, i know where i have made errors and i will not make the same mistake next time. i did it because i cannot stand society. i cannot live in a world where homosexuals like myself as well as the rest of the lgbtq+ community are looked down upon by society. it is 2016 and we are still being viewed as mentally ill, sinners, attention seekers, and just plain weirdos in general. i am not going to stand by while under classed and underprivileged people are oppressed. i am not going to stand by while there is inequality in my country such as the racism being seen in white police officers all over the country. i am not going to live in a country where it is ok to have a misogynist, xenophobic, racist islamophobic, republican candidate running for president of the united states! that’s implying that republicans in general should even be taken seriously as they are all cisgendered privileged white people. this is not the end, this is just the beginning. i will be remembered. i will make a difference. i will eliminate my targets before it is too late. someone is lying and it’s just sick that anyone would want to claim this, especially one who didn’t even do it. trying to benefit off of other’s terror is as base as you can go next to being the perpetrator.         note in arabic found with nyc bomb… call says there will be more bombings      
__label__1 when the miami dolphins have their first home game of the season sept. 25 against the cleveland browns, they might not have their customary police escort to the stadium. after four dolphins players refused to stand during the national anthem when it was played prior to their first game against the seattle seahawks, the police union in miami called for a boycott, usa today reports. jeffery bell, the president of the international union of police associations, local 6020, explained: we’ve asked the deputies and the broward sheriff’s office not to do the details anymore. … i respect their right to have freedom of speech. however, in certain organizations and certain jobs you give up that right of your freedom of speech temporary while you serve that job or while you play in an nfl game. ... i can only imagine the public outcry if a group of police officers refused to stand for the pledge of allegiance or if we turned our back for the american flag for the national anthem. there would be a public outcry and internal affairs complaints a mile long on that. in response, dolphins star running back arian foster replied: “they say it’s not time to do this. then when is the time? it’s never the time in someone else’s eye.”  in addition to the dolphins, various players for the new england patriots, kansas city chiefs, and seattle seahawks have protested by either sitting or kneeling during the playing of the national anthem at their games. the protest movement began on aug. 26 with san francisco 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick. despite the warning issued by local 6020, three of the four protesting dolphin players refused to stand when the anthem was played before the sept. 18 game against the new england patriots. only linebacker jelani jenkins caved in and complied. sources: miami herald, usa today  / photo credit: miami herald      police union calls on miami dolphins to stand for anthem      
__label__1 the idea that i might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the obamas is actually making me a little ill. i was done with them after the first few days of the barack obama presidency, but it would appear that hillary clinton has some roles for the president and first lady after her coronation election.  what exactly is first lady michelle obama’s legacy? trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life i’m proud of my country.” i personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#bringbackourgirls” sign. but why remember her when one of the presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration? *insert mechanical applause here* but what would her role be? what is she even qualified to do? it’s not hard to figure out what hillary clinton wants her to do when you remember that clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up your children. if you doubt that, read this tweet:  i mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children? for an additional wave of nausea, read hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology. of course, michelle obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by the washington post. back in february, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “i do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “i have a rest-of-my-life horizon.” this reeks of desperation. is hillary trying to capture the “i don’t like hillary, but i do like the obamas” vote? or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something. either way, i’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of american children. the government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. that is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has ever come out of complete government control over the average citizen.       michelle obama not leaving the white house – hillary clinton has terrifying new role for her!?!?      
__label__1 it looks like fbi director james comey is sitting in a pot of hot water and the temperature is steadily being increased. he let hillary clinton skate completely on the email scandal. he even said she was lying and was guilty, but let her off anyway. no one can figure out why either. comey released highly redacted notes of his interview with hillary clinton. they were practically useless. attorney general loretta lynch is just as complicit for meeting with bill clinton just before hillary testified to the fbi. obviously, briefing him on what hillary should and should not say. congress has repeatedly requested that comey provide certain documents on clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. in a further attempt to get comey to comply, lamar smith of texas has slapped comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.  from the independent journal review: the fbi director’s recommendation to the attorney general not to indict democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton for legal infractions with her private email server while at the state department still has many political observers shaking their heads over the obvious legal double standard. the decision-making of fbi director comey, who recently sent highly redacted notes of his interview process and investigation of hillary clinton, and attorney general loretta lynch, who had a private meeting with bill clinton prior to her case being dismissed, have been highly scrutinized. after grilling comey on the hill, congress requested that the director deliver certain documents so lawmakers could better understand the scope and breadth of hillary clinton’s extra-legal email activities. the director has reportedly failed to deliver, and now congress is once again trying to get transparency. the washington examiner reported: house committee on science, space and technology chairman lamar smith, r-texas, subpoenaed fbi director james comey on tuesday for documents and information related to the security of the private email account and server hillary clinton used when she led the state department. smith asked comey for the documents in a sept. 9 letter, but then issued the subpoena after comey failed to comply with the request. “the committee continues to have questions about the structure and security of the email system used by former secretary clinton and whether she and her staff employed cybersecurity standards required by fisma,” the statement from the committee read. but i doubt they will ever get the answers they are seeking… they will get stonewalled by the obama administration, the fbi and the clintons, just as they always do. we seem to no longer have three functioning separate branches of government in this nation. the executive branch seems to rule over all now, making the judicial branch submissive to it and the legislative branch all but irrelevant. there is no better example of that than the corruption surrounding hillary clinton.        breaking: fbi director james comey – subpoenaed by congress for letting hillary off the hook!

__label__1 what would you do if you were faced with an angry mob shutting down the stretch of road that you’re on? you approach the group and apply the brakes, wondering if they’ll move for you, but not only do they not make any effort to get out of your way, they start coming toward you. remembering the reginald denny affair, you realize that you’re faced with two options: floor it and risk hurting one of the protesters, or stop and risk them hurting you, or worse.  what do you do? maybe it was the way i was raised, but i learned that if you feel threatened and you feel as if it ultimately comes down to you or the person who you believe is planning to do you harm, the answer is absolutely, 100% self-preservation. apparently, i’m not the only one with this set of beliefs. an incident took place on the campus of the eastern michigan university that proves that if you try to shut down a road in protest, you do so at your own risk. watching the video below, you can see that black protesters have completely taken over the street. one small jeep, however, clearly has places to be that aren’t right there at that moment. the driver hits the gas pedal and speeds forward, bumping over a protester. watch the video below:   in case you were wondering if they were upset about the charlotte shooting, the answer is “no.” instead, they were upset about the words “kkk” and “leave n*****s” painted on the side of the school. the words were removed and the school issued an apology, but it was too late, blm was outraged. make no mistake, it’s better to be arrested for running over a protester than to be killed and/or have your property stolen by them because they think they’re entitled to it due to someone painting some mean words on the side of a building. “better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6,” doesn’t only apply to protecting your home and family, but yourself as well. there is no good reason to stop while surrounded by irrationally angry people who just want violence to come to you and anyone else they deem “guilty” of whatever crime they’ve made up today. what would you do if you were in this situation? would you stop, or would you put the pedal to the floor?       blacklivesmatter thugs block the street – regret it when one car drives right over them…video      
__label__1 what a racist asshat this president is. he just came out and spoke on the charlotte riots and it was exactly what i expected… lame and in support of violent radicals. he says the majority of people protesting are doing it the right way, if you can believe it. is the right way killing fellow protesters? is the right way looting and burning? is the right way killing police officers across the nation? what a reprehensible statement and by the way, the exact opposite of what he said over the baltimore riots. you don’t see these people doing the ‘wrong thing’ every once in a while. it’s rampant and getting increasingly worse, which is exactly what obama wants. he’s now pandering to the black lives matter, new black panthers, nation of islam devotees for hillary clinton. if he seems to condone their barbaric actions, he might win their votes… or so his twisted logic goes.  from breitbart: president barack obama dismissed the recent violence and destruction in charlotte, north carolina by rioters reacting to the shooting of an armed african-american man by an african-american police officer. “the overwhelming majority of people who have been concerned about police-community relations [are] doing it the right way,” obama said. “every once in a while you see folks doing it the wrong way. looting, breaking glass, those things are not going to advance the cause.” obama made his comments during an interview with good morning america’s robin roberts at the brand new smithsonian national museum of african american history and culture. he argued that americans should recognize that there was a real problem in the justice system that the protestors in charlotte were reacting to. “i think it’s important to separate out the pervasive sense of frustration among a lot of african americans about shootings of people and the sense that justice is not always color blind,” he said. obama didn’t condemn the violence or the murder at all. he didn’t support the police either. big shocker there. he’s an absolute disgrace to the black community. he always has been. we were well on our way to being a colorblind society until obama started dividing us. he’s a stone cold racist. it was a black cop who shot a black man there in north carolina, but obama managed to make it all about race in the end. typical. he paid weak homage to being peaceful… but that is not what he means and he knows that is not what has and will happen in the streets of america. i guess the difference in north carolina was that the area wasn’t ‘black’ enough and by wording things the way obama did, he greenlighted further violence by black lives matter and other radicals. but hey… vote for hillary!        president obama finally speaks on charlotte riots – “…protesters doing it the right way.”      
__label__1 voters want to know what happened with hillary clinton and her e-mails. and the issue won’t go away… partly because officials keep doing all they can to cover for hillary and make sure she avoids prosecution. they’re dragging it out and trying to block people from seeing her e-mails. they want to make sure that people vote before they can see them… and thanks to one judge, that effort is now a success.   a federal judge just ruled that her e-mails won’t be released to the public until after election day. the fbi recovered a number of e-mails during their investigation into her server scandal, but the majority of them will remain secret for the time being. judicial watch president tom fitton is pointing the finger squarely at the obama administration, blaming them for the delay in releasing the content of the e-mails. “this is an absolutely corrupt process the state department has come up with,” he said. so, what is in these e-mails that is making so many people in the obama administration work so hard to keep them hidden? she must have some pretty scandalous and controversial stuff in there that could ruin her chances of winning. and obama has already declared hillary as his successor, so he is clearly not going to let her campaign go down in flames.   hillary clinton is one of the most corrupt politicians in existence. most people know that already. but what is so worrying here is that she is evidently able to control both the fbi and the department of justice to keep herself out of jail, along with god knows how many federal judges. at this point, why even bother pretending that she’s held to the same laws as the rest of us puny citizens? and as if this all wasn’t bad enough, there are people who want to vote for her… so that she can become president and have even more power and influence than she already does. how crooked and criminal does hillary need to be before these people wake up and realize what a catastrophe she is?         outrage! judge rules to keep hillary’s secret emails hidden from voters until after election day!

__label__1 animal lovers, get your tissues ready, because you are about to bawl your eyes out, especially if you are a dog lover.  you know what? don’t even read further if you are part of the man’s best friend club, you just might regret your decision to get out of bed this morning. news just hit the web that the locally famous three year-old dog named loung, who fell out of a truck last year, landing on a busy route between cambodia and thailand, has been hit and killed by a car as it waited for the return of its owner for over a year. you can start the waterworks as we go into the details. the sukhumvit road, or thailand route 3, is a leading highway between bangkok and cambodia and loung’s owner must not have realized that she had fallen right out of the truck. what’s truly amazing is that the dog refused to leave the area, hoping that one day her owner would return and rescue her.  local people in the village of ban nong khon in chanthaburi province took the responsibility of feeding her as she waited for her owner. after some time had passed, loung became somewhat of a celebrity for the locals and tourists, with many people stopping by weekly to take a photo with the lone dog. many people would occasionally stop by the highway, claiming to be loung’s true owners, but would be met with timidness and distrust, she would run off into the jungle as soon as someone tried to leash her up to take her.   loung unfortunately met her end last week, with many photos of the dead and bloodied dog being released in the newspaper. that distasteful act caused so much outrage from many locals and social media users that the media companies took the photos down. the story has been going viral ever since. a dog lover’s club in thailand has donated money for the funeral expenses of loung…hoping to give a proper burial for such a loyal animal.       famous dog killed in spot she waited a year for her owner to return to!

__label__1 conservatives are so fed up with hearing about these two hollywood stars’ marital problems and i’m right there in that group. there is nothing more boring than people who thrive on gossip and what is going wrong in another person’s life. that being said, i’m sure a lot of you are thinking, “okay, but if she feels that way then why is she writing this story?” the answer to that is quite simple, i agree with jennifer aniston’s boyfriend, who was asked about the split up.  no doubt the media was looking for an answer to the effect of, “she’s grinning ear-to-ear and licking her chops.” the problem with that is, justin theroux refused to indulge them with a juicy, scandalous answer. it’s no secret that most people expect aniston to be pleased that the man who cheated on her is splitting from the woman with whom he had the fling. there has to be at least a deep, dark pleasure, right? if there is, theroux isn’t saying. what he did say is something that i think everyone can agree with, especially men and women who have endured divorce and children of divorce. “as a child of divorce, all i can say is that’s terrible news for those children, and that’s all you can really say,” the 45-year-old star said. “it’s boring to sort of comment on anything else. people are having a bad time. that’s horrible.” you’ll find anyone who is hard-pressed to disagree that divorce isn’t easy on the family unit, even if it is what’s best in the long-run. the first thing i thought when i heard that they were splitting up was, “oh no, those poor babies.” anyone who has felt the effects of divorce was probably thinking the same thing. yes, their relationship was a relatively long one, but that doesn’t mean it was perfect. i just hope they do whatever it takes to make sure those children receive the best of them both and that the babies don’t ever feel like it is their fault that their parents decided to get a divorce. no child should ever have to feel like they are the reason that their parents didn’t stay married.       jennifer aniston’s husband gives honest answer when asked about angelina jolie & brad pitt’s divorce      
__label__1 the san francisco 49ers are now facing fallout from their decision not to cut backup quarterback colin kaepernick.  the santa clara police union has reportedly threatened to boycott 49ers games in response to quarterback colin kaepernick's refusal to stand during the national anthem and his comments on racial injustice and police brutality. members of the union wrote a letter to the san francisco 49ers, which was obtained by kntv, warning that if the team does not take action against kaepernick, "it could result in police officers choosing not to work at your facilities." the santa clara police department is the primary law enforcement agency at levi's stadium, where the 49ers play. about 70 officers choose work during games and are paid as security personnel. the union says about two-thirds of the officers who work at levi's stadium are from santa clara. officers from other departments could be hired if santa clara officers decide not to show up, but saunders says this could create a conflict with the city's contract with the union. santa clara police chief michael sellers urged his officers to avoid the boycott and to put the community's safety first. "the safety of our community is out highest priority," sellers said in a statement, reports usa today. "i will urge the poa leadership to put the safety of our citizens first. i will work with both sides to find a solution. in the meantime, i will ensure we continue to provide a safe environment at levi's stadium." sellers said that he respects kaepernick's right to free speech and that he would encourage all officers to respect the rights of all citizens, no matter whether or not they disagree with their opinions. kaepernick made headlines after speaking out about police brutality and saying that officers "murder minorities." he was also photographed wearing socks depicting pigs in police uniforms. "the 49ers are allowing this to come out from an employee and it's making for a hostile work environment for us at the stadium," saunders said. sources: kntv, usa today / photo credit: austin kirk/flick      san francisco 49ers get bad news after they decide not to cut colin kaepernick      
__label__1 by now we’ve all heard the new reports of pokemon go players wandering around at night, getting their jollies off fictitiously catching fictitious monster animals. alright, maybe ‘jollies’ is a little over the line and i am being inconsiderate to feelings…but this is the real world, not a made up one, and if you want to walk round at night with your eyes glued to your cell phone, not taking into consideration what or who is around you, then by all that is good and decent, you leave yourself open for an attack… no! not by pokemon! by real people who want your cell phone, your wallet and anything else of value that they can find! …think of it as a ‘got to catch em all!’ for muggers… except you’re the pokemon.  well, in this case i’m going to share with you right now, pokemon go twitch user rickeybot was brutally socked in the face by a mugger who walked up behind him and robbed him. what makes this violent outbreak a perfect example to share with other go players is that it was all caught live on the very stream rickeybot was using sunday in new york city’s central park. judging by the background, it seemed as if the grand army plaza, a designated pokestop, was the site of the mugging, according to the map he was using at the time.   rickeybot was keeping his fans up to date using twitter, like most millennials do these days. turns out the twitch user was socked straight in the jaw, which he had scanned at the hospital. amazingly, it was only swollen without major damage, although judging by the video, it would seem as if he smacked his head on the ground or something because of the blood seen on his forehead. so, what’s the lesson we learn from rickeybot, hmmm? well, i could say stop playing a child’s game and grow up, but i realize the world we live in and i would be considered a dreaded, villainous ‘hater’ by the lot of pokemon go adult children…so instead, i say play on, my pokemon go brothers and sisters! muggers need to make a living too.       watch a pokemon go streamer get robbed & assaulted live!

__label__1 drugs can be a hell of a way to ruin your life. it takes a hold of your life, turns it upside down and very rarely ever lets you go.  another drug that has taken the streets by storm is the drug spice…otherwise known as k2. its toted as giving the same effects that marijuana does, but it’s synthetically made, so it doesn’t occur naturally. also, a small detail to this drug is that it completely drives the user batshit crazy! there have been multiple reports of the drug being used on the streets, with the results being bodies of people completely strung out, laying around on the roads and sidewalks. now of course there are a plethora of different types of the drug, all ranging in different highs. the user themselves matter as well, with some claiming that the high is just as good as marijuana, without any real adverse effects…then there are others, like this guy, who have complete nightmares…   in the case of this man, he believed he was receiving cannabis straight out…no doubt he was familiar with it as he stated: ‘don’t tell me how to smoke weed, man’. he had no idea what he was actually smoking was indeed spice. this led to his elevated mood at first, relaxation and then ultimately an altered perception of reality…this was supposed to be a joke…i’m sure everyone that cares about him is just laughing their heads off about it. the mean was seen stumbling and falling all around, while the wastes of life were laughing and taking their sick advantage of the situation. the video ends with him completely laid out on the ground, with the idiots around him mumbling and walking off. drugs are a hell of a freak show when someone is under their influence. best to take this video as a reminder to stay away from this particular one…if you don’t want to see your skin melt right off of you.       video: soon after this guy tried the drug k2, he was rolling around on the ground      
__label__1 the attacks are here. they are not new and they are not going anywhere. they could be virtually for the most part eliminated from our shores, but that would take the leadership and a government body that was willing to go against the grain when other world leaders are in their weakness, condemning america for being ‘racists’ or ‘xenophobes’. leadership that is willing to admit that what we have been doing up until now doesn’t work, in fact, it enables further attacks and further slaughter of american innocents. leadership that wholeheartedly denies the erroneous communistic way of thinking known as political correctness.  none of these things will ever happen. they cannot happen. not until the leaders of this nation stop weighing and measuring the quid-pro-quo way of doing business. every day what is brought out on talk radio, on news networks, by hollywood, is more feeling and thoughts of how to handle the day’s latest political crisis. the latest gag by hillary clinton or the recent back peddle by donald trump, and a large portion of america, the majority, is scratching their heads saying, “are these the two best candidates in the entire nation?” any hope of a better candidate swooping in and saving the day is a false hope. the truth is we did this to ourselves. we appoint our elected officials and they in turn make the decisions that we as a town, city, county, state and a nation have to deal with. one of those major decisions is how we combat terrorism. i say terrorism because we as a people can’t even come to the same conclusion that terrorism for a very long time has solely been perpetrated by islamic fundamentalists. after this weekend’s attacks, america has been reminded that the war isn’t over. the war on our culture and way of life rages on, even if the tragedys are out of sight, out of mind. senator ted cruz has released a statement that is dubbed ‘a clear-eyed’ approach to combating terrorism: “terrorist attacks over the last several days across our homeland, from manhattan to minnesota, indicate we are moving into a new phase of the war against isis and al qaida, who are increasingly targeting europe and the united states. two years ago, a focused, aggressive military campaign against isis’s claimed caliphate in syria and iraq might have effectively destroyed the terrorist group, but isis has instead spent the last year seeding radicals in the west, disguising jihadis as refugees and radicalizing muslim citizens online and encouraging them to remain in the u.s. and fight here. meanwhile, other networks such as al qaida and the taliban remain determined to resume the attacks on america that began on september 11, 2001. as we confront this new phase, we must avoid the trap of misconceiving these attacks as isolated incidents somehow disconnected from the larger ideological struggle against jihad. it is past time to take off the blinders and call the enemy what it is: radical islamic terrorism engaged in a coordinated campaign designed to disrupt our very way of life. we must start by fully supporting our law enforcement community, from the heroic off-duty officer jason falconer, who neutralized the terrorist in the st. cloud mall, saving many lives, to the fbi officers in new york who have worked swiftly to identify and apprehend the likely mastermind of the weekend bombings. we also desperately need the active participation of american muslims who see the jihadis for what they are: the enemies of all who celebrate freedom and tolerance. congress should act to prevent americans who have traveled abroad for training from returning here, and to stop the flow of refugees from hotbeds of terrorism in the middle east that president obama is determined to bring to our country. we can’t overcome our enemies by pretending they don’t exist, and undermining our first line of defenders. only together, clear-eyed and determined, can we defeat this foe.”   the first step is recognizing that we have a problem. ted cruz, as well as so many other patriots have. but none of this is going to have even a remote chance of coming to fruition if we as citizens continue to choose leaders that have proven themselves to be corrupt and unworthy stewards of this god-given nation.       is this the best america has to offer? how islamic terror must be fought.

__label__1 jim carrey might just be saying goodbye to his acting career, this is so crazy. jim carrey is one of the most well-known actors across the world. he is mostly known for his role in comedy films such as “ace ventura” and “dumb and dumber.” unfortunately, the actor is in some trouble and it might just be the end for him.  jim carrey was hit with hard news last september when he found out that his 28-year-old girlfriend cathriona white committed suicide. apparently she had left a suicide note to jim before overdosing. after finding out about her death he immediately released a comment sharing how shocked and heartbroken he was. “i am shocked and deeply saddened by the passing of my sweet cathriona. she was a truly kind and delicate irish flower, too sensitive for this soil, to whom loving and being loved was all that sparkled. my heart goes out to her family and friends and to everyone who loved and cared about her. we have all been hit with a lightning bolt.”  when the police showed up to investigate the crime scene they found 3 different prescriptions on white’s nightstand. ambien (sleep aid), percocet (painkiller), and propranolol (blood pressure/heart). tmz reported that all of the medications were prescribed by the same doctor but they were under the name arthur king, which was jim carrey’s alias. this wasn’t cathriona’s first time trying to kill herself. it was reported that she attempted an overdose in 2012 after her father passed away. now carrey is being accused of supplying his ex with the pills that took her life. the lawsuit claims that carrey gave the pills to cathriona just 3 or 4 days before her death. it also states that jim tried to cover up the fact that he gave her the pills by texting her asking her if she had taken them from his house. not only that, but apparently she was already taking painkillers weeks before her death.  of course, carrey knew that she has struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts so it is crazy to think that he would actually give her the pills knowing her mental state. it was understood that the couple had broken up not long before cathriona committed suicide and she even said that she couldn’t go on without him in her suicide note. “i’ve spent 3 days now in disbelief that you’re not here. i can go on brokenhearted and try to put the pieces back. i could, i just don’t have the will this time….i’m sorry you felt i wasn’t there for you. i tried to give you my best part. i don’t really know about burial or that sort of thing. you are my family so whatever you choose will be fine…please forgive me. i’m just not for this world.”  this is so wild!      jim carrey facing major charges, he could end up in prison      
__label__1 it has been 15 years now that we have been fighting the war on terror. while during george w. bush’s presidency, we had very few terrorist attacks on american soil. but since barack obama has been president, that has changed, especially over the last year. there have been shootings and bombings… and yet obama is refusing to change anything. after welcoming thousands of muslim refugees from syria, we saw an uptick in terrorist attacks… yet, obama has plans to allow over 110,000 more to enter the united states next year. they have to be muslim, of course, because racial profiling is the worst thing anyone can do, ever! well, according to obama and his fellow liberals, anyway. but that’s exactly what we should be doing, according to kiss front man gene simmons. according to him, if we want to win the war on terror, we need to start profiling everyone… even him! check out the video below:   “everyone needs to get smart. i’m okay with profiling,” simmons declared. “i want you to stop me first. i want you to stop me because i look a certain way. and if i’m clear, than profile someone else. it’s emergency powers during war. there’s a war going on.” but it’s unfair, liberals will certainly cry. simmons had a response to that, too. “it is unfair,” he said. “that’s why the words ‘too bad’ exist.” it’s kind of sad that the leader of a classic rock band has more common sense than liberal politicians do. yes, profiling isn’t “nice.” but being nice doesn’t prevent terrorism. profiling does — just look at israel, which is surrounded by countries full of terrorists eager to literally wipe them off the map, yet they’re not only still there, they’re one of the strongest countries in the world. somehow, profiling works well for them.   muslims are not all terrorists. we know that. but most terrorists in today’s world are, in fact, muslims. there is nothing wrong with taking a closer look at young muslim men, for example, to ensure that they don’t have ties to any terrorist organizations like isis. if they don’t, then what’s the problem? liberals complain that profiling violates people’s constitutional rights, yet somehow, they’re perfectly fine with that when it comes to second amendment rights. they’re all about gun control, because if it saves even one life, we should do it, even though it infringes upon our constitutional rights. yet profiling is completely unacceptable? get real, liberals. you make no sense.       kiss’ gene simmons: “you want to win the war on terror? profile everyone, profile me!” [video]      
__label__1 the black lives matter movement claims that racism is endemic among the country’s law enforcement agencies — and hillary clinton evidently agrees. rather than understanding that there are a few bad apples in any profession, they paint all police officers with a racist brush. and now, she’s found a new opportunity to pander some more. terence crutcher is a black man who was shot by police officers in tulsa, oklahoma. crutcher was unarmed and in the police video, can be seen with his hands in the air and his back to police when he was first tazed and then shot. at no point does crutcher make any aggressive moves towards police, yet for some inexplicable reason, he was shot and killed anyway.   the video makes it clear: this was murder, plain and simple. and the officers responsible should be fully prosecuted. there’s no getting around that. but of course, hillary used it as an opportunity to smear all police officers, and to stoke racial tensions. appearing on the steve harvey show, hillary talked about the crutcher shooting. “we gotta tackle the systemic racism, this horrible shooting again, how many times do we have to see this in our country?” she asked. “this is unbearable and it needs to be intolerable.” lucky for us, hillary has a solution to this nationwide problem: vote for her, of course, and these shootings will end!   “maybe i can by speaking directly to white people [and] say, ‘look this is not who we are. we’ve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias’,” she said. “we can do better. we have got to reign in what is absolutely inexplicable.” while she did pay lip service to the many “good honorable cool-headed” police officers around the country, she had absolutely no problem whatsoever exploiting this tragedy in an effort to get more votes. and that’s despicable. she couldn’t even wait for crutcher’s family to bury him before she started using him as an opportunity to ask people to vote for her. isn’t she ashamed? is she not embarrassed? because really, she should be. what she’s doing is blatant race-baiting. it’s infuriating that liberals can so easily inflame racial tensions for their own gains, while calling everyone else racist. they’re trying to start a race war, and they’re doing it so they can place themselves in positions of power. that’s disgusting.       hillary clinton vows to defend blacklivesmatter agenda by dealing with white people to stop ‘racial police shootings’ [video]      
__label__1 angelina jolie and brad pitt were one of hollywood’s most high-profile couples. but apparently, that is all over now: angelina jolie has just filed for divorce. jolie, 41, cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for splitting from her husband of just two years. pitt and jolie married in 2014, but their relationship controversially began while pitt was still married to actress jennifer aniston, in 2004 while they were filming the movie mr. and mrs. smith. pitt and aniston divorced in january of 2005 and just months later, pitt and jolie went public with their relationship with her adopted son maddox. jolie adopted another child, a girl from ethiopia, and then announced that she was pregnant with pitt’s child. the couple adopted another child in 2007 before giving birth to twins in 2008.   while pitt and jolie had been together since 2004, they didn’t get engaged until 2012. the pair reportedly were waiting to get married until lgbt couples could also get married. reports say that jolie was angry with pitt’s parenting style. she allegedly felt that pitt was not safe around their kids, was unhappy with his alleged marijuana use, and thought he has anger issues. it has also been reported that jolie hired a private detective to spy on him while he was filming his latest movie in london, because she suspected that he was cheating on her. those suspicions were allegedly confirmed by the detective. jolie is also known for her humanitarian work and is a united nations special envoy, recently appearing before the un to speak on behalf of syrian refugees. pitt, meanwhile, was reportedly much more interested in being part of hollywood, making movies and going to parties.   it has been reported that jolie is requesting sole custody of the couple’s six children and is seeking to have pitt be given visitation rights only. attorney laura wasser is said to be representing jolie in the divorce, who also represented actress amber heard in her divorce from johnny depp earlier this year.       angelina jolie files for divorce from brad pitt – for reasons you wouldn’t have guessed [video]      
__label__1 obama’s time as president is almost over and millions of americans are counting down the days until he vacates the oval office. he promised before taking office that he would fundamentally change america and he did… for the worse. it’s hard to believe that his legacy will be remembered fondly once he’s left office, considering that virtually everything he has implemented has been a miserable failure. but that hasn’t stopped him from patting himself on the back anyway — and telling americans that they need to protect his legacy once he’s left office. in a speech to the congressional black caucus on saturday night, obama used jim crow laws and slavery in an effort to encourage people to vote for the “right” candidate. he told the people assembled that his legacy was at stake, so they needed to give him a good send off by registering people to vote. and those people, of course, need to vote for hillary clinton.   while obama did not mention hillary by name, he said it would be an insult to him if the black community does not support her. “my name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,” he said. “and there is one candidate who will advance those things. and there is another candidate who’s defining principal, the central theme of his candidacy is opposition to all that we have done.” he then cited the historic turnout among the african-american community in 2008 and 2012, saying, “i will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down it’s guard and fails to activate itself in this election. you want to give me a good send off? go vote!”   of course, history contradicts everything that obama said. it was democrats, not republicans, that supported slavery, segregation and jim crow laws. the republican party was formed specifically to end slavery. the original congressional black caucus were the first black members of congress… and they were republicans. democrats came up with the ku klux klan in order to prevent black americans from voting. meanwhile, obama’s actual legacy with the black community isn’t exactly stellar. it was the obama administration that cancelled d.c.’s school voucher program, so that low-income minority children could not go to expensive private schools, like the one obama’s children got to attend. and under obama’s leadership, unemployment and food stamp usage have skyrocketed, hitting the black community harder than any other. he’s done nothing about the destruction of the black family, the disproportionately high number of black babies aborted every year, or the fact that almost 76% of black children are born out of wedlock. and he wants to brag about his legacy? is he out of his mind?       obama tells america to protect his legacy – thanks himself for all the “great things” he’s done in 8 years [video]      
__label__1 another celebrity files for divorce, and this one shocked us more than all the rest! we have seen many couples file for divorce over the past several months but this one might have shocked us more than any other. tmz reported that angelina jolie filed for divorce from brad pritt, and the reasoning will astound you.  apparently angelina filed for the divorce on monday and cited irreconcilable differences. the reasoning for the divorce request was that she didn’t appreciate the way brad interacted with his children. we don’t really know the details behind the story, but what we do know is she wants out. not only that but after filing for the divorce, angelina requested full physical custody of all of their children. she did request that brad get visitation rights, but she does not want to have joint physical custody of the children – assuming it has something to do with the conflict behind the divorce.  sources close to the couple shared with tmz that angelina was not happy with the way that brad was parenting their children. apparently she was really disappointed in the methods he was using to parent. laura wasser who is ripping jolie stated that the separation date was september 15, 2016. she stated that jolie is not asking for spousal support. the couple has been together for over 12 years and has been married for 2!  we have been swooning over this couple since the debut of their big film “mr. and mrs. smith” and it is heartbreaking to see them throw in the towel so soon. their divorce was a total shock to all of us and we almost can’t believe it! they seemed so happy together! please keep this family in your prayers as they trudge through this sad divorce. especially for all of their beautiful children!  this is so heartbreaking! i love brangelina!      breaking: iconic holllywood couple just called it quits after 12 years      
__label__1 george bush sr. is now 92 years-old. do you remember him? he was the 41st president of the united states and gave an infamous speech for the 1991 state of the union where he famously said: “what is at stake is more than one small country; it is a big idea: a new world order, where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind — peace and security, freedom and the rule of law. such is a world worthy of our struggle and worthy of our children’s future.” calling the united states a ‘small country’ was insult enough, but to decide to use america as a tool to ‘achieve universal aspirations of mankind’ is quite another. mankind doesn’t have any ‘universal aspirations’. it’s hard enough to get americans within the same culture to agree on one thing, let alone the whole world of many cultures. i am no conspiracy theorist, but the phrase ‘new world order’ was coined by our 41st president, so we will have this discussion with that one thing in mind.   it was reported that george h.w. bush and former first lady barbara bush wanted to stay silent about the upcoming race for the presidency and who they support. but former maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late robert f. kennedy wanted to find out who bush sr. was supporting for the presidency. she asked him and then immediately took a selfie with him and posted his response on facebook.   “the president told me he’s voting for hillary!!” in a telephone interview, townsend said she met with the former president in maine earlier today, where she said he made his preference known that he was voting for a democrat. “that’s what he said,” she told politico. asked about townsend’s post, george h.w. bush spokesman jim mcgrath in an email replied, “the vote president bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days. he is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim.” i guess my question to you is this: does it surprise you that the man who said the united states is small and that we must unite in a ‘new world order’ might be voting for hillary clinton? they are very similar in belief. while president, bush sr. allowed many of the u.n. entrapments to sneak past our congress. he introduced the u.n.’s common core education, which is an arm of agenda 21 into our education system in the 90’s. hillary clinton also believes the united states to be small and should be more under the reign of u.n. treaties and such. they are not very different at all. now trump? that guy is not part of that elite group trying to ‘achieve the universal aspirations of mankind’. he’s all for himself which means in turn he would be the kind of president who would be all about the united states. he doesn’t believe the u.s. is one small country, like a cog in a machine. trump believes that the u.s. is the machine. trump’s are not the type of ideals that bush wants in the white house. it’s dangerous because before you know it the united states would become a sovereign nation in the world once again and then what happens to all the bush’s and clinton’s work? many former gop officials from both bush administrations have also announced their support for clinton over trump, including national security adviser brent scowcroft and former commerce secretary carlos gutierrez. one bush official who has taken trump’s side is former vice president dan quayle, who told politico in an interview this summer he was still holding out hope both bushes would back trump. “clearly in their heart of hearts i should hope they would want a republican president, but they can speak for themselves,” quayle said in an interview in july. dan quayle was such a stud and polar opposite to ghw bush. it was very sad for our country to end up with bush sr. after reagan and not a dan quayle.       george h.w. bush to vote hillary clinton – releases this statement after news breaks…      
__label__1 over the past several months, the american public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the clinton foundation since hillary clinton was secretary of state. well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. according to the daily caller, the foundation, aids program distributed “watered down” drugs to third-world countries. from the daily caller: former president bill clinton and his clinton health access initiative (chai) distributed “watered-down” hiv/aids drugs to patients in sub-saharan africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by the daily caller news foundation. — the chai program to help aids victims is considered one of the clinton foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. — the possibility that chai distributed adulterated and diluted aids drugs to third world victims could shake the foundations of the clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate hillary clinton’s campaign. — the congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between bill and two controversial indian-americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the food and drug administration (fda) and the securities and exchange commission. the most troubling revelations concern the clinton foundation’s vigorous promotion of ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the fda. it is unclear at this juncture how many aids patients received the “watered-down” drugs. this latest report proves that the clinton foundation should be shut down immediately rather than serve as a means of enriching bill and hillary! do you think that the clinton foundation should be shut down immediately before it continues to harm more and more people around the world? share your thoughts below!         site navigation bill and hillary clinton have a major aids scandal!      
__label__1 hillary clinton recently appeared on jimmy fallon’s the tonight show. jimmy fallon was all jokes about hillary’s health as he reached under his desk and grabbed a surgical mask and put it on. i’m guessing that was his way of pushing the idea that hillary’s health issues are nothing more than the flu or bad cold.   hillary of course laughed her cackling laugh with the audience and then fallon high-fived her. after touching her hand, fallon reached under the desk for some hand sanitizer. i admit it was a funny gag. fallon is a clever guy and will do all he can to help his candidate of choice. voters do have a right to be concerned and many medical professionals are: hillary’s health concerns serious, say most doctors polled by the association of american physicians and surgeons (aaps) concerns about hillary clinton’s health are “serious—could be disqualifying for the position of president of the u.s.,” say nearly 71% of 250 physicians responding to an informal internet survey by the association of american physicians and surgeons (aaps). about 20% said concerns were “likely overblown, but should be addressed as by full release of medical records.” only 2.7% responded that they were “just a political attack; i have confidence in the letter from her physician and see no cause for concern.” while more than 81% were aware of her history of a concussion, only 59% were aware of the cerebral sinus thrombosis, and 52% of the history of deep venous thrombosis. more than 78% said the health concerns had received “not enough emphasis” in the media, and only 2.7% that there had been “too much emphasis.” so this is how you treat the presidency of the united states. make fun of voters concerns over the health of candidates who may become president of the united states. i’m so disgusted with the left and the irony of it all is that liberals are upset with fallon’s satire on hillary’s health. boy they are a bunch of dumb nuts. watch here:         video: jimmy fallon sparks mother load of “hurt feelings” from liberals after roasting hillary clinton…      
__label__1 cnn recently ran an article titled, “donald trump defends racial profiling in wake of bombs.” now, let’s first ignore the fact that once again, cnn is more upset over how we talk about the terror suspect and his religious affiliation than the fact that he allegedly set off bombs intended to hurt people and shot at cops during his capture. cnn claims trump “reiterated his support for the controversial practice of racial profiling by police amid increasing threats to the homeland.” translation: donald trump is a raaaaaaacist!  but here’s the thing. trump never even mentioned racial profiling. he was praising israel’s extraordinary vetting methods, which involves profiling, especially at the airport. and guess what? it works for them. “our police are amazing. our local police — they know who a lot of these people are. they are afraid to do anything about it because they don’t want to be accused of profiling and they don’t want to be accused of all sorts of things,” trump said. “you know, in israel they profile. they’ve done an unbelievable job, as good as you can do. but israel has done an unbelievable job, and they’ll profile. they see somebody that’s suspicious, they will profile. they will take that person and they’ll check out,” he continued. “do we have a choice? look what’s going on. do we really have a choice? we’re trying to be so politically correct in our country. and this is only going to get worse.” profiling doesn’t necessarily mean racial profiling. cnn completely made that up, because they want to advance the false narrative that trump’s a giant racist. cnn even admitted that trump didn’t actually say “racial” profiling in that very article. trump did not say on what attributes he would encourage police to profile possible suspects, but it’s illegal for police to subject us persons to disparate treatment based on their race or other protected status. so trump “did not say on what attributes he would encourage police to profile possible suspects,” but in the very first paragraph, cnn definitively claims that he “reiterated his support for the controversial practice of racial profiling by police.” they made a claim and basically debunked it two paragraphs later. in what world is that considered fair and balanced reporting?      cnn caught adding a word to donald trump’s comments to make him look bad      
__label__1 according to this, the arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities. case in point. the specific law criminalizes any contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. for real. this is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, az parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids. the az supreme court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” they ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. so much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right? in others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. there’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. see? just trust them. wow. there are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. but here’s an especially interesting tidbit: as fordham law professor john pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: it utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in america are resolved. given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. with the state supreme court’s help, arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. this terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. barring intervention by the u.s. supreme court, due process has now been suspended for arizona’s parents and caregivers. yikes. but i’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. we should just trust the government on this, y’all. because doesn’t government always know best?      changing your baby’s diaper is now a sex crime in arizona      
__label__1 what exactly is the point of the fbi? i know what they say they’re supposed to do, but what is their actual purpose? i mean, if you tell them and you know that someone in your family is engaged in terrorist activity and it coincides with the rise of isis and they do nothing, what are we paying them to do exactly? i hope they feel terrible about themselves and what’s more, i hope they are ordered to pay the medical bills of the victims, as well as the pain and suffering and lost wages. what is the point of the government telling us “see something, say something” if when we see something and say something, nothing comes of it until the attempted murder of american citizens?  ahmad khan rahami, the man who is being accused of creating and/or detonating hidden ieds in new york/new jersey, was captured by police. afterward, it was revealed that his own father had reported him to the federal bureau of investigations in 2014 for “being a terrorist” according to the new york times. two years before ahmad khan rahami went on a bombing rampage in new york and new jersey, his father told the police that the son was a terrorist, prompting a review by federal agents, according to two senior law enforcement officials. the father made the statement about his son being a terrorist to new jersey police in 2014, when mr. rahami was arrested after a domestic dispute and accused of stabbing his brother. the information was passed to the joint terrorism task force led by the federal bureau of investigation in newark. officers opened what is known as an assessment, the most basic of f.b.i. investigations, and interviewed the father, who then recanted. it is thought that the father only made the comment out of anger at his son, but it was very clear that he knew something he didn’t actually want the fbi to investigate. is the father also accountable for his son’s actions for recanting a statement that was clearly true and putting decent, hardworking americans at risk? or is this just on his son, who was the actual creator and distributor of the explosive devices? in my opinion, there’s enough blame to go around. obviously, the actual terrorist himself receives the bulk of it, but i also would like to point my finger at the father who (it would seem) hid what he knew about his son’s activities and the fbi who didn’t continue the investigation.       breaking: ny/nj bomber’s father told fbi his son was a terrorist two years ago…      
__label__1 with yet two bombings and stabbings being committed within a 12-hour span, america has been reminded that we are the target of both homegrown hatred and the fanatical cult-like fallowing of a medieval ‘religion’. as expected, the two candidates running for office gave their comments on the matter..  but it was only one that really caught the attention of the media and not for what was said, but rather how it was delivered. hillary clinton used her response to a new york city bombing saturday night to yet again take a swing at donald trump, but opponents and the media wondered if she was swinging while she was under the influence of something else. a tranquilized-sounding clinton looked as if she was dazed out of her mind, as well as looking as if she was about to drop over and fall asleep. she spoke with the media pool that have been following her around on the campaign: “i’ve been briefed about the bombings in new york and new jersey and the attack in minnesota. obviously we need to do everything we can to support our first responders, i’ll have more to say about it when we actually know some facts.” as she was giving her take, a reporter asked about donald trump’s reply and if she had any further comment on it. “i think it’s important to know the facts about any incident like this. that’s why it’s critical to support the first responders, the investigators who are looking into it trying to determine what did happen. i think it’s also wiser to wait until you have information before making conclusions because we are just in the beginning stages of trying to determine what happened,” she said. twitter has gone crazy over the interview, with many followers saying they believed clinton was either drugged up, or she just didn’t have the energy to wake herself up in a time of need. either, or – it’s not presidential material.  is she highly medicated or what?? rt @abcliz: hillary clinton, on her campaign plane, responds to explosion in nyc pic.twitter.com/yg4vi1grqt — ordinarytoad (@toadonawire) september 18, 2016         video: hillary’s ‘presidential’ response to weekend bombings, labeled as ‘zombie’-like

__label__1 hollywood loses yet another one of their dearest actresses, and we are heartbroken. she was born in chicago illinois on december 27, 1942 and loved by anyone and everyone who came in contact with her. many of you probably remember the legendary actress as liesl von trapp from “the sound of music.” charmian carr definitely left an imprint on hollywood, and she will never be forgotten. tmz reported the death of the 73-year-old on sunday september 18, 2016. carr’s rep stated that she died from complications from dementia. apparently she was battling a rare form of the disease.  carr’s story was a very unique one, which makes her acting journey so special. at the time that she auditioned for “the sound of music” she was a student at the san fernando valley state college. she was studying speech therapy and philosophy, and was also working for a doctor. “i was going to college and getting extra spending money by modeling in fashion shows in one of the stores. one of the girls who modeled with me knew that robert wise, producer-director of the sound of music had been conducting a four-month search for someone to play the part of 16-year-old liesl. my friend, without my knowing it, sent in my picture and explained in a note that i sang and danced. i received a call from mr. wise to come for a tryout. it took me completely by surprise…”  after completing “the sound of music” and several other acting parts, carr left her career in acting and pursued another life-long dream of hers. charmian started her own interior design business “charmian carr designs” and surprisingly it took off a lot easier than she expected – especially after being hired by michael jackson. carr married jay brent who was a dentist in 1967 and 24 years later the couple got a divorce. they had two beautiful daughters together. she is survived by all of her siblings, her daughters and her grandchildren.  she brought joy to everyone around her and even still today she is known and loved by those who watch her shows. her smile lit up every room she walked into and her positive personality was contagious. please continue to keep this family in your prayers as they mourn the loss of their loved one. i can’t help but watch this over and over and think that there will never be anyone who could replace this woman!  rip charmian carr.      breaking: hollywood legend just died of terrible disease      
__label__1 footage of the explosion that took place in new york on saturday night is now being shared across all social media sites. an explosion on saturday night in what is known as new york’s “chelsea neighborhood” left over 29 people injured. mayor bill de blasio said that the explosion was definitely intentional, but as of now they do not believe it to be a specific terrorist threat. at a late night news conference after the explosion blasio spoke saying that they are at full alert now. “there is no specific and credible threat to new york city from any terror organization. we believe at this point in time this was an intentional act. i want to assure all new yorkers that the nypd and … agencies are at full alert…whatever the cause, new yorkers will not be intimidated, they will not let anyone change who we are…”  the explosion on saturday night wasn’t the only concern either. authorities and examiners went searching the area on sunday and found another explosive near the area of the explosion on saturday night. a random pressure cooker was found about four blocks away from the site that the bomb went off. the police department tweeted around 2:30am stating that the device had been safely removed. “the suspicious device on west 27 street in chelsea has been safely removed by the nypd bomb squad…”  new york police commissioner james o’neill said that the explosion wasn’t a natural gas explosion but they also don’t have any other leads on the cause of the explosion either. they are treating the area as a crime scene in hopes to protect residents from harm. “the investigation is active and at this time an extensive search is being conducted. the area around the explosion site is being treated as a crime scene.” watch the leaked video below, you can see the explosion and then you will see people running everywhere. this is so crazy!  please pray for all of those who were injured….this has got to stop!      breaking: footage leaked of nyc bombing, watch before it’s deleted      
__label__1 hillary just gets punked over and over again these days. her latest embarrassment came at a rally where some guy yelled, “hillary for prison!” to which hillary replied, “let’s make it happen!” the entire nation finally agrees with hillary clinton on something. but i’m sure she got confused (yet again) and didn’t mean to say that. she must have misheard the guy and thought that he said something like, “hillary for president!” funny and pathetic all at once. not to be outdone, elizabeth warren posed for a selfie with someone she thought was a hillary supporter… not so much. she got punked as well with the young man saying, “but you lied about your ethnicity!” he also said hillary would lose to trump which caused a back and forth. that just made it worse for warren. cringeworthingly humiliating. (photo: getty) from infowars: hillary clinton was caught in an embarrassing moment when someone at her rally yelled “hillary for prison!”, to which the presidential candidate responded, “let’s make it happen!”  the cringeworthy moment was captured on film. given her now notorious propensity for being constantly “confused,” hillary probably thought the man was saying “hillary for president!,” but nothing could be further from the truth. the “hillary for prison!” meme has been going on now for some time. born out of a frustration that she has not been held accountable for even the slightest of her crimes, the slogan reflects the mood of america. and trump has capitalized on it brilliantly. ‘hillary for prison 2016’ has become the theme of the grand old party – americans see what the hildabeast is… the most corrupt politician to ever run for office in our country. since the gop convention, it has been the rallying cry of those who support donald trump and even those who don’t. hillary’s own associates and friends say that she is corrupt beyond belief. between the scandals plaguing clinton and her severe health issues, trump is now leading her in the polls. and with the renewed terrorism threats and the support of the police union, trump is sure to surge even further ahead. clinton looks frail, weak and tainted… if the country is besieged by terrorist attack after attack, they will turn to a strongman like donald trump and beg for his leadership. god help us. america is changing and not for the better. be careful what you wish for, you may just get it.         clinton’s response to “hillary for prison”?! “let’s make it happen!” [video]      
__label__1 soooo embarrassing for hillary, clinton. in delaware, ohio, clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. one guy, who was documenting it for donald trump, showed up. he was it. no one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one. i watched south park last week and they joked that clinton had maybe four supporters. it’s looking more and more like that is just about right. there are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the hildabeast.  from gateway pundit: at hillary clinton’s ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the democratic presidential nominee. but, when this donald trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. in fact, the only hillary supporters at the offices were the staff running the headquarters. when the man said he was a trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door. the staffers for hillary clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. they must have been so disappointed. the clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. it was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. the fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. if this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by donald trump in the coming election. i wonder if you go to events like this in each state for clinton what you would find. i have a feeling it will be eerily similar. this has got to have the democrats in a panic. hillary clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. if that is true, where is everyone? trump’s rallies are packed with thousands of people… he’s making her look ridiculous. there is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for clinton at this point. clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. when support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point. between trump leading in the polls, the enthusiasm factor, hillary’s health, her corruption and terrorism concerns, it’s beginning to look more and more likely that the trumpster will be the next president.         secret video records massive hillary event flop!      
__label__1 the fbi has just released their snazzy new wanted poster for the terrorist who is behind the chelsea bombing in manhattan. he is a natural born afghani and considered armed and extremely dangerous. ahmad khan rahami is 28 years-old and they have his face everywhere now. it has been reported that he has left notes and made calls that indicate there will be more bombings. i’m sure they are looking into his connections with the five bombs found in new jersey this morning – one of which exploded when a robot approached it. i heard yesterday that they believe the same individual who made the bombs in manhattan also did the ones in new jersey. the apartment where this man lived in new jersey has been raided by the fbi. undercover agents and members of the fbi’s joint terrorism task force were taking part in the raid above a chicken restaurant. the home was roughly one mile from the site where investigators found the five suspicious devices in a backpack, one of which exploded, outside a train station.  from the independent journal review: law enforcement released the name and photo monday of 28-year-old ahmad khan rahami, who is “being sought in connection” with this weekend’s new york city bombing, according to nypd spokesman peter donald:  the attack injured 29 people in new york city, although fortunately all of those wounded have already been released from hospitals.according to abc news: ahmad khan rahami, dob 1/23/88, is wanted by the fbi in connection with at least one nyc-area bombing, the fbi says. the address of a home being searched by fbi agents in elizabeth, new jersey is linked to a person with a similar name. the wanted poster is below:  federal authorities conducted a traffic stop of a “vehicle of interest” in the chelsea bombing sunday night in brooklyn. a law enforcement source told fox news that a “number of individuals” who are possibly connected to the explosion were taken into custody. it’s laughable that de blasio and others are now calling it terrorism, but say there is no connection to international terrorists. these guys are liars and deeply stupid. rahami is the man captured on surveillance footage planting the bombs. there is other physical evidence linking rahami to the devices that have gone off or been found in new york and new jersey. the pipe bombs were filled with shrapnel and were meant to create many casualties. we are very lucky no one has died yet. there is now a search on for this guy nationwide and the clock is ticking.       breaking: fbi releases wanted poster for terrorist of chelsea bombing!      
__label__1 sharia law is one of the greatest evils of mankind and women are overwhelmingly the subject of this evil. yet somehow, so-called “feminists” turn a completely blind eye to it. women can be oppressed and victimized with not even a peep about the injustice of it all. the latest example that will surely not bother today’s feminists comes out of turkey, where a woman was kicked in the face by a man for committing the crime of wearing shorts. the kicker is that a turkish court declared that he had done nothing wrong. 23 year-old ayşegül terzi works as a nurse in istanbul and she was riding a bus when her attire caused a muslim man on board to fly into a rage. so, he did what comes naturally — for muslim men who follow sharia law anyway. he violently attacked her, kicking her in the face while screaming, “those wearing shorts must die!”   three other men tried to step in and stop the attack. the entire brouhaha was also caught on camera. the 35 year-old man responsible was caught and he confessed to everything. he admitted to police that he attacked the woman, saying, “the shorts she was wearing were not appropriate. that’s why i was angry and behaved so.” insanely, the turkish court agreed with him. he was released when the court found that he had done nothing wrong. and while american pretend feminists couldn’t care less about the plight of turkish women who live in fear and oppression, actual feminists in turkey have been speaking out about the violence against women. hundreds of women are killed every year, many times by their husbands.   but of course, why should anyone worry about things like spontaneous violent attacks because of the clothes women are wearing, or the systemic abuse and even murder of wives by their husbands? clearly, that’s not real oppression. real oppression is what women in the united states go through, because they have to wait a day or two before they can get an abortion and they have to pay for it themselves. and sometimes, on college campuses, people say things that women don’t like. why is everyone so worried about muslim women when it’s american women that have the real problems… right, feminists? this is why modern feminism is such a joke. these harpies whine about utterly inconsequential garbage, while actual women are suffering. they should really be ashamed.       court ok with muslim man kicking woman in face for wearing shorts [video]      
__label__1 this weekend, a bombing in new york city rocked the nation as americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. donald trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a “bombing/” cnn, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that — even though hillary clinton described the attack the exact same way. so cnn edited out hillary’s wording. and donald trump just ripped them a new one for it. in the cnn footage, they only showed clinton responding to a question from a reporter, where she agreed that trump was “insensitive” for calling the chelsea bombing a “bombing.” jake tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized trump for jumping to conclusions. both times, the network did not air clinton’s own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter’s question.   trump was interviewed on fox and friends and he held nothing back. “cnn is disgusting and disgraceful,” he declared. “these people are the most dishonest people, cnn is so disgusting and dishonest, and i watch it, it’s so unfair, they call it the clinton news network. she used the word ‘bombs’ also by the way… i was criticized for calling it correctly – what i said was exactly correct.” he also pointed the finger at “stupid” leaders going soft on terrorism. “well it’s a mess and it’s a shame and we’re going to have to be very tough,” he said. “i think we’re going to see a big change over the last couple of days, i think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country.” he explained that “because we’ve been weak, out country’s been weak, we’re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands, and as i’ve been saying you’ve got to stop it.”  .@realdonaldtrump slams "dishonest" cnn for editing out clinton reference to nyc explosion as 'bombing' pic.twitter.com/eg2yy63b4y — fox & friends (@foxandfriends) september 19, 2016   obama was heavily criticized by trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 syrian refugees in 2017 — and hillary wants to make that number even higher, according to trump. “hillary clinton wants to increase what he’s letting in and he’s letting in thousands of thousands of people… they can’t be properly vetted,” said trump. “he let in over 100,000 additional people and now hillary clinton is raising it by 550 per cent… thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we’re doing. our leaders are – i don’t even say weak – i say stupid.”       cnn furious and embarrassed after trump called them out for one major thing      
__label__1 saturday night, an islamic immigrant went on a stabbing spree at a minnesota mall, injuring nine people. he was heard invoking the name of “allah” and asking people if they were muslim before he stabbed them. but the terrorist was brought down by an off-duty police officer, jason falconer, who shot him as the terrorist tried to attack him. falconer is a former police chief of the albany police department, where he still works part-time. but what the media won’t tell you is that he is much more than just a police officer. falconer is the owner and president of tactical advantage, llc, a shooting range and training facility that focuses on training and arming concealed carriers. falconer is also a member of the united states practical shooters association (uspsa) and is an nra-certified firearms instructor.   of course, why would the media point out that being proficient in firearms is a good thing? it doesn’t fit in with their gun control narrative. and this is someone who isn’t just a police officer using his department-issued firearm to stop a terrorist; it’s a firearms instructor who has a passion for training people and promoting concealed carry. it’s like a liberal nightmare.   more and more americans are choosing to get concealed carry permits, despite the liberal push for more gun control. yet jason falconer is a perfect example of why owning guns is so necessary. we live in a dangerous world, with religious fanatics intent on murdering as many of us as possible. liberals would have you cower in fear with no way to defend yourself. people like jason falconer want to help teach you to defend yourself. is there really any question as to which is better?       man who shot mall terrorist has secret identity [video]      
__label__1 the bombings in new york city and new jersey had everyone thinking one thing: terrorism. officials didn’t want to jump to conclusions though and refused to link the attacks to a specific motive without having proof first. well, they have their proof now. the fbi has detained five people, they’ve gathered more evidence and it is almost certainly islamic terrorism. the five men the fbi detained are all from afghanistan. and there’s one more person free, who authorities are trying to find. his name? ahmad khan rahami.  watch: the moment @stevedoocy's phone received the emergency alert regarding ahmad khan rahami live on air pic.twitter.com/qmfy1xoeta — fox & friends (@foxandfriends) september 19, 2016   officials currently believe that the five men they apprehended were on their way to the airport. a total of five bombs were eventually found, bombs that were homemade, yet still sophisticated enough that the makers would need to do some research and have a decent amount of knowledge regarding bombs. there was also a letter written in arabic found inside a plastic bag — the same plastic bag in fact that held the bomb itself.   yet liberals were attacking trump for describing the attack as a bombing. we’ve seen this kind of dishonesty from the liberal media before. remember the orlando nightclub shooting? that was another instance of islamic terrorism, yet liberals turned it into an issue of gun control and homophobia, despite the fact that the shooter was a muslim radical. there’s no way that we can effectively fight islamic terrorism if we can’t even acknowledge what it is. donald trump, for all his faults, is at the very least willing to call a spade a spade. if we allow liberals to put their agenda before national security, then it will be impossible to keep this country safe.       trump was right again, bombing suspect details just released!

__label__1 harassment is known in arabic as ‘taharrush’. mass sexual assault of women in public has been documented in egypt since 2005 and they recently began calling it the game of ‘taharrush’. muslim men rape and assault women in public while hiding under protective cover of large gatherings. the muslim men feel it’s their right because of the misogynistic ideology that women shouldn’t be leaving the house alone and deserve to be shamed using sexual violence. assailants will create multiple rings around the woman to keep out anyone who tries to rescue them. it’s a really sick practice and women experiencing it could be groped, stripped, beaten, bitten, penetrated with fingers and raped. these muslim gang rapes have grown and spread since 2012 when large protests in egypt took place punishing women for attending such protests.   so, it stands to reason that a mass flood of muslim men who feel that the taharrush of women is okay into western countries would result in lots of gang rape. this particular story is of an illegal algerian immigrant who beat a woman unconscious in an attempted rape, who was arrested and explained to the judge what he was doing in austria. he told the court that he came to australia to “f*ck the women.” based on his actions and his previous convictions across europe, he most likely means to rape women as is the custom of some young muslim men. after the gang rape, the woman was left lying unconscious in bushes near the bus stop. she had some serious injuries and is considered to be psychologically scarred permanently. luckily, she found a student who helped her. that student testified that, “the woman came up to me and was covered in blood. you could not see her face. she said to me: ‘i was raped.’” this wave of sexual assaults in austria and europe is only going to increase as the migrant population swells.         migrant reveals sick reason he left…’to f*ck the women’      
__label__1 both of the 2016 presidential candidates had their chance to speak out about the recent bombings in new york and new jersey. there are so many differences between donald trump and hillary clinton, just in these videos alone. watch!  what a difference in donald trump and hillary clinton’s responses to last night’s nyc bombing. trump said, “i must tell you that just before i got off the plane a bomb went off in new york and nobody knows what’s going on,” trump said during a rally last night at an airport hangar in colorado springs, colorado. “but boy we are living in a time — we better get very tough, folks. we better get very, very tough. it’s a terrible thing that’s going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.” these comments came just minutes after the explosion occurred.  hillary by contrast, looked like she was half asleep (or even drugged) during her response, in which she contradicted herself within a period of forty seconds. at the 0:28 mark in the video below, she states ““i’ve been briefed about the bombings in new york and new jersey, as well as the attack in minnesota.” then, at 1:08, she was asked ““do you have any reaction to the fact that donald trump, prior to taking the stage tonight, called the explosion tonight a bomb, and if that’s an appropriate term”?” hillary, apparently unaware that bombings are caused by bombs, replied “well i think it’s important to know the facts about any incident like this, that’s why it’s critical to support he first responders, the investigators, who are looking into it to determine what did happen.”  what could she possibly think was the cause of the explosion? a brain fart? the difference in the professionalism between these two is beyond me. hillary clinton is obviously proving herself to not be well enough to run a country. she just needs to drop out and rest.      hillary caught on camera having complete memory lapse during reaction to recent bombings…      
__label__1 now we find out that not only is ahmad rahami a terrorist and a murderer, he’s an entitled whiner. ahmad rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in elizabeth, new jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the tri-state area… you know, his culture.   in the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. the family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. ahmad, 28, his father mohammad sr., 53, and his brother mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘muslims don’t belong here’. the lawsuit, filed in the federal court in newark, says that the family are from afghanistan and are all muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.   from april 2009 for two years they allege that they were unfairly targeted for staying open past 10pm despite being permitted to do so. the lawsuit says that the police had a ‘reckless disregard and deliberate indifference for plaintiff’s constitutional rights of liberty, due process and equal protection’. the elizabeth police department allegedly ’embarked on a course to harass, humiliate, retaliate against and force their business to close at 10pm’. the lawsuit claims that the officers told them there was ‘too much crime around here’ and that the area around the restaurant was ‘known for criminal activity’. the irony of it all is that just 5 years later, ahmad was arrested for the very same thing he was fighting. hmmm, it’s not like a person goes from selling fried chicken to building bombs in just 5 years, right? i’m wondering if anyone else can believe that ahmad went off the reservation because he felt like he was being targeted for being a muslim or if it’s more believable that ahmad is a muslim who happens to be an extremist and he’s been planning this for some time.         new york bomb suspect sued police!      
__label__1 bill clinton has a slew of ex-girlfriends who i’m sure want to take a shot at hillary, but one of them is actually doing it. once you listen to what he has to say about mrs. clinton and the reason she believes hillary is having suddenly noticeable health problems, you’re going to find yourself agreeing. dolly kyle, who i had never heard of before right now, is the author of hillary: the other woman and has a long, sordid past with the former president of the united states bill clinton. the book details some horrible interactions with the clintons, including a situation where hillary actually blew up at a group of handicapped children while serving as the first lady of arkansas.  kyle may have hit the nail on the head with her keen analysis of the hillary clinton health issue. “i really think she has been ’cruisin’ for a bruisin’, as we say in the south, because she’s such an angry person and so driven by this inner rage,” said kyle. “people like that eventually break down, physically.” but, she asserts, hillary’s “inability to keep her lies straight” is not necessarily attributed to her anger, but “cognitive impairment.” i can’t say that i disagree. i’ve known several people who are just hateful and angry and they have a tendency to suffer from more physical ailments than the rest of us. of course this isn’t going to be true of all people, but i have personally noticed a correlation between angry people and mental issues. but kyle says that anger is not the only strong emotion clinton feels. “that paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” warned kyle. “i call her ‘hillary scissorhands’ because of her predilection for destroying records which could get in the way of her goals.” i recommend buying dolly’s book if you don’t already have it, because it is a disturbingly deep look into the behaviors of a woman who may very well become the next president of the united states. and with so many people, including former secret service agents, telling stories similar to the ones that kyle has written about, there has to be some measure of truth to them. do you think that clinton’s health issues may be related to her behavior and attitude as a person? let us know in the comments of our facebook page!       bill clinton’s ex-lover and friend makes bold claim about hillary’s health!      
__label__1 i would say our president is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance. he has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? this is just tone deaf to the nth power.  i’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. that being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in new york and new jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in st. cloud, minnesota. while you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong. surely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election. well apparently your president doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. in fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in new york, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser. are you outraged yet? it gets better. in lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of rush limbaugh and fox news (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet i’ve ever seen, including msnbc), claiming that they are the reason hillary clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes. he bashed trump while lauding hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related. critics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in new york and i would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. i will be making a more in-depth statement later as i receive more details.” and then move on to the business of the hour. but no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that. disgusting.       obama’s speech in new york shocks americans when he says this about attacks!      
__label__1 democratic national committee interim chairwoman donna brazile appeared on msnbc’s “am joy” on sunday and discussed democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton’s collapse on sept. 11. what was intended to be a compliment turned out to be a major admission about the severity of clinton’s health that day. “although she had to be lifted into that van, you know what? she got up, like most of us, she got up and she kept fighting, so that’s the hillary clinton that i hope people get to know,” brazile said, breitbart reported. this is the first time someone from team clinton has admitted that the former secretary of state had to be lifted into the van, and that’s big news because it means clinton was not in control of her body. talk about bad news getting worse. brazile thought she was giving clinton a compliment, but she slipped up and essentially made things worse for clinton by admitting the former first lady had to be lifted into the van. the question that will be on the minds of many people is exactly when hillary got up on her own and what was needed for her to do so. while clinton has admitted to being diagnosed with pneumonia, that doesn’t get rid of her other chronic condition — lying to the public. she said she didn’t tell the public about her diagnosis because she didn’t think it was a big deal, but if she pays just a little bit of attention to the news, she would have known the her health is a huge concern — one she should not be ignoring. clinton’s episode on sept. 11 was serious, and many people across the globe saw it — including world leaders who could view her condition — whatever it is — as a weakness, and attempt to take advantage of it. share this story on twitter and facebook and let us know what you think about donna brazile’s statement that clinton had to befitted into the van. do you think hillary is fooling anyone about her health? scroll down to comment below!      shock: dnc chair slips up, mistakenly reveals what really happened as hillary got in van      
__label__1 the clintons understand the average american. they know what it’s like to be dead broke. hillary clinton is so a woman of the people. she’s just like you. (except for making millions of dollars off the backs of the taxpayers and suffering from disingenuous lying seahag syndrome). bill clinton is just like you! (minus being an unapologetic rapist, of course.) chelsea clinton is just like you! (except for getting paid $600,000 a year by nbc to basically do nothing.) bill and hillary are notorious for charging a sinful amount of money to speak at events. we’re talking $250,000+. luckily, their daughter chelsea is a lot more affordable. she’ll speak and take some photos for a measly $65,000. that’s it. talk about a bargain. but wait– it gets better! the hillary clinton campaign held a super fun “conversation with chelsea” event at penn state university wednesday. and look. the clintons understand that college students aren’t made of money, so they decided to charge students $500 to attend the event. a student could also get a picture with chelsea for a small donation of $1,000 and could get access to the reception for $2,700. talk about a deal! so $500 bare minimum. i mean, $500 is nothing to a broke college student, amirite? just kidding. even college students– individuals famous for being progressive clinton worshipping robots– thought it was ridiculous that hillary would charge students hundreds of dollars to have a “conversation” with chelsea. “although we certainly support chelsea’s right to campaign on her mother’s behalf, we do not agree with mrs. clinton choosing to make this ‘conversation’ available exclusively to individuals who can afford or are willing to pay at least $500,” said ethan paul, vice president of college progressives of penn state, the newspaper reported wednesday. “it is particularly deplorable that a $2,700 donation—the legal limit—gets a personal conversation with mrs. clinton.”   “putting such an expensive price on involvement in elections really hurts college students who already feel there is no point to politics,” added college progressive secretary kathryn van develde. but listen, kids. hillary understands you. she really does. and she thinks it’s ridiculous that you have to go into debt to just obtain a degree. please pay $2,700 to talk to her about it. h/t washington times      clinton campaign charges college students $500 to attend ‘conversation with chelsea’ event      
__label__1 the problems surrounding the clinton foundation continue to worsen. we know that over half of hillary clinton’s meetings during her tenure as secretary of state (85 of 154 people) were with individuals who either donated to her slush fund or pledged to support one of its international programs. we know the clinton foundation accepted donations from sketchy foreign entities. we know half of the staffers paid under the gsa program also worked for the clinton foundation. we know hillary’s former chief of staff at the state department, cheryl mills, also worked for the clinton foundation while working for the state. we know the clinton foundation spent 10 percent of its budget on charitable grants in 2013.  the clinton foundation claims that “88% of our expenditures go directly to our life-changing work,” but one has to wonder. how does spending $8.5 million (or 10% of the budget) on travel– plane tickets, hotel accommodations, etc.– change lives? heck, $4.8 million (or 5.6 percent) of the 2013 budget went toward office supplies. dead serious. blank paper and staplers are pricey, i guess. call it “overhead” all you want, but it’s absurd. just take a deeper look. if you didn’t think it could get any worse, i’m sorry. you’re wrong. in 2014, only 5.7% of the clinton foundation’s budget went to charitable grants. everything else covered staff salaries, travel and other benefits. the organization’s irs filings revealed that it spend just short of  $91.3 million in 2014. of that, $5.2 million went to charity. around $34.8 million went toward staff salaries and benefits, and $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses.” oh. and $851,000 was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” fundraising can be expensive. hillary knows all about that. basically, the clinton foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013 but somehow managed to increase employee compensation and “other expenses” by $5 million each. the clintons are super charitable though. they donated over $1 million to charity last year! who cares if $1 million went to their personal slush fund? they are so compassionate. just kidding. vice president joe biden can’t even get himself to say that the clinton foundation is ethical. h/t daily caller      only 5.7% of the clinton foundation’s budget went to charitable grants in 2014      
__label__1 i’m probably going to a very not good place for laughing at this, but i can’t help that it’s so dang funny!  there has been a theory floating around that hillary clinton is just a robot disguised as a human. while that may seem out-of-this-world ridiculous, remember that she admitted to “short-circuiting.” i’m fairly confident that this is not a term that people often use to describe their forgetting something of importance. and then, adding to the pile of evidence to validate this theory is this little gem picked up from the twitterverse:  some guy right in hillary’s face: hillary for prison hillary: let’s make it happen i almost feel sorry for her https://t.co/ckfdsuashb — jenna abrams (@jenn_abrams) september 18, 2016   when some man yells “hillary for prison!” right in her face, hillary responds with a strangely enthusiastic “let’s make it happen!” now i’ve never been to prison so i’m not entirely confident about this, but it would seem that it’s not a place that you would be that excited to go to. if that doesn’t have you rolling on the floor with laughter, this screengrab might:  awesome. just… awesome.        video: man yells 3 brutal words in hillary’s face & her response is unintentionally hilarious      
__label__1 the jonbenet ramsey case has plagued america for 20 years, now. who would want to murder such a beautiful young girl? what would their motive be? how could they have pulled it off in a way that would stump law enforcement for two decades? in the last month, stories about the case, including a cbs special, a&e documentary and a dr. phil interview with the girl’s brother, have come to the forefront. have we finally evolved enough technologically speaking that we can now determine who murdered little jonbenet ramsey?  the biggest break in this case was the audio picked up by the 911 dispatcher after jonbenet’s mother, patsy ramsey, tried to hang up the phone. at the time this occurred, technology was just not good enough to determine who was speaking or what they said. now, however, the audio could be slowed down and we can finally hear this potentially critical piece of audio. keep in mind as you read this that jonbenet’s father john ramsey was and perhaps still is considered a suspect in his daughter’s murder. from perezhilton: what clemente (pictured above) and the rest of his team discovered was a voice that sounded like the beauty pageant contestant’s father, john ramsey, saying, “we’re not speaking to you,” followed by patsy saying, “what did you do? and “help me, jesus.” on top of that, it also sounds like, what specialists believe to be a small child, possibly nine-year-old burke ramsey, saying, “what did you find?” after this point, a female voice can be heard saying, “we’ve called the police, now what?” additionally, the ransom note was determined to have taken approximately 21 minutes to write according to investigators and is said to have contained several lines from the movies dirty harry and speed. another odd coincidence was the fact that the ransom demanded was about equal to the amount that john ramsey was given as a bonus that year. perhaps the most bizarre finding of all was the “maternal language” that linguistics experts say was noted in the letter. not only this, but the misspellings that were included in the letter appeared to have been placed there on purpose, so suspicion would point to a person for whom english is not their native language. but as the experts concluded, english was the first language of whomever wrote the letter. could all of this information be pointing not only to the father, but to the parents as a team?       new audio evidence revealed in the case of jonbenét ramsey that may point to the killer      
__label__1 anyone who has ever struggled with some kind of addiction knows that it is not easy to break the habit. whether you’re addicted to nicotine, alcohol, meth or crack, even being 24-hours sober seems like a monumental achievement. one woman, an ex-heroin addict, showed reddit what happens when you decide to turn your life around and free yourself from the clutches of addiction. you can’t argue with the results, either.  addiction is a mental, physical, emotional and spiritual event, for want of a better term. getting sober is tough for that very reason, but it’s necessary for the well-being of everyone involved, meaning the family and friends of the addict, as well as the addict themselves. the woman in question began a downward spiral into heroin addiction after her abusive boyfriend convinced her that it would make her feel better about the problems in her life, including losing custody of her daughter. she says that after 8 months of daily use and several failed attempts at getting sober, she finally told the judge in the case that she wanted to get clean. she was found in contempt of court and went to jail for 36 days before heading to rehab. as you can see in her mugshot, this woman – who is unnamed – was feeling the physical and emotional affects of her disease. when she finally became dedicated to getting clean, her whole life changed, as is evidenced in this “after” picture, where she is 826 days sober, and counting.  she added the following to the end of her reddit post: ‘there are other addicts out there who are in the same circle of hell that i was in in that mug shot. so even if one of those people see this and get their sh*t together, then it was worth it.’ if you or someone you know is struggling with any kind of addiction, please know that it is okay to seek out help for them. you’re not intruding on their lives and while they may be furious with you for a period of time, they will come to see that you did what you had to do to make their lives better. there is no reason that someone should have to suffer from addiction for one more day.       ex-heroin addict shows what being clean for 826 days will do for you      
__label__1 here’s the thing: one does not have to love america. this is a free country and if one feels the need to disrespect this nation, there are not – nor should there be – legal consequences.   however, let’s be very clear: there is no law that mandates that people should be able to say whatever they want, whenever they want and remain free from encountering consequences. if i told my boss to shove it, it would be wrong for me to end up in jail for the supposed crime. however, is it not fair that i should be fired or otherwise demoted or reprimanded? similarly, the nfl has the authority to punish the ingrates who refuse to stand for the national anthem. they have chosen not to and thus, many are choosing to boycott the nfl, including this author. others are making consequences clear: as several miami dolphin players continue to demonstrate their hatred for the country that affords them the opportunity to make millions upon millions of dollars doing what they love, a police union in miami has weighed in and asked sheriff deputies to not perform security details for the players anymore until such a time that they begin to show a little gratitude towards this nation. jeffery bell, the president of the international union of police associations, local 6020, said: “we’ve asked the deputies and the broward sheriff’s office not to do the details anymore.” the union has asked police units to stop providing protection for the players at a time when fans and former fans have begun to vent their outrage towards the players. some have even taken to burning dolphins gear. “i respect their right to have freedom of speech. however, in certain organizations and certain jobs you give up that right of your freedom of speech temporary while you serve that job or while you play in an nfl game,” bell said. if these ingrates are so convinced that blacks are being persecuted by police – a central premise in the platform of black lives matter – then they should not receive the benefit that these supposed bigots afford.       police union asks deputies to not escort dolphins until the team’s players stand for anthem      
__label__1 president obama routinely paints a rosy picture regarding the war on terror. he assures us that isis is decimated and that we have little to fear from the looming presence of radical islam throughout the world.   he’s wrong. not only are we engaged culturally in a very serious war with radical islam, at best, our military efforts can only be described as hindrances to the advancement of the murderous elements of islam. however, as weak as our response to isis has been, it is satisfying to see that our airstrikes are making life more difficult for the terrorist factions that require money to wage war. according to an iraqi source, isis has begun harvesting the organs of their dead and dying in order to traffic the organs for cash as our airstrikes decimate their oil fields and rob them of the riches therein. “special medical unit of the organization proceeded to steal human organs for about 23 isis militants of those who slept in the hospitals of nineveh,” the iraqi source said. “what has been stolen from those members included the kidneys, intestines and more; they were transferred under tight control to affiliated hospital on the outskirts of the city.” the source who wished to remain anonymous for obvious reasons, said that the move comes as a reaction to the decimation of oil fields. “this came after the loss of the majority of sources of financial funding, particularly with regard to crude oil, which it provides about 80% of the imports of the terrorist organization.” it is gratifying to see that isis must tighten their belts. however, what the world needs is a complete and thorough domination and destruction of radical islam and so long as the western world confuses idiocy with tolerance, it’s unlikely that we will see the leadership necessary to fix this problem.       isis is so hard up for cash that it’s harvesting organs from its own dead and injured members

__label__1 u.s. women's soccer star megan rapinoe could face disciplinary action if she continues to kneel during the national anthem before games. despite an official statement from u.s. soccer stating that both coaches and players are expected to stand at attention during the national anthem, rapinoe continued to kneel at the sept. 18 game against the netherlands, protesting what she believes to be injustice and oppression in the united states.   rapinoe first began her protest in solidarity with san francisco 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick, who announced that he will not stand for the anthem as long as there is continued police brutality and racial prejudice in this country. his statements and actions have created a national movement, with athletes like rapinoe following in his footsteps.  her actions in particular have angered u.s. soccer, which released a statement saying that her protest goes against everything the organization stands for.  "as part of the privilege to represent your country, we have an expectation that our players and coaches will stand and honor our flag while the national anthem is played," the statement reads in part, according to espn. while she wasn't immediately punished for her protest, espn reports that the situation will be re-evaluated if rapinoe continues to kneel throughout the rest of the season. during a home game against the netherlands, rapinoe was met with some backlash when she refused to stand for the anthem, with one fan yelling, "stand up!" nonetheless, rapinoe has no plans of quitting her protest and is willing to risk suspension in order to make a statement.

__label__0 president barack obama hasn't changed his assessment of donald trump after monday night's debate: the gop nominee, he said on tuesday, lacks the preparation and temperament for the presidency and can't be trusted to address serious threats like nuclear weapons and climate change. the president unloaded on trump during an interview with ryan seacrest in the wake of trump's showdown with hillary clinton, which he watched from the treaty room of the white house. story continued below obama touted clinton’s performance and her qualifications for the presidency, saying “she’s serious and does her homework.” and he blasted trump for not having the “preparations and the temperament or the core values of inclusion and making everybody, you know, have opportunities that would take our country forward.” the president said his two biggest concerns for his daughters’ generation are the spread of nuclear weapons and the onset of climate change — adding that trump falls short on both. "i get worried when i hear somebody like donald trump start saying, 'well, i don't necessarily know whether japan or korea should be protected by us. maybe they should get their own nuclear weapons.' that shows somebody who doesn't pay attention to these issues, and you don't necessarily want close to the nuclear button,” obama said. (trump objected to a similar characterization of his views on east asia during monday's debate, saying it was "wrong.") obama also took a shot at trump for suggesting, in a november 2012 tweet, that climate change is a hoax created by china. the concept of global warming was created by and for the chinese in order to make u.s. manufacturing non-competitive. — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 6, 2012 "when you hear somebody like trump say he thinks this is a plot by the chinese, that this is a fraud and a hoax, when 99 percent of scientists are saying you've got to do something about it," obama said, "that worries me." kellyanne conway, trump's campaign manager, said in a tv interview on tuesday that he believes climate change is "naturally occurring."      obama weighs in on the debate      
__label__0 bill clinton on tuesday defended his own economic legacy and accused donald trump of being woefully ignorant when it comes to trade deals and keeping jobs in the united states. at an event in ohio, the former president conceded that not all trade deals have worked. but he went after trump in a wonkish and detailed manner, especially when it came to one of the examples the republican nominee singled out during the primetime debate monday night. story continued below “they were talking about that closing in indiana, that carrier air conditioning plant, you remember that last night,” clinton asked the audience. “they don’t make air conditioners there, they make furnaces. but it is a carrier company.” during the debate, trump called the north american free trade agreement the “single worst trade agreement ever approve in the country.” the treaty was first negotiated by president george h.w bush, but clinton was in the white house when the deal was finally signed. trump singled out the example of carrier closing the indiana plant and shipping jobs to mexico as one of the reasons the u.s. has been ripped off by the pact. not so, said bill clinton. “her opponent blamed nafta, but that’s not really what happened. you want to know what happened? it’s really important you understand this, because any president who wants to trade with other countries has got to take this into account.” clinton said carrier wanted to break the union in a rush toward profits and in turn blew off an offer from employees to try to save the midwestern plant from going to mexico. “they wanted to break the union, make the money in a hurry and give it to their activist shareholders, we used to call them raiders, and give it to their ceo. so an american president, until we go back to being a stakeholder country, where corporations take account not just their most active shareholders, but their workers, their communities and their customers and their future, we have to be a lot more careful," clinton said. "and that is something we have all learned."      bill clinton accuses trump of being ignorant on nafta      
__label__0 soon after donald trump’s campaign manager, kellyanne conway, said the gop nominee believes “global warming is naturally occurring,” mike pence declared “there’s no question” human activities impact the climate. “there’s no question that the activities that take place in this country and in countries around the world have some impact on the environment and some impact on climate,” pence, trump’s running mate, said tuesday on cnn. story continued below the confusion came on the heels of monday’s presidential debate, in which democratic nominee hillary clinton pointed out that trump previously said climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese. “the concept of global warming was created by and for the chinese in order to make u.s. manufacturing non-competitive,” trump wrote on twitter in 2012. trump later said it was a joke. on tuesday, pence told cnn it was “a humorous tweet” and sought to turn the argument on the democrats. “what donald trump said was a hoax is that bureaucrats in washington, d.c., can control the climate of the earth,” pence said. “and the reality is that this climate change agenda that barack obama and hillary clinton want to continue to expand is killing jobs in this country.” pence has repeatedly pledged that he and trump will end the so-called “war on coal,” a reference to obama administration policies that have led to the closures of a number of coal-fired power plants.      pence: ‘no question’ humans impact climate      
__label__0 former miss universe alicia machado on tuesday called out donald trump, saying his harsh comments about her weight have been like “a really bad dream.” machado, a hillary clinton supporter, was the featured speaker on a press call organization by the democratic nominee’s campaign, as they try to drive home the message that trump is a misogynist with a long track record of dissing women. story continued below the former beauty queen used the call to respond to trump’s attacks against her — including calling her “miss piggy” — and express her support for clinton. “i never thought 20 years later, i would be in this position, watching this guy say stupid things, make stupid comments. i never imagined that,” she said, adding, “it’s a really bad dream for me.” “my story of miss universe with this person can open eyes in this election,” she said. “he was not waiting for that—he was like oh my god, why did she pronounce the name?” she said of trump’s reaction to clinton bringing up her story. clinton on monday night accused trump of objectifying and publicly shaming women, and invoked machado in a heated moment on the debate stage. “and one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. he loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them,” clinton said. “and he called this woman miss piggy. then he called her ms. housekeeping, because she was latina. donald, she has a name.” “her name is alicia machado and she has become a u.s. citizen, and you can bet she's going to vote this november,” clinton went on to say. machado won the miss universe beauty pageant in 1996, which trump was executive producer of. machado reportedly gained 60 pounds after winning the contest, but she later said it was closer to 15. rumors surfaced that she would have to give up her title, or lose weight. trump admitted to the new york times that he pushed her to lose weight, saying, “to that, i will plead guilty.” in a 1996 interview that buzzfeed posted on tuesday, howard stern introduced the topic by saying, "the miss universe, it turns out, the woman who won last year, blows up to a fat pig. i mean, like obese," while trump can be heard laughing in the background. in the interview, trump said, "you know it was an amazing phenomenon. she weighed 118 when she won," adding, "she was as beautiful a woman as i've ever seen." he then went on to say, "she gained about 55 pounds in a period of nine months. she was like an eating machine," then quipped that she, "ate a lot of everything," when stern questioned how she could gain that much weight in that time. machado spoke of trump's comments to stern in an interview with inside edition in may. she said in the interview that trump told her she needed to lose weight and even brought her to a gym with a media crew. the republican presidential nominee praised himself in the stern interview for bringing her weight to the spotlight, saying, “it has become a major event." trump said on tuesday morning that while nothing clinton did throughout the debate to that point had managed to get under his skin, the former secretary of state’s decision to bring up machado did frustrate him. and he went on to again attack machado’s weight. “that person was a miss universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. the worst, the absolute worst. she was impossible, and she was a miss universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as miss universe,” trump said during an interview with fox news’s “fox and friends.” “she was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. we had a real problem. not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. this was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother teresa and it wasn't quite that way, but that's okay. hillary has to do what she has to do.” machado said during the press call tuesday afternoon that she was trying to forget the “abuse” after the pageant, saying she subsequently spent four years suffering from eating disorders. the former miss universe repeatedly offered her support for clinton’s presidency, saying, “i’m with mrs. clinton until the end.”      former miss universe calls trump's attacks on her weight 'a really bad dream'      
__label__0 the obama administration's latest attempt to pacify syria through diplomacy is failing in spectacularly bloody fashion, raising serious doubts among officials, analysts and others about whether pursuing more talks is worth it. but there's at least one prominent group urging the administration not to give up on negotiations. story continued below as syrian and russian forces laid waste to the northern syrian city of aleppo on tuesday, nearly 60 house democrats sent a letter to president barack obama calling on him to "persevere in this diplomatic path." "there is simply no realistic alternative to a diplomatic and political resolution of the syrian civil war that takes into account the interests of syria's diverse communities as well as the interests of all nations in a peaceful, stable middle east," states the letter, a copy of which was obtained by politico. the missive appears to try to counteract a growing sense in some corners that if the united states is serious about stopping the fighting it must put some military muscle behind its pleas to russia, the top international patron of syrian president bashar assad. the lead signatories were reps. john conyers, seth moulton and tim walz, all miiltary veterans. more than 50 u.s. officials have already called on obama to use military strikes to weaken assad and protect syrian civilians. but obama has given no indication he's open to entangling the u.s. military in another middle east war. the syrian conflict has lasted more than five years, attracting an array of groups including terrorist networks, and estimates of the dead range up to half a million. the democratic president's diplomatic team, led by secretary of state john kerry, insists it will keep pursuing negotiations with the russians despite the collapse this month of a short-lived cease-fire and extraordinary acrimony between washington and moscow at the u.n. security council. kerry pointed out to reporters monday that although the u.s. and russia are not talking "right now" — presumably a reference to just a few days of silence — russia and syria were attacking rebel-held areas in aleppo anyway. as a result, kerry is unwilling to give moscow and damascus a permanent cold shoulder. "we're still focused on a political solution," said mark toner, a state department spokesman. kerry's diplomatic dependency has led to grumbling by republicans. just last week, gop sen. john mccain of arizona, who chairs the senate armed services committee, called kerry "intrepid but delusional." sen. bob corker (r-tenn.) and rep. ed royce (r-calif.), who respectively chair the senate and house foreign affairs committees, have raised doubts about the reliability of the russians or the syrians when it comes to talks. corker said friday he was “saddened for the people of syria who are being murdered" but that "this was always to be the outcome of negotiations since russia has known all along that there was nothing to back up empty words from the united states.” there are no notable gop calls for the administration to send combat troops to syria, but royce and others have pushed obama to impose sanctions on russia for its aid to the syrian dictator. "there is no hope for diplomacy as long as assad sees a military path to victory," royce said in a statement to politico on tuesday. "imposing stiff sanctions on assad’s war machine and its enablers will allow us to push for peace from a position of strength." the house democrats' letter came about with support from left-leaning groups including the friends committee on national legislation, a quaker organization, and just foreign policy. the letter writers urge obama to think beyond syria when it comes to diplomacy, suggesting he look for peaceful ways to end the war in yemen and to resolve the conflict between the turkish government and kurdish separatists.      house dems back obama on syria despite bloodshed      
__label__0 assistant attorney general john carlin, the longest-serving head of the justice department's national security division who has overseen a flurry of high-profile terrorism and cyber espionage cases, will step down next month, officials said. mary mccord is set to replace him as acting assistant attorney general on oct. 15. story continued below carlin, 43, joined the national security division in 2009, only three years after it was established to consolidate the justice department's national security and intelligence functions, and was confirmed as head in 2014. he has overseen a robust increase in prosecutions for domestic terrorism, including the boston marathon bomber, dzhokhar tsarnaev, and steered the first conviction for attempting to construct a radiological device with the prosecution last year of glendon scott crawford, a member of the ku klux klan found guilty of planning to target unsuspecting muslim-americans with lethal doses of radiation. attorney general loretta lynch praised his pioneering role. "he oversaw the unprecedented indictment of five members of the chinese military for cyber-enabled economic espionage and the investigation of the attack on sony pictures entertainment’s computer systems," she said in a statement. "and he forged crucial collaborations with our partners in the intelligence community, law enforcement and the private sector, enhancing our collective ability to detect and deter threats as they arise.” since 2013, 110 individuals nationwide have been charged as foreign fighters for global terrorist groups, for engaging in violent extremism in the u.s. or for providing material support to the islamic state, according to the justice department. “john carlin is a dedicated public servant committed to upholding the rule of law, pursuing justice and keeping americans safe," lisa monaco, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, said in a statement. "throughout his distinguished career — most recently as assistant attorney general for national security — john has worked, largely behind the scenes, to do exactly that." carlin's division played an instrumental role earlier this year in several international computer hacking cases. su bin, a chinese national, was sentenced to 46 months after pleading guilty to working with chinese military officers to steal military technical data from u.s. defense contractors. seven iranian hackers were also indicted for working on behalf of private companies connected with iran's islamic revolutionary guard corps to deny service to the u.s. financial sector. one of the defendants was also indicted for compromising the industrial control system of the bowman dam in rye, n.y. carlin previously served as the chief of staff to then-fbi director robert mueller and was a federal prosecutor, serving as the national coordinator of the justice department’s computer hacking and intellectual property program and as an assistant u.s. attorney for the district of columbia. a justice department official said carlin was not prepared to discuss his future plans, but predicted he'd be a big draw for the private sector.      head of justice national security division to step down      
__label__0 alicia machado, the former miss universe who vaulted into the political spotlight monday night as the latest example of donald trump’s derogatory remarks about women, said the gop nominee’s wife, melania, is “a decoration” with limited english-speaking skills. in an interview with cosmopolitan magazine published tuesday, machado drew a clear line between her own immigration story and that of melania trump. both women are former models, but machado attacked melania trump for failing to do more to help those around her as the wife of a prominent political figure. story continued below “i think i speak more english than her,” machado said. “i don’t see anything about this girl. she’s a doll. she’s a decoration. that is how i see her.” donald trump was harshly critical of machado during her tenure as miss universe, calling her miss piggy and miss housekeeping, the latter a reference to her hispanic heritage. machado told cosmopolitan that those remarks triggered a relapse of her bulimia that took several years to escape. machado, who was also crowned miss venezuela, became an american citizen in august, something she told cosmopolitan she did specifically to vote against trump. tuesday morning, trump admitted that democratic nominee hillary clinton had gotten under his skin a little bit by bringing up machado at the debate. he said the pageant winner “gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem.” “that person was a miss universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. the worst, the absolute worst. she was impossible, and she was a miss universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as miss universe,” trump said on fox news’ “fox & friends.” “she was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. we had a real problem. not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. this was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother teresa, and it wasn’t quite that way, but that’s ok. hillary has to do what she has to do.”      former miss universe sizes up melania trump: 'i think i speak more english'      
__label__0 steve burke, the ceo of nbcuniversal, praised nbc nightly news anchor lester holt for his performance moderating monday night’s presidential debate between hillary clinton and donald trump. speaking at the royal television society conference in london tuesday, burke said that holt “ended up doing a very good job” moderating the debate, according to deadline. “the environment is so tough right now for anybody moderating anything to try and make sure that it’s a fair debate,” burke said, adding that he and other nbcu brass were “very worried and concerned for lester” before the debate began. burke also estimated that the contentious debate may have been watched by 100 million viewers in the u.s., according to comcast set-top box data that showed about 35% if u.s. households tuning in. holt received mixed reactions for moderating the debate between clinton and trump, during which he mostly let the candidates hash out the issues without his interference. trump initially praised holt for his performance, but by tuesday morning, he and his surrogates said that holt unfairly asked trump “hostile questions” and was not critical enough of clinton.      nbcu ceo: lester holt ‘ended up doing a very good job’ at debate      
__label__0 miami — donald trump’s aides are discussing the possibility of asking him to write his biggest check yet to his own campaign to fund an ad blitz, and the billionaire candidate is open to the possibility, according to three people close to the nominee. while trump’s campaign has experienced a surge in small-dollar fundraising this month that could make an infusion of personal cash unnecessary, major republican donors are nervous after a rocky first debate against hillary clinton and could ramp up pressure on their nominee to invest in the air war. story continued below trump’s campaign last week said that it was planning a $140-million television and digital advertising push between this week and election day, in an effort to cut into the massive advertising advantage enjoyed by clinton. but entering this month, the campaign did not have the money in the bank to pay for the effort, which would represent by far its most ambitious advertising push of the 2016 election. trump’s most recent federal election commission filing shows that his campaign had only $50 million in the bank at the end of august. since then, his small-dollar online fundraising has been especially brisk, raising the prospect that trump might not need to fund the ad buys from his own pocket — or might only need to cover part of it, according to the three people close to the candidate. they suggested that trump is amenable to either possibility — even if it means writing his biggest check of the campaign to date. trump relied heavily on his own fortune through the bitter gop primary, during which he loaned his campaign $43.5 million of his own money. a central tenet of his candidacy was that his ability to self-finance his white house bid made him independent from major donors to whom he suggested his rivals were beholden. since then, though, trump has scaled back his self-financing, giving his campaign only about $2 million a month, which he has cast as putting up his own money to match contributions from small donors. republican insiders in interviews have expressed doubt about trump’s willingness to inject larger sums of his own cash into the race. his campaign issued another monthly $2-million challenge to small donors on tuesday, promising in an email that their contributions “will be instantly matched for double the impact in our race to defeat hillary clinton.” indeed, in combination with the republican national committee, the campaign has invested heavily in a small-dollar online fundraising operation, which has produced big numbers, and has helped narrow clinton’s gaping fundraising lead. the trump campaign declined to comment on its september fundraising or how much of his own money trump was prepared to spend. one of the people close to trump said the real estate developer and reality tv star is “prepared to do whatever it takes personally to win. but the cash has been pouring in and we have a lot more cash than people think. now, there’s actually cash there to pay for the $140 million.” the person rejected a suggestion that the $140-million advertising plan was not realistic, but rather was intended to assuage worried donors and to worry clinton’s forces. “that was not a head fake,” said the person. still, trump’s team has only slowly begun investing in some of the trappings of traditional presidential campaigns, and he continues to brag about how little he’s spent relative to clinton. the democrat, trump alleged during monday’s debate has “spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue.” yet, he said, “the only gratifying thing is i saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money … i'm either winning or tied. and i’ve spent practically nothing.” in fact, trump’s campaign had spent $119 million overall through the end of august, but its advertising budget has been a fraction of that of clinton’s campaign. through the end of last week, clinton’s campaign had spent more than five times the $22 million that trump has spent on tv and radio ads for the general election, according to kantar media. and the gap appears to be widening, even as trump’s fundraising has taken off. in the 10 days leading up to the debate, clinton’s campaign aired 12,812 ads on local television in the 61 top markets, compared to 1,378 for trump, according to the tracking company media monitors. trump's planned $140-million ad buy will focus on 13 states, including battlegrounds like florida, north carolina, ohio and pennsylvania, but also maine, new mexico and wisconsin, according to an associated press report. jessica ditto, a trump campaign spokeswoman, told politico that last week it began reserving $100 million in television advertising and $40 million in digital ads, with the first $15-million-worth placed friday. “the broadcast/cable ratio will continue to fluctuate in line with targeting needs,” ditto said. ad buying data provided to politico does not reflect the full weight of the buy yet. it indicates that trump’s campaign has purchased roughly $9.8 million in advertising between tuesday and election day, compared to $41 million over that same period for clinton’s campaign.      trump considers biggest donation yet to his own campaign      
__label__0 when it comes to picking fights with republicans over cuba, barack obama has apparently decided he's only a lame-duck, second-term president once. the president announced tuesday that he has nominated jeffrey delaurentis, the top u.s. diplomat currently serving in cuba, to serve as america's official ambassador to the communist-led country. story continued below the move is sure to draw howls of protest from some hard-core opponents of the cuban government, including sens. marco rubio of florida and ted cruz of texas, who have vowed to block any ambassador nomination for cuba. still, obama's decision suggests he's willing to take on the risk of a dragged-out fight over a topic — cuba-u.s. relations — that has increasing bipartisan support. the island nation restored diplomatic ties with the u.s. in july 2015 after more than 50 years of hostility, and obama considers america's new relationship with cuba one of his signature foreign policy achievements. delaurentis is a career member of the u.s. foreign service who has been the chief of mission at the u.s. embassy in havana since it was re-established in 2015 and headed what was an american interests section there before that. he was widely believed to be the frontrunner for the ambassador's job should obama select a nominee. "the appointment of an ambassador is a common sense step forward toward a more normal and productive relationship between our two countries," obama said in a statement announcing his decision. among those appaluding obama's decision was sen. jeff flake, an arizona republican who has long advocated for better u.s.-cuba relations. "americans traveling & doing business in #cuba will be well-served by the prompt confirmation of jeff delaurentis to serve as us ambassador," flake tweeted. but although a growing number of republicans have shown support for deepening ties to cuba, it takes only a single senator to severely slow down a nomination process for an ambassador. asked by politico earlier this year whether he still held firm to his denouncement of the rapprochement with cuba and his vow to block an ambassador confirmation, rubio said yes. "a u.s. ambassador is not going to influence the cuban government, which is a dictatorial, closed regime,” the senator, who is of cuban descent, said as the one-year anniversary of cuba-u.s. ties loomed. rubio's office subsequently issued a statement assailing the nomination.

__label__0 the preliminary numbers are in, and they suggest that the first presidential debate of 2016 between hillary clinton and donald trump will be the most watched debate going back decades. with the first presidential debate of 2012 averaging 70 million viewers, last night is looking like a massive night for tv news. the numbers from all the channels will be made available by nielsen over the course of the day. all told, the early numbers continue to show that 2016 just seems to keep getting better for tv news channels. and with the presidential campaign nearing its final stretch, the first forecasts are coming in for just how good the trumped-up 2016 presidential campaign has been to them. with the 2016 election’s pivotal events delivering record ratings moments every few months (highest rated primary debate, highest rated primary election night coverage, etc), cnn and fox news are poised to have the most-watched years in their respective histories, stretching back to 1980 for cnn and 1996 for fox news. msnbc has a chance to do so as well. many networks reported that they’d “sold out” their first debate night early, and are expecting the same for the next three. story continued below and that means money. according to data from media and communications data firm snl kagan, a division of smp global market intelligence, the three major cable news networks are set to make nearly $2 billion in ad revenues, and the three main business networks are set to add another $458 million in ad revenue from just the 2016 calendar year. “we’ve been outselling our election packages for a year now,” said katrina cukaj, evp of portfolio sales & client partnerships for turner ad sales, which includes cnn. “we are close to selling out for the rest of the [election related] days; there is very high demand. very high.” fox news is expecting a “multimillion dollar revenue night” when all the money is counted. according to the wall street journal, cnn is selling debate and election night ad packages with minimums of $800,000 to $1 million, with 30 second ads for the presidential debates going for more than $55,000. other cable news channels are selling similar bundled ad packages. and those kinds of numbers take into account that there are no ad interruptions during the debate – all those ads are sold against pre- and post-game analysis and panels. “there is considerably higher demand in this election cycle with higher price points compared to the other election cycles,” an nbc source said. according to snl kagan, cnn, fox news and msnbc will combine for approximately $1.96 billion in gross ad sales in 2016. compare that to $1.72 million in calendar year 2015 (which saw a number of high-profile primary debates), and $1.56 million in calendar year 2012, the last presidential election year. the ad revenue makes sense when you look at the numbers. the first republican debate in august of 2015 brought in a record-breaking 24 million viewers for fox news. fox news’ march debate in detroit, michigan averaged just under 17 million viewers. through march and april, big primary nights would draw an average of 10-12 million viewers across cable news and on 10 p.m. broadcast specials. those sorts of ratings are typically reserved for major sporting events like nfl games, or huge hit shows like ncis. this election cycle has been delivering them with regularity, even if they are spread out across a number of channels. the election is also broadening the types of advertisers who are hoping to catch the eyeballs of the big election audiences. cukaj said she’s seen an uptick in entertainment and movie advertisements. “movie studios and entertainment has been very, very active in these big election events, they enjoy the nice big ratings these live events do,” cukaj said. fox news evp of advertising sales paul rittenberg told adweek “there's substantially more demand from [advertisers] who didn't used to buy a lot of news; we even have a beer [company].” that company is tecate, which was running a debate-specific ad about a “wall” on fox news, univision and telemundo during the pre and post-debate shows. (in fact, the wall never came up in the debate.) among the entertainment advertisers is epix, which aired a faux-cable news segment before last night’s debate, featuring cable news regulars michael steele, amy holmes and barney frank. cnn had to run a gold banner over the “segment” to ensure viewers knew it was not cnn content. for the broadcast networks, the 2016 campaign has largely been a boon, even if election-related programming has occasionally competed with or preempted more lucrative entertainment and sports programming (at $200,000 per 30 second spot, the debate programming would be very similar to what standard entertainment fare would bring in). still, this broadcast season, news programming has been one of the few bright spots, with most entertainment and sports programming seeing ratings declines compared to last year. the broadcast networks cbs and nbc are selling 30 second ads for more than $200,000 each, according to the journal. advertising rates for the presidential debates may not be as high as some primary debates were, as they do not have commercial breaks, so all ads run before and after the debate when the channels are doing pre- and post-debate analysis (in case you were wondering why there is so much of it, the answer is: inventory!) for the networks, that eats into valuable prime-time real estate, where entertainment programming can command higher premiums. there’s another reason debates like the one last night aren’t quite as valuable as they could be: scarcity, or lack thereof. with the debate airing on more than 10 tv channels, and streaming on hundreds of websites, the audience will be massive, but highly fragmented. in fact, despite the massive 2016 haul, the picture for television news continues to be bleak. for one thing, news networks these days are making less than half their money from advertising, so "big years" don't have nearly the lasting effect they might otherwise. where does the rest of their revenue come from? for big networks like cnn, a lot of it comes from “carriage fees” – the lucrative contracts the big news networks sign with cable providers like comcast, time warner cable and charter communications in return for allowing their channel to appear on the carriers’ channel line-ups. these deals – which can be contentious and result in channel blackouts with individual providers but usually, ultimately go the tv networks' way – are often negotiated in multi-year terms. time warner cfo howard averill said that next year, 2017, will deliver record profits for cnn, beating 2016 despite this year’s election boost. previously negotiated carriage fee increases guarantee that result, even if the channel sees a steep ratings decline. and that’s just one place where the connection between audience size and revenue is deteriorating. in fact, while 2016 may top the revenue charts, the three big cable news networks have actually been on the rebound since 2013, with all three increasing ad revenue every year since then. these good signs are generally taken with a grain of salt behind the closed doors of the tv businesses’ executive suites. the chief worries: television audiences are aging out of the tv news ecosystem, and not being replaced by younger viewers coveted by advertisers. over time, this will also depress audience numbers, as those aging viewers are replaced by fewer young viewers growing into engagement with tv news. and indeed, not everyone has shared in the big bounty of 2016. local ad revenue, which relies heavily on political spending, has not been as strong as anticipated. snl kagan downgraded their projected income of $3.3 billion for local television down to $3.1 billion partly as a result of trump not spending as much on advertising. sinclair broadcasting, the country’s largest owner of tv stations, warned investors last week that 2016 political ad spending was falling short of expectations. ironically, the presence of donald trump in the 2016 campaign, often discussed as if it were the reason this election is such a television draw, is a factor in that slump. “while we previously anticipated a decline in presidential ad spending in the third quarter based on the late fund-raising by the trump campaign, we have yet to see significant spending, even at the levels we initially anticipated,” sinclair cfo chris ripley said at a conference hosted by goldman sachs. cbs ceo les moonves told attendees at the same conference that his local station revenue was on track, but much of that was coming in from local and statewide races and issue campaigns. as far as the presidential campaign, there was one big reason moonves pointed to to describe the unexpected slump: “to generalize, [there is not as much spending from] the top of the tickets, because mr. trump does not appear to be spending as much as people thought.” — additional reporting by kelsey sutton      cable news’ election-year haul could reach $2.5 billion      
__label__0 despite a lack of evidence, former vermont gov. howard dean is refusing to apologize for insinuating on twitter that donald trump might be a “coke user” – instead, he claimed tuesday that the republican presidential nominee’s “grandiosity” and “delusions” are characteristic of cocaine use, while acknowledging that it’s unlikely he actually has a drug problem. as the nominees debated at hofstra university in new york on monday night, dean – a democrat who is supporting hillary clinton in the race – tweeted: “notice trump sniffing all the time. coke user?” story continued below the comment reverberated around the twittersphere – it’s been retweeted some 26,000 times – but also drew criticism for being a low blow and a conspiracy theory. msnbc’s kate snow, speaking with dean on tuesday afternoon, asked, “why did you go there?” dean, who is a physician, clarified that he was not actually assigning trump a cocaine addiction diagnosis – “you can't make a diagnosis over the television; i would never do that,” he said – but maintained that trump’s sniffling, as seen at the debate, “is actually a signature of people who use cocaine.” then he pivoted the discussion to argue that trump should release his tax returns and more detailed medical records. “he sniffs during the presentation, which is something that users do,” dean said, and then attributed a series of other characteristics to trump that he said “accompanies that problem.” he has “grandiosity,” “delusions” and “trouble with pressured speech” and “couldn't keep himself together” on monday, dean said. “i think it would be interesting to ask him and see if he ever had a problem with that.” “i just was struck by the sniffing and then by his behavior, which all sort of came together, these four symptoms,” dean continued. “you know, do i think he has a cocaine habit? i think it's unlikely that you could mount a presidential campaign at 70 years old with a cocaine habit, but it’s striking.” snow pushed back, comparing dean’s comments to theories propagated by trump surrogate rudy giuliani earlier in the race, questioning clinton’s health. “you don’t see the parallel?” she asked. “donald trump has not only not made his tax returns public, he’s also not made his medical history public in any meaningful way,” dean responded. “hillary clinton has done that and has answered any question that giuliani may want to raise.” and, dean told snow, he has no plans to apologize for the comment, or delete the tweet. “i don’t think this is a ridiculous idea. something funny was going on with trump last night. do i think it was cocaine? probably not,” he said. “this guy’s already proving himself to be unstable. the question is, why is he unstable?” republican national committee chief strategist sean spicer said on msnbc on tuesday that it was “pretty pathetic and unreal” for “someone who has been a governor, a presidential candidate and, most importantly, a medical doctor to make that prognosis with no fact.”      howard dean stands behind trump 'coke user' tweet      
__label__0 donald trump's campaign said tuesday that his campaign has pulled in $18 million in online donations in the 24 hours after monday night's debate with hillary clinton. ““as a result of donald trump’s huge debate win last night, we had a massive fundraising day bringing in more than $18 million.” the republican presidential nominee's campaign announced. story continued below the trump campaign raised $70 million in the month of august. this figure trailed clinton’s fundraising figures by $42 million. trump's touting of fundraising marks a shift from trump's primary strategy, where he touted himself as a candidate who, unlike his rivals, would not be beholden to donors. in the general election, however, trump has shattered republican records for fundraising from small donors.      trump reports $18 million post-debate fundraising haul

__label__0 senate armed services committee chairman john mccain will vote to override president barack obama’s veto of legislation that would allow families of the victims of the sept. 11, 2001 attacks to sue saudi arabia — defying warnings from military officials that it could put u.s. troops at risk. mccain’s decision to back the justice against sponsors of terrorism act is also a notable break from his usual hawkish allies on the capitol. house armed services committee chairman mac thornberry of texas has circulated a letter urging republicans to sustain obama’s veto, while close friend sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.) has also voiced concerns and worked behind the scenes on potential tweaks to the bill — but with little success. story continued below “i plan to vote to override the president’s veto of the justice against sponsors of terrorism act,” mccain said in a statement to politico. “going forward, i will continue to work with my colleagues in the senate to ensure that american military, intelligence, and diplomatic personnel are protected from any potential retaliatory lawsuits and that the implementation of this law is true to its narrow intent.” earlier tuesday, mccain had declined to say where he could come down on the jasta vote scheduled in the senate for wednesday, noting: “i have got to look at what the alternatives are.” mccain’s statement adds to the air of inevitability on capitol hill surrounding the 9/11 bill, which was formally vetoed by obama last week but is expected to easily clinch the two-thirds support from congress needed to override a presidential veto. it would be obama’s first veto successfully overridden by congress. still, top obama administration officials have tried to exert last-minute pressure on lawmakers to help sustain obama’s veto. for instance, secretary of state john kerry has had several conversations with senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker (r-tenn.), who has been one of the senators most skeptical of the bill. gen. joe dunford, the top u.s. military official, weighed in tuesday with a letter, obtained by politico, outlining his concerns for u.s. service members and “risks to the close security cooperation relationships” with allies. and defense secretary ash carter fired off another warning to congress, arguing that legislation has “potentially harmful consequences for the department of defense and its personnel.” "while we are sympathetic to the intent of jasta, its potential second- and third-order consequences could be devastating to the department and its service members and could undermine our important counterterrorism efforts abroad," carter wrote in the letter, obtained by politico. on tuesday, mccain’s democratic counterpart on the armed services committee, sen. jack reed of rhode island, acknowledged the administration's concerns. “i’m looking closely at two significant issues,” reed said. “one is that the families are looking not for any type of award, they’re looking for accountability as much as anything else. on the other side, is the real possibility this will be used against us and our troops and servicemen, and i’m trying to balance that.” mccain’s democratic opponent, rep. ann kirkpatrick, also plans to vote to override obama’s veto, she said in a statement earlier this month. kirkpatrick’s campaign has also raised saudi arabia as a campaign issue. as the senate debated a vote to block a saudi arms sale last week, her campaign accused mccain of having ties to the saudi government through a donation to the mccain institute. even lawmakers who have voiced concerns say there is little question the senate is set to easily override obama’s veto. corker and graham had started to discuss a potential change to the legislation that would narrow its scope to just the families of the victims of the sept. 11, 2001 attacks, according to congressional sources. right now, jasta applies to any foreign government found liable for terrorism conducted on u.s. soil – although the main target of the legislation has largely been viewed as saudi arabia and its alleged role in the terror attacks 15 years ago. fifteen of the 19 hijackers were saudi nationals. speaking with reporters, corker said limiting jasta to just sept. 11 victims was the “easiest” way to narrow the legislation, but it was still facing opposition from jasta supporters. he predicted that lawmakers may push to pass a legislative fix to the 9/11 bill in the lame-duck session, after observing any potential “blowback” the united states ends up facing from foreign governments over the next several weeks. “this isn’t to me about saudi arabia,” corker said. “it’s the blowback to us because we’re the most involved in the world. you end up exporting your foreign policy to trial lawyers, right? … what you’re really doing here is potentially exporting big issues to trial lawyers away from our own abilities as a government to conduct foreign policy. that’s an issue.” though the veto override appears like a done deal, there was a clear and palpable sense of buyer’s remorse percolating among key lawmakers as the senate barreled toward the key vote on wednesday. sen. orrin hatch (r-utah), a senior member of the senate judiciary committee, noted that he himself was a co-sponsor of jasta. still, that wasn’t stopping him from having second thoughts as the prospect of the legislation turning into law became a reality. “i’m worried about getting into a tremendous legal morass that can really cost this country, not just locally but by other countries across the world,” hatch said. “i have to say, i don’t think we had enough time to consider all the ramifications. there are a lot of ramifications.” sen. dianne feinstein (d-calif.), the top democrat on the senate intelligence committee, also reiterated her concerns: “the more i think from an intelligence perspective, it’s the wrong thing to do.” still, other senators appeared to have little change of heart ahead of the high-profile vote on wednesday. “the vote passed overwhelmingly here in the senate and the house,” said sen. deb fischer (r-neb.). “i supported it at the time. i haven’t seen anything that would change my mind.”      mccain will vote to override veto of 9/11 bill      
__label__0 in front of the largest televised debate audience ever, donald trump blew it. swing-state republicans expressed frustration at his monday night performance, characterizing it as a series of missed opportunities to move the dial in the places that will matter most to his electoral fortunes in november. story continued below name-checking battleground states like michigan and ohio was a wise move, state and local gop leaders said. and trump’s message on trade resonates in industrial areas across the rust belt, from pennsylvania to wisconsin. but above all else, republican officials and operatives lamented his lack of preparation and failure to reach persuadable voters, especially women and gop-leaners who are not yet sold on him. instead of prosecuting the case against hillary clinton — which would have helped accelerate the consolidation of the gop base in states like pennsylvania where once-reticent republicans are beginning to fall in line behind the nominee — trump got bogged down defending controversial decisions he’s made, from championing birtherism to making insensitive comments about women. “i think trump should have been better prepared,” said alan novak, a former pennsylvania republican party chairman. “her preparation, strategically, helped her control the flow of that debate. it was like a basketball game when the pace is dictated by one team. she clearly did that. his focus was on himself, explaining too much about him. the opportunity was missed to go after vulnerable points on her.” “he started out having a little bit of a better [performance] than what i was anticipating, on trade issues i believe he had her back on her heels in the very first part,” said a veteran north carolina republican strategist, working on several races in the state. “there were a lot of opportunities, when they got into discussing cybersecurity, to inject emails, the whole narrative of her carelessness, national security matters and all that. it was a missed opportunity by trump that comes from a lack of being prepared.” in interviews with more than a dozen battleground state republican leaders, there was widespread agreement that trump’s core supporters would continue to stand by him, and that the election would remain close in their states — they characterized the debate as a failure to accomplish what he needed to, rather than a costly debacle. “trump had the opportunity to raise questions about her emails, to raise questions about the clinton foundation, to raise questions about benghazi, to raise questions about a host of other things, and he simply failed to do it,” said charlie gerow, a gop strategist based in pennsylvania. while trump surrogates criticized moderator lester holt after the debate, “the burden was on him to do that,” said gerow of trump. the gop nominee started the debate off strong, many republicans agreed, initially pushing a message of change and a successful attack on trade policy. but he was repeatedly drawn into protracted fights that didn’t advance his interests, and his lack of policy command was apparent. trump’s approach to national security and foreign policy was a particular sticking point with bill urbanski, a former gop chair of northeastern pennsylvania’s luzerne county, who said he was bothered by trump’s seemingly contradictory response to a question about whether the u.s. should embrace a no-first-use nuclear weapons policy. “trump was just nowhere near actually being responsive to the question that was posed,” he said. “i guess it could mean two things: one could be…trying to dodge the question because he was trying to make a particular point, but the way i read that was, he didn’t have an answer to that question.” the end result: republican-leaners like urbanski still see no reason to rally to him, raising questions about whether trump will be able to hit the level of party support achieved by mitt romney in pennsylvania in 2012. “man, it continues to trouble me,” said urbanski, who said he would like to back trump and can’t stomach voting for clinton. “this guy is not qualified for this job. he presents himself that way every time i see him. i can’t get over that hurdle.” added gerow, “my sense is, no minds were changed last night among those who had cemented their views…but among the 8, 10, 12, 15 percent who are still genuinely persuadable, i think last night slowed down, if not halted, trump’s momentum. that’s, i think, the problem. he’s got to try to regain momentum. he has to get back on offense.” while there are still two debates to go, there won’t be many better chances to win over undecided voters, convince fence-sitting republicans or energize the base. in ohio’s warren county, party regulars were primed for the first showdown between clinton and trump, hoping to see him stick it to clinton at a local gop watch party. “we had folks from the statewide and national party, we had local party folks and then we had trump campaigners, and we had citizens at large,” said jeff monroe, the warren county gop chairman. “they were totally into it and all jazzed up, more so than i anticipated. the energy level in the room was significantly better than i anticipated.” but when asked for trump’s strongest moments in the debate, monroe explained his impression this way. “it’s more along the lines that there wasn’t anything catastrophic that would change the outcome,” he said. “i think that what we saw was that he was doing his very best to distinguish himself from both political sets. he was taking that approach,” monroe said. “i think that’s going to play well with a lot of the folks that are supporting him. regardless of whether or not, as the pundits have pointed out, there was some slippage later on, he distinguished himself.” florida’s republican national committeeman, peter feaman, similarly said he couldn’t think of a “high or low point” for trump in the debate. but he said trump did accomplish one important task: he proved he could appear presidential, addressing a weakness that has dogged him among some republicans in the swing state with the largest haul of electoral votes. “it was pretty plain. i don’t think it contained what a lot of the viewers were hoping to see, which were fireworks. that wasn’t the goal at this point,” he said. trump certainly didn’t deliver anything to persuade sandra kase, who serves on the kingston municipal council in luzerne county. a lifelong republican who says she cannot vote for clinton, kase said trump allowed the democratic nominee to bait him, raising questions about his judgment and his ability to control his temper with world leaders. equally worrisome, the gop nominee failed to make strides toward winning over women like kase in a state where clinton holds a 14-point edge of trump among likely women voters, according to a new cnn/orc poll. “just his attitude toward women, sexism, everything that comes out of his mouth turns me off. i’m sorry, i can’t say a good thing about him,” she said. “just the whole atmosphere of the debate, his whole attitude, his reaction — i don’t think he has the temperament. as soon as someone goads him into something, he blasts out what we wants to say and feels that’s ok, and it’s not.”      swing-state republicans dump on trump      
__label__0 a pilot who ferried gop vice presidential nominee mike pence, his family, staff, secret service contingent and traveling press has been fired following revelations that he faces criminal charges for intentionally hitting a man with his car. the pilot, vincent caldara, is a former police officer and chairman of trump's florida law enforcement coalition. the news of caldara’s criminal charges was first reported by the guardian in an article on potential criminal activities of some of those in law enforcement supporting trump. story continued below “i’m a very strong trump supporter, i’m a retired law enforcement officer, and i’m currently on governor mike pence’s flight operations team as one of his pilots during the campaign,” caldara told a crowd at the opening of a trump campaign office in brevard county in early september. “donald trump and governor mike pence are the law and order candidates.” pence’s camp distanced itself from caldara: “all of our pilots are assigned by the airline,” pence spokesman marc lotter told politico. caldara “is not and has not been” a paid staffer for the campaign at the state or national level, lotter added. he referred questions about any volunteer role caldara has to trump’s florida campaign, which did not respond to a request for comment. “he is no longer employed at eastern air lines,” said nick loudon, executive director of special projects at eastern airlines, the private charter company that flies pence. he said he could not comment further due to “legal considerations.” caldara had not flown the pence plane for several weeks before the news of his assault charge broke. caldara, 55, is charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon after allegedly striking a friend with his vehicle “three times, against his will, causing back and leg injuries,” in july 2015, according to court documents. the two had been in argument, and the victim, whose name is withheld, “stood in front of caldara’s vehicle as caldara attempted to leave.” the police report stated that, according to the victim, “caldara started the vehicle and then drove forward, bumping him with the front bumper of the vehicle…caldara then drove forward again, striking [the victim] with the front bumper of the vehicle, knocking him to the ground. [the victim] advised he fell to his knees and was struck again by caldara’s vehicle, knocking him down again. [the victim] stated he crawled out from under the vehicle and then caldara drove off.” caldara has pleaded not guilty. caldara is also being sued by a woman who alleges that caldara hit her with his motorcycle in 2014, “seriously and severely” injuring her, according to court documents. the complaint alleges that caldara was driving “carelessly and negligently” when he struck the victim. caldara’s twitter account, which appears to have been deleted, listed him as “chairman of the florida law enforcement coalition to elect donald j. trump for president.”      pence charter pilot fired, facing assault charges      
__label__0 new york — wall street rallied on tuesday as investors appeared to cheer hillary clinton’s strong performance in the first presidential debate and rest a bit easier about the prospect of donald trump winning the white house. u.s. stock futures rose sharply immediately following the debate, which most pundits and surveys suggested the democratic nominee won handily. the mexican peso soared. the currency tends to drop as trump’s chances rise, with investors betting on the gop nominee making good on his promise of new trade tariffs. stocks continued to climb during the day, with the dow jones industrial average up 133 points, though some of that was in response to a very strong consumer confidence number. story continued below market analysts say positive reaction to the debate is not because wall street adores clinton or her policies on taxes and spending. instead it’s that many do not know what to expect from a trump presidency and fear the impact of new protectionist trade policies and possibly unpredictable foreign relations. wall street’s biggest fear is uncertainty. “we’re seeing a bit of a ‘relief rally’ today. equity markets are higher, and the peso, one key anti-trump barometer, has rebounded from its multi-year low hit yesterday,” said jack ablin, chief market strategist at bmo private bank. “investors assumed that trump would cement a lead from the debate, but hillary stayed on message, donald did not.” thus far in 2016, markets have not shown very strong reactions to the ebbs and flows of the campaign, as many investors assumed a clinton win. most of wall street focused on the federal reserve over the past several weeks, wondering whether it would raise interest rates at its september meeting. but with that meeting now past, and the fed still on hold, investors and traders are paying closer attention to the 2016 race and taking the prospect of a trump win more seriously, greeting news of his rise in the polls with bouts of selling. “there was certainly a reaction in the futures, and that was clearly related to the debate,” said jim paulsen of wells capital management. “traders clearly decided before the debate that a trump win would be bad and a clinton win would be good.” but paulsen cautioned not to read too much into tuesday’s market action. “overall, there’s not much evidence of a big election impact on the markets, because there has been so much else going on with global growth, earnings and the fed.” one area where a 2016 effect clearly shows up is in the currency markets, particularly the peso versus the u.s. dollar. the peso plunged 8 percent in the three weeks leading up to monday night’s debate as trump rose in the polls to a virtual deadlock with clinton. after the debate, the peso rallied over 2 percent against the dollar, suggesting investors viewed clinton as the winner. trump continued his attack on mexico as an unfair trading partner during the debate and once again ripped the north american free trade agreement as a disaster and the worst trade deal in history. “our jobs are fleeing the country. they’re going to mexico. they’re going to many other countries,” trump said at the outset of the debate. “the nafta agreement is defective. just because of the tax and many other reasons.” trump also again threatened new taxes on mexican imports, something that could lead to fewer exports from the country and thus a weaker economy and currency. clinton, by contrast, is viewed by many on wall street as generally favorable toward trade — despite her avowed skepticism about the trans-pacific partnership — and unlikely to unleash new protectionist policies. so when clinton does well, markets tend to rise along with the peso. “most people viewed hillary as the winner of that debate, and markets clearly want hillary to win rather than trump; you can tell that from the way it trades,” said steve massocca, managing director at wedbush securities in san francisco. “people are very concerned about trump’s trade policies being bad for the economy, and then there is the crazy factor. he comes across as having an irresponsible attitude at times and thin skin that would make him more reactionary than a president would ordinarily be.” massocca and others noted that while wall street does not look favorably on all of clinton’s proposed tax increases — especially on the wealthy — she is a very well-known quantity, having been in public life for decades, including as a senator from new york. she has also raised millions of dollars from wall street and given highly paid speeches to goldman sachs and other banking groups. in addition, many big investors believe clinton will likely be constrained by at least one side of capitol hill as president. that would mean more of the same kind of economic policies seen since divided government began after the 2010 midterm elections. “somewhere along the way, everyone decided clinton meant stability and trump meant volatility and uncertainty,” said paulsen. “and if it’s clinton, there won’t be all that much she can do and it will be like obama for the last six years.” trump has also spooked some investors by referring to the current market as a “big, fat, ugly bubble” and suggesting it is going to burst in the near future. he has also taken the unusual step of publicly and repeatedly criticizing federal reserve chair janet yellen, something presidential candidates and presidents generally stay away from, given that the central bank is supposed to be largely insulated from the daily grind of partisan politics. the fear is that as president, trump could be extraordinarily involved in monetary policy, possibly damaging both the economy and financial markets. trump supporters argue that his presidency would actually be very good for stocks and the economy, with large tax cuts for corporations and individuals and a reduction in regulations that businesses often complain choke off stronger growth. he’s also pledged to bring back the more than $2 trillion in cash u.s. companies currently have overseas while spending hundreds of billions on infrastructure, all of which could be stimulative to the economy and good for stock prices. trump tried to make that case in the debate on monday night. “my tax cut is the biggest since ronald reagan,” he said. “i’m very proud of it. it will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. but regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence,” he said to clinton. “i’m really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs. they’re going to expand their companies. they’re going to do a tremendous job.”      wall street stages pro-clinton 'relief rally'

__label__0 fbi director james comey warned tuesday that the increasing success of the military campaign against the islamic state in syria and iraq carries an ominous downside: a wave of terrorist fighters who will spread across the globe as the group loses control of its territory on the ground. "the so-called caliphate will be crushed. the challenge will be: through the fingers of that crush are going to come hundreds of very, very dangerous people," comey said at a senate homeland security committee hearing on the global terror threat. "they will not all die on the battlefield in syria and iraq. there will be a terrorist diaspora sometime in the next two to five years like we've never seen before." story continued below "we must prepare ourselves and our allies particularly in western europe to confront that threat because when isil is reduced to an insurgency and those killers flow out they will try to come to western europe and try to come here to kill innocent people," the fbi director said. he said the wave of fighters will be larger than the one that came out of afghanistan after the war there in the 1980s. committee chairman sen. ron johnson (r-wis.) acknowledged that the territory governed by isil has decreased, but he said the campaign against the group has been so slow that the group is reconstituting elsewhere. "we haven’t reduced their capability. the diaspora has already begun," johnson said. "we're poking the hive. we've done some damage to it but the killer bees are leaving the hive. they’re setting up new hives." national counterterrorism center director nicholas rasmussen said intelligence officials had long predicted the threat would metastasize as isil was squeezed. "it’s not surprising. it puts us in a period of sustained vulnerability that i don’t think any of us are comfortable with. but i think it’s a reality," he said. despite the fears of terrorist fighters flowing out of iraq and syria, some senators said a more urgent worry is that the fbi is missing opportunities to head off home-grown terrorist attacks like the shooting at an orlando nightclub in june where 49 people were killed and the bombings earlier this month in new york and new jersey. sens. rand paul (r-ky.) and kelly ayotte (r-n.h.) noted that fbi investigators looked at the suspects in those attacks long before the violence, but closed those inquiries without bringing charges. "i'm also troubled the fbi is not even willing to admit they made some mistakes," paul complained. "these are judgment calls and the judgment calls were incorrect and i think we should just admit that and look at some of the facts." paul said the fbi failed to get video from a gun shop that could have shown shooter omar mateen buying a weapon shortly before the attack, but comey said the fbi wasn't told about that visit promptly and by the time it was notified the video was already erased. however, paul said the fbi should have kept an investigation into mateen open longer because it might have exposed his plan to attack the pulse nightclub. comey said the fbi can keep such probes open indefinitely and repeatedly extended the one in florida. "we should keep them open longer...as long as the facts warrant," the fbi director said. "we have the policies and the tools we need to do this well." he added that agents have to make a "judgement every day" about whether specific cases merit further investigation. ayotte questioned why agents handling the pre-shooting investigation of mateen never looked at his social media or internet activity, even the publicly available information. comey said the fbi had two people interacting directly with mateen, leading the case agent to think he had "a pretty good vector into [mateen's] state of mind." ayotte said it still seemed odd that the fbi wouldn't also check his public online activity, especially as the fbi presses for more access to encrypted communications. "it just seems surprising to me that there wasn’t some kind of online work done in something so significant," the new hampshire republican said. comey said a review of the florida probe is nearly done and another is in the works. he also said an assessment will be done of the handling of earlier inquiries into new york and new jersey bombing suspect ahmad rahami, but that inquiry will be complicated by the pending prosecutions of the suspect who is currently in a newark hospital being treated for a gunshot wound. "we are going to go back," the fbi director said. "you will find us being very candid about our shortcomings and our strengths."      comey warns of post-isil terrorist 'diaspora'      
__label__0 the democratic senatorial campaign committee now plans to spend at least $5 million in indiana, a media-tracking source confirmed tuesday, as democrat evan bayh’s once-dominant lead over republican todd young has narrowed rapidly in the race considered a key part of democrats’ strategy to take the senate majority. the senate democrats’ campaign arm initially planned to spend $2.5 million supporting bayh in indiana as part of their broader strategy to bolster spending in traditionally conservative-leaning states such as north carolina. but the dscc has since doubled their ad reservations in indiana. story continued below “we expanded the map this year into states like indiana where we can pick up an open republican-held seat and further put the gop on defense as they struggle to keep their hold on their majority,” a democratic official said. meanwhile, senate majority pac — the super pac dedicated to electing democrats to the senate — is adding an additional $1 million to their initial spending, bring its total ad reservation to $1.7 million in indiana, a spokesman said. bayh, who announced in july that he would make a last-minute comeback bid, has led in the limited public polling so far. but bayh began his run with internal polling that showed him leading young by more than 20 points. the most recent poll in the race, conducted by wthr/howey politics earlier this month, shows bayh with a four-point lead over young.      senate dems add another $2.5 million in bayh's indiana race      
__label__0 as he made clear once again in monday night’s debate, donald trump sees the world in zero-sum terms—when one person or one country wins, another always loses. asked by nbc’s lester holt how to help american workers, trump responded in his usual way, saying america was getting beaten by everyone else around the world, and the nafta free-trade deal was “one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. ... we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.” hillary clinton, by contrast, sees the world as a place where all boats can rise at once—as she also made plain monday by harking back to bill clinton’s pro-globalization presidency, which included nafta. ‘i think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. i think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again,” she said. “incomes went up for everybody.” story continued below that is the election of 2016 distilled down to its essence. “my whole life is about winning. … i always win,” trump says in explaining why he’s running. the economic plan on his website begins with the rubric “winning the global competition.” you don’t get more zero-sum than that. despite the view of most economists that the economy overall is not a zero-sum game—but rather a complex mechanism that, if run right, can raise everyone’s welfare at once–trump’s message has resonated in an era when it’s become common to speak of winners and losers in the global economy. the zero-sum message fits neatly with the widespread reality that many millions have been severely harmed by the transitions in our economy over the past decades. as danny vinik recently noted in politico, the gap between those who are thriving in the new economies of today and those who are not continues to grow. the recent census report that showed a 5.2 percent increase in real median income between 2014 and 2015 was taken by many as proof that the narrative of an america in decline and losing is fundamentally flawed. statistically, if the united states is one unit, that is true. but 320 million people have a huge variety of experiences ill-suited to one size fit all numbers, and while the averages and medians may go up or down, that says nothing about the lived experience of tens of millions who diverge from that one number. and the experience of a goodly portion of what was the industrial heartland and what was the epicenter of the mid-2000s housing bubble is unequivocally negative, insecure and economically grim. hence, you have the sense that those who perceive themselves as winners in the global economy are trending towards the democrats, while those who think they’ve lost are going toward trump. there is some truth there, but that isn’t a sufficient explanation for why, for instance, massive percentages of african-americans and latinos, who have certainly struggled economically and socially, support clinton. no, what is most striking about this election is the degree to which the electorate is polarized not between winners and losers per se but between those who view the world in such zero-sum terms, like trump, and those who sense that it is possible to multiply the numbers of “winners” without creating a commensurate number of losers. that has been the mantra of clinton and her predecessors in the democratic party, and it was also the foundation of ronald reagan’s appeal. the belief that the economic pie can expand year after year and embrace ever more people has also backed up by a generation of economists who argue that open trade and globalization makes the whole world wealthier. hillary clinton has continued to deliver that message. at the democratic convention in july she spoke of an america thriving with economic opportunity, with millions working hard and succeeding. president obama has also been at pains to highlight the innovations of silicon valley, the revival of many cities in the past decade, and the substantial gains on the other side of 2008-2009 financial crisis. judging from polls and surveys, those who fit that description – clustered and concentrated in large metro areas, and on the coasts especially – support clinton and the democrats by wide margins. *** is either side right? most economists see the liberal internationalist order backed by the law establishing the rules of engagement in free markets as a key element to the emergence of a several billion-strong global middle class. in general, that view is correct. but it still tends to gloss over just how wrenching it is to be among the tens of millions in the united states caught in the vortex of rapid change. it does these global laggards no good to say that they have bigger homes and longer lives and more possessions than their grandparents. they legitimately fear that they will lose those homes, be unable to afford healthcare, that they will see their communities crumble and their children’s hopes extinguished. and they see a world of others who appear to be doing better, who seem to be winning, and a political establishment that has promised everything and delivered what feels like nothing. the voice of the so-called losers in this global competition is as loud, politically speaking, as it’s been in a long time. hence trump (not to mention bernie sanders’ powerful insurgency in the democratic primaries). the last time so many in the united states were so sour about the inequities between those winning (the few) and those losing was at the dawn of the progressive movement in the 1890s. many early progressives rebelled against an elite vision of social darwinism then prevalent which said that the strong and the best thrive while the rest manage to eke out what they can. in 1896, the scion of that view was william jennings bryan, who painted a picture of the united states every bit as bleak and dark as trump with his thundering about elites on the coasts crucifying hard worker labor and farmers on a “cross of gold.” bryan lost two elections, and his zero-sum view never came to dominate american politics. much of his message about inequality and the need to reform the system, however, was taken up by theodore roosevelt and generations of both republicans and democrats. some of it harsh and redistributive, focused on trust busting and exerting american influence and prestige abroad, and much of it was about expanding opportunities for all. trump also enjoys a good deal of sub-rosa support among business leaders and wall street, who certainly haven’t lack for economic benefits in today’s world. they aren’t supporting him with their money, but many of them detest clinton and see trump as expressing their world view. for wall street, that makes some sense, in that in the wake of the financial crisis, key aspects of finance are becoming less popular and less profitable. in that sense, finance, which was the winning sector of the economy from the mid-1980s through the mid-2000s, has been losing ground. the idea of gain and loss, and that every trade represents a winner and a loser, is deeply embedded in aspects of wall street. we have, of course, no idea which candidate and which worldview will prevail in six weeks. but if trump wins, he should remember: it is impossible to find any society and any point in american history where a zero-sum formula has led to increased affluence for the many and increased security. zero-sum most often begets zero-sum, whether in the form of trade wars or actual wars. by contrast, the profound strength of the united states has been a vision of an open economy that thrives on education and innovation and an open world where the strength invariably overcomes the zero-sum countries and alliances that pepper the planet and always have. a vision of winners and losers invariably begets more winners and losers, and little else.      trump vs. clinton: a fundamental clash over how the economy works      
__label__0 for the first time in its 126-year history, the arizona republic has endorsed a democratic candidate for president. the paper's editorial board said hillary clinton is "the only choice to move america ahead." "since the arizona republic began publication in 1890, we have never endorsed a democrat over a republican for president. never. this reflects a deep philosophical appreciation for conservative ideals and republican principles," the paper's editorial board wrote. "this year is different." the editorial said clinton's temperament and experience prepare her for office, while it questioned donald trump for not releasing his tax returns, asking "whose hand do you want on the nuclear button?" clinton has racked up her fair share of nontraditional endorsements from newspapers. last week, the cincinnati enquirer, which noted it had backed republican candidates for president “for almost a century," also endorsed clinton. earlier this month, the dallas morning news endorsed the former secretary of state, making her the first democrat that newspaper has endorsed in over 75 years.      the arizona republic endorses hillary clinton      
__label__0 shimon peres, whose public career spanned the entire history of the state of israel, reaching the highest of highs (the oslo accord) and the lowest of lows (the assassination of his close colleague yitzhak rabin) in the mid-1990s, has died. peres, who suffered a stroke sept. 13, was 93. the jerusalem post said he "suffered severe organ failure tuesday." story continued below peres and rabin shared a nobel peace prize in 1994 with palestinian leader yasser arafat “for their efforts to create peace in the middle east.” their attempt, backed by president bill clinton, at solving the seemingly intractable israeli-palestinian conflict was the biggest breakthrough in the region since the israel-egypt accords of 1978 and offered, for a time, hope for better days. peres, who began his public life in israel under founding prime minister david ben-gurion, was twice israel’s prime minister, in 1984-86 and 1995-96; he was also unofficially the prime minister in 1977. the 1995-96 stint had a tragic air to it — it followed rabin’s slaying by an israeli radical and was marked by palestinian terrorism that, coupled with the assassination, halted momentum toward peace with the palestinians. connected to every major leader in israeli history, peres served in important government positions over eight decades, finally ending up in 2007 as president. he also had deep connections with the american jewish community and u.s. political leaders. in 2012, president barack obama presented him with the presidential medal of freedom. “no individual has done so much over so many years to build our alliance and to bring our two nations closer,” obama said. added obama: “shimon peres — born in a shtetl in what was then poland, who rose to become president of israel — he is a dreamer. and rightly so. for he knows what we must never forget: with faith in ourselves and courage in our hearts, no dream is too big, no vision is beyond our reach.” peres was born shimon persky on aug. 16, 1923, in wiszniew, poland (now part of belarus). among his relations: a perske family in new york city that would yield betty jane perske (born 1924), who achieved enduring fame as the actress lauren bacall. under the sway of theodor herzl’s zionist philosophy, his family emigrated to palestine in 1934. “to us,” peres wrote in "the imaginary voyage," his 2000 book about him, “herzl was an exceptional person, a kind of prince in exile or a king without a crown who had pointed out the route his people should follow.” in 1942, the remaining jews in peres’ hometown, including his grandfather, were exterminated by the nazis. peres lived on a kibbutz and, in 1945, he married sonia gelman. in 1947, peres joined the haganah, which had been formed as a zionist self-defense organization and was now at the forefront of jewish efforts to prepare for the inevitable fight for statehood. the united nations approved a resolution calling for the partition of palestine into two states in november 1947, and ben-gurion proclaimed israel’s independence in may 1948. war followed, and israel emerged from it a nation. ben-gurion appointed peres director of naval services in 1948. “david ben-gurion was a mythic figure, the founding father of israel and a modern-day prophet, but he was also a real man who stormed through history on human legs,” wrote peres in his 2011 biography of his mentor. “it was my great privilege to know him and work with him for many years.” peres served the young nation in just about every way imaginable, including a stint representing the defense ministry in the united states. he served in the knesset (parliament) from 1959, and also as leader or deputy leader of defense, immigrant absorption, finance, information, and transport and communication. a hawk on defense, peres was known for his efforts to improve israeli forces. in july 1976, he was rabin’s defense minister when israel launched a daring raid to rescue hostages held at entebbe airport in uganda. rabin was soon hit by a financial scandal, and peres unofficially replaced him until elections could be held. in may 1977, peres led the labor coalition to its first-ever defeat, losing to menachem begin’s likud party. it was a setback that was to be repeated: for all his accomplishments, peres couldn’t win over israel’s voters. “he comes across,” wrote marcus eliason for the associated press in 1980, “as a technocrat, as much at home with the silicon chip as with french literature. technology fascinates him, be it the atomic bomb or the zip code.” after begin defeated him again in 1981, peres took on begin’s successor, yitzhak shamir, in 1984. this time, neither coalition was able to secure a majority, so a unity government was formed, with peres serving the first 25 months as prime minister and the next 25 as shamir’s vice premier/foreign minister. as prime minister, peres withdrew israeli forces from lebanon and improved relations with morocco and egypt. as foreign minister in 1987, he negotiated a secret peace deal with jordan’s king hussein that was designed to pave the way for palestinian talks. that agreement was scuttled by shamir, who then secured his hold on the prime minister’s job in 1988. in 1992, a revitalized rabin was elected prime minister. peres became his foreign minister, and secret talks with palestinians began at an isolated farmhouse in norway. the associated press later reported “only 10 people in israel knew that one of the middle east’s most enduring taboos had been broken: israel was talking to the plo.” a breakthrough came in august 1993, followed by a sept. 13 ceremony on the white house lawn where rabin and arafat shook hands in front of clinton. ”the signing of the israel-plo accord is more than a political milestone,” peres wrote in tikkun magazine. “it is a transformative event which touches every jewish family — physically, emotionally, spiritually.” some jews feared the oslo accord would lead to the destruction of israel; their objections were mirrored among those arabs who adamantly rejected israel’s right to exist. but things seemed to be on track as the deals were followed by further agreements, as well as a landmark treaty with jordan. then came rabin’s assassination by radical jewish right-winger yigal amir on nov. 4, 1995, and israeli society was turned upside down. according to the book "murder in the name of god" by michael karpin and ina friedman, amir and his fellow plotters considered whether peres should be killed along with rabin. the decision, however, was made for amir: as a giant peace rally in tel aviv ended, the two leaders left separately. karpin and friedman described the moment: “as yigal amir sat on the concrete flower pot in the parking area, shimon peres descended the steps beside him. amir noticed there was only one bodyguard with him and no policemen. yigal’s arm moved to act, but he held back. peres’s bodyguard cast a suspicious glance at him. ‘for god’s sake, what’s that dark guy doing down there? is he one of us?’ the bodyguard whispered into his tiny microphone.” shortly thereafter, rabin exited and was gunned down by amir. as israel went into a period of mourning, debate and pained soul-searching, peres became prime minister again. “i shared with him days of worry and grief,” peres said of rabin in addressing a joint session of congress in december 1995. “i shared with him hours of reflection and decision. we complemented each other in a determined pursuit of the only objective worthy of the task bestowed upon us by the people of israel: to carve a new era of security in peace, to build bridges across an arab-israeli divide, an impossible divide. and he, the captain, is no more.” months later, peres was ousted. he had confidently called for new elections, only to see his standing in the polls badly damaged by a rise in palestinian terror attacks. buoyed by opposition to oslo, benjamin netanyahu prevailed in elections in may 1996. as would-be peace partners, netanyahu and arafat were mismatched and distrustful. the promise of 1993 disintegrated. after the electoral rebuke, peres remained on israel’s public stage. in 1996, he founded the peres center for peace, an organization designed to promote peace with israel’s neighbors, as well as between jews and arabs within israel. he served as president from 2007 until his retirement in july 2014. even after his retirement, he remained an advocate for finding a peaceful solution. "the alternative to two states is a continued war," he told the associated press in november 2015, "and nobody can maintain a war forever. if you say we should live on our sword don't forget that there are other swords as well." in august 2016, at the age of 93, he announced he had joined snapchat. "today all the young people are on snapchat, and i am happy to be there with them," peres said in explaining that he always wanted to stay on the cutting edge of technology. in 1996, peres and king hussein were awarded the annual liberty medal in philadelphia for their peace efforts. in 2008, peres received an honorary knighthood from queen elizabeth ii. in 2013, clinton saluted him for his 90th birthday: “you are the world’s social einstein. you have tried to put together a unified theory of meaning to unite politics and philosophy and psychology and history and science and technology. every one of us who has been blessed enough to know you … has been made a little bigger, a little stronger and a little more optimistic that one day your theory will be real,” he told peres in jerusalem, according to haaretz. “when i was a child, israel was a legend more than a reality,” peres said at that gala. “she emerged from a dream, and today she has surpassed that dream.” peres’ wife, sonia, died in 2011; the couple had three children.      shimon peres, israeli leader for 8 decades, dies at 93      
__label__1 as far as terrorism is concerned, yesterday was a good and a bad day for americans. in addition to a knife wielding allah chanting attacker in a minnesota mall, who injured 7 before being shot dead by an off duty police officer, there was an undetonated bomb found in seaside park in nj and 2 bombs found in the chelsea neighborhood of manhattan, one undetonated and one detonated, which injured 29 people. at this juncture, police are saying that all three devices appear to have been made by the same person. it was a good day in that no intended victims died. and it was a bad day in that these incidents expose how vulnerable americans are to these kinds of attacks, especially in urban areas with large numbers of people in them. terrorists in america look like regular people. they are not wearing all black outfits and masks, or marching in groups down the middle of the street. they look like shoppers, coworkers and fellow subway riders. it is difficult to identify terrorists and that makes it difficult to discover their plans and stop therm. what we need to remember is this; these are not random attacks. they are, most times, planned out and carried out by radical islamic terrorists who absolutely hate western civilization. when or if we see something odd or suspicious, we must say something. if a guy is standing in line at walmart buying 4 pressure cookers, that’s something odd. we cannot assume that everyone around has our best interests in mind. if you see something, say something.  we need a president who will get serious about vetting immigrants, stemming the tide of refugees and illegal immigrants and keeping americans safe. we know which person will do that if elected and it isn’t hillary. if hillary wins, she will bring more refugees in. she has said it. if trump wins, he will put an end to our destructive immigration policy. and that is what he has said. the safety of americans on our own soil must be paramount. it is time to get serious about which people we let in and which ones we don’t. there are 7 knife victims and 29 bombing victims who deserved better. they deserve a government that puts them first. while the knife attacker in the mall was thankfully taken out by an armed officer, new york city police commissioner james p. o’neill said “i am concerned, we have a bomb that detonated and no one apprehended.” that’s right, the bomber is still out there. if you see something say something…before you can’t.         terror in the usa: bombs found in ny & nj made by same person [video]

__label__1 last saturday, thousands of people were about to participate in a charity 5k race to benefit marines and sailors in new jersey when they discovered a bomb had been planted in an area where the crowd would be standing. later that evening, nine people were stabbed at a shopping mall in minnesota in a horrific act of violence by a man making references to ‘allah’.   obama, the president of the united states, must have heard about the new jersey and new york bombings earlier saturday before giving his speech at the congressional black caucus foundation dinner. minnesota stabbings had just barely happened. dozens were injured, so obama must have been told, right? then about 8:40 pm, a dumpster exploded outside of the associated blind housing facility in new york city. there we no sensitivities as obama began his speech. 2 minutes into his speech he joked about ‘isil’ which was terrible, horrible and very tacky timing. “i don’t know about you guys, but i am so relieved that the whole birther thing is over,” obama said. “i mean, isil, north korea, poverty, climate change, none of those things weighed on my mind like the validity of my birth certificate.” at one point in the speech, he delivered an impassioned plea to the black community to stop donald trump, saying he would consider it a “personal insult” to his legacy if black voters didn’t turn out for hillary clinton. looks like the democrats are struggling and rightly so as the ny post just reported on a new poll that shows trump dramatically increasing with black voters. trump just saw a 16.5 percentage-point increase in backing from african-american voters in a los angeles times/university of southern california tracking poll, up from 3.1 percent on sept. 10 to 19.6 percent through friday.         disgraceful: obama jokes about isis on the day america is bombed twice [video]      
__label__0 donald trump’s campaign manager kellyanne conway praised her candidate for showing restraint at the tail end of monday night’s debate when hillary clinton attacked his history of disrespectful and derogatory remarks about women. “i have to say, certainly as a woman, i appreciated the restraint at the end. i am not sure i would have been able to exercise it myself, but restraint is a virtue and it’s a presidential virtue,” conway told msnbc’s morning joe tuesday. “to tell hillary clinton after she accused him of being terrible with women, to tell hillary clinton ‘i was prepared to go rough tonight and i am not going to do it because your husband and daughter are here.’ that is going to grow in importance in the next couple of days in a moment of great temperance and restraint.” story continued below with just minutes left in monday night’s debate, clinton managed to work in a line of attack against trump that she has also used most-recently in a new campaign ad, hitting the manhattan billionaire as “a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs.” after the debate, trump told cnn that ““i was going to say something extremely rough to hillary, to her family, and i said to myself, i can't do it,” indicating that he was uncomfortable leveling such an attack with clinton’s husband and daughter in the audience. tuesday morning, conway was happy to fill in the blanks for viewers wondering what exactly trump’s attack might have been. “i think he could have said what was on millions of americans’ minds, no doubt, that are we going to relitigate who’s been good to women and who hasn't?” conway said. “they’re taking a couple comments he made over any number of years as a private citizen, versus where he could have gone, and i think we all can finish the sentence. people did last night, they finished the sentence, they said, you know, maybe he was going to talk about bill clinton's record with women, but he decided not to.” overall, conway said clinton failed to deliver a “knockout punch” that would have forced trump into a major error. instead, trump’s campaign manager said the former secretary of state came off as rehearsed and determined to squeeze her talking points into the conversation, regardless of how pertinent they were to the questions of moderator lester holt. “donald trump is guilty of answering the question asked, and i thought hillary clinton last night wanted to make sure that no matter what was asked and what was answered, she was going to repeat back to us everything that she had learned in the last week or two weeks, and that’s fine,” conway said. “i don't think hillary clinton did a thing last night. if somebody can correct me, what was the big takeaway moment where she offers this huge vision for economic growth and an end to wage stagnation,” she added. “so i didn't hear any big moment for her where she convinced the 70 percent of americans who want change, who want a different direction, that she's their gal.”      trump camp: ‘donald trump is guilty of answering the question asked’      
__label__0 house speaker paul ryan is facing a major obstacle in his months-long quest to pass criminal justice reform: unenthused house republicans still skittish about looking soft on crime. the wisconsin republican for weeks has repeated his personal desire to move a bipartisan package that would include allowing well-behaved nonviolent prisoners to be eligible for early release and easing some drug-related sentencing requirements. story continued below it would mark a major accomplishment for the speaker, and a chance for republicans to show racial minorities they care about issues of social justice — plus a salient, positive message countering donald trump’s racially charged bid for the white house. but the odds are decidedly long. with trump advocating for controversial policies like systematic “stop and frisk,” and the protests in charlotte, north carolina, against police-involved shootings causing racial tensions to flare, ryan’s conference is not eager to vote on the matter. an internal gop leadership “survey” last week taking house republicans’ temperature on the issue showed that most members were lukewarm at best. that means that if ryan wants to make a push for criminal justice reform after the election, he will have his work cut out. “it’s not an easy thing to make these reforms, and the [judiciary] committee has taken some time doing it; now they’re taking time educating members on it,” majority leader kevin mccarthy (r-calif.) said monday of a package of bills drafted by the judiciary committee. “it is a priority for the speaker. there are concerns … so we’re getting all the questions answered.” the judiciary panel last year passed 11 bills to reform federal sentencing laws and improve the prison re-entry system. while the package would not eliminate mandatory minimum sentences, it would significantly reduce sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. it would also create a program to reduce recidivism rates. the politics of criminal justice reform have soured for conservative supporters. trump has warned repeatedly of dangerous, crime-ridden cities. and the fbi on monday released new statistics showing that murders increased 11 percent and violent crimes rose 4 percent in the u.s. last year. though the rates are still low by recent historical standards, it's enough to make law-and-order republican lawmakers nervous. while proponents argue that reform would go a long way toward easing racial tensions, opponents vow they’ll never vote against the recommendations of law enforcement during a time of unrest. (some republican lawmakers worry that law enforcement could come out against the pitch, though many national police groups haven’t taken a position.) even if ryan managed to get a bill through the house, the senate and its 60-vote threshold could stop it in its tracks. hawkish republicans, including sens. tom cotton of arkansas and jeff sessions of alabama, have been sounding the alarm against criminal justice reform. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) has shied from the matter because it divides his conference. democrats by and large support the reform proposals. sources familiar with ryan’s thinking say he’s not ready to relent just yet because of the charged political environment. while he wasn’t able to pass the judiciary package in september as he originally hoped, ryan is now eyeing the lame-duck session, by which time tensions might have eased. “i’m trying to get criminal justice reform done this session of congress,” ryan said last week during a speech at the economic club of new york. “that train is on the tracks, and i’m hoping we can get that done sooner rather than later.” the speaker has made second chances and redemption a central theme of his “better way” policy agenda, and he views criminal justice reform as key to helping people trying to turn their lives around. during the new york speech, he talked about visiting impoverished communities and being inspired by a onetime drug dealer who became a counselor to addicts, and a gang leader who went on to become an entrepreneur. “i went in expecting to see the worst of america and i came out realizing i had just seen the best of america,” he said. ryan will have the backing of some big-name conservative allies. the koch brothers and the conservative group americans for tax reform are major advocates of criminal justice reform. but the skepticism or resistance among republicans is real. “it doesn’t sell back home right now,” said rep. bill flores of texas, chairman of the republican study committee. “when you say, ‘hey, i’m voting for criminal justice reform,’ they’ll say, ‘what? you’re letting prisoners out of prison early?’” while he personally believes the justice committee has crafted some smart proposals, flores said it doesn’t help that it’s a key priority of president barack obama. the situation in charlotte and elsewhere has also complicated the equation. “i think that what could be a good bill could be perceived differently because of current events,” he said. rep. peter king of new york said he’s struggling to make up his mind on the pending reform measures. “i have friends on both sides of the issue, but i don’t know,” he said. “you’re talking about undoing 20 to 30 years of legislation. what are the unintended consequences?” rep. jim jordan of ohio, who leads the conservative house freedom caucus, said criminal justice reform “has real merit” but that there are “also some concerns.” “if you’re actually going to let people out of prison early, we better make sure they’re not violent people,” he said sunday on c-span’s “newsmakers” show. “so let’s do it, but let’s do it right.” house leaders hosted a series of member and staff meetings during the august recess to familiarize republicans with the judiciary bills. gop leadership sources say these sorts of sessions can move the needle, and they’re hoping that, over time, the conference will come around. ryan, however, is racing against the clock. house republicans will have to fund the government for all of 2017 during the lame-duck session, a contentious issue for the unruly gop conference. it’s unclear whether ryan will have the political capital and the bandwidth to do both.      ryan pushes sentencing reform in face of skeptical gop      
__label__0 hillary clinton’s running mate tim kaine slammed donald trump’s debate performance, saying the gop nominee wasn’t prepared and near the end “looked like he was running out of gas and leaning on the ropes.” “i don’t think he was prepared, so in terms of the specifics, he offered very few specifics on any policy issue,” kaine said tuesday morning on the today show. “he did attack — that’s true. he didn’t offer specifics, with the exception of his big tax plan, which is huge cuts for the folks at the top." story continued below kaine said trump didn’t answer basic questions, such as about his tax returns, and he “showed that he was easily rattled.” he said clinton’s best moment came when trump was challenged on whether he said clinton has the “look” to be president. during monday’s debate at hosftra university in new york, moderator lester holt asked trump about previous comments he made that the democratic nominee doesn’t look presidential. trump responded that clinton doesn’t have the stamina, at which point clinton shot back that as secretary of state she had traveled to hundreds of countries and testified for 11 hours on the benghazi killings before a house committee, among other things. “she looked like she was ready for another 11 hours of debate, and he looked like he was running out of gas and leaning on the ropes,” kaine said.      kaine on trump: ‘he showed that he’s easily rattled’      
__label__0 donald trump on tuesday morning denied he was suffering from a case of the "sniffles" during his primetime debate showdown on monday night, when he could frequently be heard sharply inhaling through his nose. "no, no sniffles. you know, the mic was very bad, but maybe it was good enough to hear breathing," trump told "fox & friends." "but no sniffles. no cold." story continued below trump's sniffling became a viral sensation during the evening, with hillary clinton supporter howard dean raising a sensational theory about why trump seemed to be having some trouble. "notice trump sniffing all the time. coke user?" dean, a physician and former vermont governor, tweeted. some clinton supporters took pleasure in what appeared to be a minor ailment, especially after trump and his allies have floated conspiracy theories that the former secretary of state is suffering from chronic health conditions. clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia earlier this month, and almost collapsed after becoming "overheated" during a sept. 11 memorial service in new york.      trump denies he was suffering from 'sniffles'      
__label__0 donald trump and his campaign complained tuesday morning that debate moderator lester holt targeted him for unfair questioning while neglecting to ask hillary clinton about any of her various scandals. “they were leaving all of her little goodies out. they didn't ask her about, you know, much,” trump said on fox news’s “fox and friends.” “but i was asked about my tax returns, which i've told about 500 times. but, you know, i think i did — i think i really did well when we were asked normal questions. i think i did really well in answering those questions, but those questions are not answerable in a positive light.” story continued below still, trump was upbeat overall about the debate, which he said “went really well” despite “some hostile questions.” the manhattan billionaire gave holt a c+ for his performance as moderator, praising him for his issue-based questions in the first 45 minutes of the debate but attacking him as biased for a series of more direct questions about a housing discrimination lawsuit filed against trump’s real estate company in the 1970s, even though it was clinton who brought up the justice department lawsuit. “i didn’t think he did a bad job. you know, when you look at it, you watch the last four questions, he hit me on birther, he hit he on a housing deal from many years ago that i settled with no recourse and no guilt. he asked me about that,” trump said. “that's a beauty to be asked, you know, 40-year-old lawsuit, or older. i just hate to say it’s older because then you’ll know, then [fox news anchor ainsley earhardt] will say “’wow i didn’t know trump was that old.’ hey, she’ll be unimpressed.” “well, he didn't ask her about the emails at all. he didn't ask her about her scandals. he didn't ask her about the benghazi deal that she destroyed,” he said. “he didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. i mean, you know, there's no question about it. he didn't ask about her foundation.” attacking holt became a running theme from trump's campaign tuesday morning, as both his running mate and campaign manager took to the morning shows to criticize the moderator. "i was disappointed that lester did not get into some of the issues that had been in so much of the forefront of hillary clinton’s candidacy – the fbi investigation, pay to play, the whole disastrous events that took place in benghazi and libya – that never came up," gop vice presidential candidate mike pence said on good morning america. trump's campaign manager kellyanne conway took a similar line, saying on cnn tuesday that there were topics she wished holt would have raised. “i just would have liked to have heard more about benghazi or e-mails or the clinton foundation since these are very clearly in the news," she said. "you know, one of our guests last night was mark geist, not mark cuban, mark geist, who's a benghazi hero and survivor. and you know, he was within several feet or yards of them and i think it's a good reminder to be americans of what her record is on that particular issue." while the republican nominee insisted that he had outperformed clinton at the debate, he said that he struggled throughout the night with a defective microphone that made him difficult to hear for the audience in the debate hall. trump suggested that perhaps his microphone, which he said worked perfectly earlier in the day, had been tampered with. “i had a problem with a microphone that didn't work. i don’t know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. i wonder, was it set up that way on purpose,” he said. “my microphone, in the room they couldn't hear me, you know, it was going on and off. which isn't exactly great. i wonder if it was set up that way, but it was terrible.” asked if clinton had successfully managed to get under his skin during their 90-minute back-and-forth, trump said she had not until the end of the debate, when the former secretary of state brought up miss universe winner alicia machado, who trump called “miss piggy” and “miss housekeeping” because of her latin heritage. addressing trump directly about the name-calling, clinton said, “donald, she has a name. her name is alicia machado. and she has become a us citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this november." “i know that person, that person was a miss universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. the worst, the absolute worst. she was impossible, and she was a miss universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as miss universe,” he said. “she was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. we had a real problem. not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. this was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother teresa and it wasn't quite that way, but that's okay. hillary has to do what she has to do.”      post-debate, trump team hits moderator holt for 'some hostile questions'      
__label__0 nearly 55 million people viewed "debate-related" live videos on facebook, the social media site said tuesday morning. it's not clear for how long people would watch the videos, but the high number adds to the expectation that more than 80 million people will have watched the debate on television. some 18.6 million people on facebook in the united states generated 73.8 million likes, posts, comments and shares related to the debate. the top issues discussed were taxes, the islamic state, racial issues, the economy, and crime and criminal justice. trump dominated the conversation on facebook, taking 79 percent to clinton's 21 percent.      facebook: 55 million viewed debate-related videos      
__label__0 at last night’s debate, donald trump said he provided a “great service” for president obama by getting him to produce his birth certificate. he said hillary clinton lacks the stamina to serve as president. when clinton suggested he hasn’t released his tax returns because he doesn’t pay any taxes to the federal government, he did not respond with a denial: “it would be squandered, believe me.” and during a back-and-forth about his racial views, trump said he deserves “great credit” for refusing to discriminate at one golf club he owns—when he owns seven u.s. golf clubs. it’s hard to think of another year when those jaw-dropping statements in front of a massive audience wouldn’t have been big news. then again, trump also suggested the hack of the democratic national committee, which security experts blame on russia, might have been perpetrated by “somebody sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds.” he accused clinton of having some kind of meltdown “at the afl-cio the other day, behind the blue screen, i don’t know who you were talking to, but you were totally out of control.” he insisted that blowing up an iranian ship would not start a war. and when clinton complained that he would soon blame her for everything that has ever happened, he responded: “why not?” story continued below the question, of course, is whether any of these he-said-what? moments on the world’s largest stage will hurt trump. and after 15 months of his brazen assaults on political norms, the only honest answer is: who the hell knows? the two candidates on stage last night basically inhabited two different rhetorical universes, just as they have on the campaign trail. clinton stuck to her public persona as a politics-as-usual democrat with five-point policy plans and canned talking points about “trumped-up trickle-down economics.” and trump continued to flout political customs—he tried to interrupt 25 times in the first 26 minutes of the debate, according to vox—and say a lot of wild, perplexing and untrue things that may well overstimulate the national fact-checking economy. clinton clearly seemed better prepared and more coherent last night, and moderator lester holt’s questions—nothing about immigration, benghazi or the clinton foundation, and her deleted emails barely came up—may have played to her wonky strengths. trump came off as an overconfident blowhard, the mouthy guy at the office meeting who never knew much about the topic, didn’t try to get himself up to speed in advance, interrupts all his female colleagues anyway, then tells them to wait until he’s done when they try to get a word in edgewise. trump did put clinton on the defensive over trade issues, and especially in the early minutes, he scored points portraying her as a tired politician who had stayed in the game too long. but he did seem a lot less comfortable and more agitated than he does at his rallies, as if mass adulation suits him better than one-on-one confrontation, and it did sound like the pundits—and the battleground focus groups—scored the contest as a victory for clinton. she didn't seem like the candidate who was totally out of control. beyond the style points, though, there does not seem to be a lot of recognition of just how remarkable some of trump’s comments were. some of those comments have become familiar through repetition, like his suggestion that in america’s minority neighborhoods, you can’t walk down the street without getting shot, or his claim that american jobs are “leaving in bigger numbers than ever,” when in fact unemployment has been cut in half since 2010. but as i’ve discovered after attending trump rallies, many of us have become so desensitized to his outrageousness that it no longer sounds as abnormal as it is. after all, his political incorrectness has become central to his brand; his supporters love that he isn’t afraid to say publicly things other politicians wouldn’t dare say privately. and whenever he drops a bombshell, he usually drops several more before we’ve recognized just how explosive the last one was. for example, federal reserve chair janet yellen is widely considered one of the least political people in washington, but it barely seemed to register last night when trump accused her of keeping monetary policy loose for purely political reasons—even though the policy should presumably be even looser if the economy were really in the shambles trump says it is. trump also casually suggested that obama will “spend the rest of his life on the golf course” after leaving office, a pretty disrespectful thing to say about a president, though obviously not as disrespectful as arguing that trump did him a favor by spreading lies about his citizenship. trump also tried to push the preposterous notion that clinton was a fervent birther, but a less effective one than trump, sounding like mitt romney would have if romney had suggested obama was a less effective governor of massachusetts. and it was really odd to see a 70-year-old man whose latest doctor’s note revealed that he’s flirting with obesity attack the physical condition of his opponent. modern presidential candidates just haven’t said things like that. then again, modern presidential candidates have always released their tax returns, which trump has steadfastly refused to do, citing an audit that, as clinton and holt both pointed out, is not a valid reason to avoid disclosure. clinton then pointed out that trump didn’t pay any federal income tax in the years he had to release his returns to casino regulators, a swipe that trump could have easily ignored. instead, he interrupted her to boast: “that makes me smart.” and when clinton insinuated that maybe he still isn’t paying the federal taxes that support troops, schools and health care, he again took the bait, not to deny that he’s a free rider, but to scoff that his taxes would just be wasted if he did pay them. that was a pretty damning non-denial. but before that could sink in clinton was attacking him for stiffing his workers—“dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers like my dad.” and trump once again embraced the charge, explaining that he doesn’t pay when he isn’t satisfied, and recommending that the country take a similar approach to its debts. when clinton pointed out that it would be a disaster if the country declared bankruptcy the way trump’s companies have, he said he had just taken advantage of the laws for his own benefit, because “that’s what i do.” it’s hard to imagine another presidential candidate saying that, but then again, it’s hard to imagine another presidential candidate expecting brownie points for allowing blacks in his club. trump also defended his sexist comments about rosie o'donnell, described the $14 million his father gave him at the outset of his career as "a very small loan," and undoubtedly made other incendiary comments i missed. somehow, that kind of rhetoric seems to be baked into the trump cake. he denied last night that he had ever called global warming a chinese hoax, even though the evidence remains on his twitter account. he also clung to his disproven claim that he always opposed the war in iraq, citing sean hannity as his character witness. trump just keeps blustering through, never admitting error, always assuming his confidence projects authority. and maybe it does. he’s in a tight race to be president of the united states. trump’s appeal is not really about details, which makes it complicated for the media to cover him. maybe it’s tendentious to fact-check his exaggerations and rehash his rhetorical flourishes when he’s really trying to convey a larger truth. like when he hits her for being a career politician by claiming she’s been “fighting isis your entire adult life.” but when you look at the transcript of, say, last night’s contentious discussion about race, it’s hard not to think that he’s getting a bit of a pass. i couldn’t help but think last night about all the abuse and ridicule heaped on vice president al gore during a fundraising scandal when he kept saying there was “no controlling legal authority” banning his actions. when clinton pointed out that the justice department sued trump’s company in the 1970s for refusing to rent to blacks, trump pointed out that lots of companies were sued, and that his settled with “no admission of guilt.” and then he said it again, after complaining that clinton mentioned the suit in ads. “frankly, i look at that, and i say, isn’t that amazing?” trump said. “because i settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt…it’s just one of those things.” it’s one of those things that won’t make the news tomorrow, even though “no admission of guilt” at least partially captures the trump approach to politics. he’s going to keep saying things that normal politicians don’t. he won’t apologize for them. he’ll attack the media for even questioning them. and his supporters will continue to love him for them.      donald trump’s wild night      
__label__0 alicia machado, the former miss universe winner who donald trump once called “miss piggy,” was “the worst we ever had,” the manhattan billionaire said tuesday morning, because “she gained a massive amount of weight.” hillary clinton called attention to machado’s case towards the end of monday night’s presidential debate, recalling that trump had not only called her “miss piggy” but also “miss housekeeping,” a reference to her hispanic heritage. addressing trump’s name-calling directly, clinton said “donald, she has a name. her name is alicia machado. and she has become a u.s. citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this november." story continued below trump said that while nothing clinton did throughout the debate to that point had managed to get under his skin, the former secretary of state’s decision to bring up machado did frustrate him. “that person was a miss universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. the worst, the absolute worst. she was impossible, and she was a miss universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as miss universe,” trump explained during a tuesday morning appearance on fox news’s “fox and friends.” “she was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. we had a real problem. not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. this was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother teresa and it wasn't quite that way, but that's okay. hillary has to do what she has to do.” clinton’s discussion of the former miss universe winner came amid a larger attack against trump’s history of disrespectful and derogatory remarks about women. of her gop opponent, clinton said “this is a man who has calling women pigs, slobs and dogs and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said that women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.” trump said he had considered replying by raising former president bill clinton’s history of infidelity as a response but opted against it because the couple’s daughter, chelsea clinton, was in the room. the manhattan billionaire said he might opt not to hold back such an attack at the next debate. “well, i may hit her harder certain ways,” he said. “i really eased up because i didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings. so, i may hit her harder in certain ways.”      trump again slams former miss universe over weight      
__label__0 presidential debate moderator lester holt pulled two candy crowleys, former new york mayor rudy giuliani said tuesday, accusing of the “nbc nightly news” anchor of mirroring crowley’s infamous mitt romney fact-check twice on monday night. in an interview with “fox and friends,” giuliani said he watched the debate two times — once live, “and then i went home and i watched lester holt do candy crowley at least twice.” story continued below donald trump, who had suggested a debate without a moderator ahead of monday’s faceoff, warned holt last week not to be like crowley, who interrupted romney in 2012 after the then-republican nominee said it took president barack obama 14 days to call the attack in benghazi, libya, an “act of terror.” (politifact rated romney’s criticism “half true,” noting that obama did say “act of terror” right after the attacks but that the administration did not speak “consistently in the days that followed.") giuliani took issue with holt “ignorantly” attempting to fact-check trump on the constitutionality of stop-and-frisk and the real estate mogul's false assertion that he never supported the iraq war. a federal judge in new york ruled the application of the practice unconstitutional, not the policy itself, as holt suggested, giuliani argued. “the thing that’s wrong is lester holt said straight out: stop-and-frisk is unconstitutional. lester holt is not a lawyer,” giuliani said. “he’s wrong. it was decided in 1959 by earl warren. it is still the law of the land.” the former mayor maintained that “every cop does stop-and-frisk in every part of america” but gave hillary clinton a pass for siding with holt “because she failed the bar exam.” “but i’m not gonna allow him to play lawyer and contradict our candidate,” he continued. “and i’d like to know: when did a moderator become a fact-checker? and if you’re gonna be a fact-checker, you better darn be right.” “i’m a lawyer. i’m not a moderator who misrepresents on television,” giuliani said, after co-steve doocy noted that giuliani was fact-checking holt. “i’m a lawyer. am i angry about it? i thought after candy crowley we saw the last of it. what holt did last night — if journalism has ethics, if it has ethics, he violated the rules of ethics. now if you’re gonna interrupt and you’re gonna correct me in front of 100 million people, you better be right. he is dead wrong.” giuliani continued this verbal broadside, slamming holt for being “completely unprofessional” and “totally unethical” and suggesting that “he should have had enough energy to check the sources” regarding whether trump supported the iraq war. “i saw the tape, and he opposed the iraq war before the iraq war,” giuliani said, despite numerous fact-checks that note trump voiced support for the war during a 2002 interview with howard stern. “a hundred million last night were misled by lester holt and so-called lawyer hillary clinton,” giuliani said.      giuliani slams lester holt for fact-checking like candy crowley      
__label__0 after a long night on long island on monday, donald trump showed no signs of wavering at an evening rally inside an airport hangar in melbourne, florida in front of a friendly crowd. a day removed from the debate stage, trump stuck close to his stump speech, repeating familiar refrains about himself, about hillary clinton, about his vision for his presidency and about the country he sees in front of him. the lone wrinkle to his stump speech was a new wave of claims about how he’d won the debate. pointing to his wins in numerous, un-scientific online reader polls on websites like the drudge report, trump was no more deterred by a broad sentiment among political observers that he’d lost than he was by an army of fact-checkers who’ve found many of his favorite claims are false. story continued below indeed, back in the familiar confines of a rally, trump appeared more comfortable than the night before, leveling strong attacks against clinton that, after repeating throughout the election, he often stayed away from monday. trump also cast the debate as a contrast between change and the status quo. “for 90 minutes on issue after issue hillary clinton defended the terrible status quo while i laid out our plan, all of us together, to bring jobs prosperity and security back to the american people,” he said. “for 90 minutes she argued against change while i called for dramatic change.” he also revealed how he dealt with his nerves in front of a television audience of 80 million people. “i knew i was going into a situation where you were going to have one of the largest audiences in the history of television. and i took a deep breath and i pretended i was talking to my family,” trump said. “it was very interesting. you just block it out.” “does everybody believe me? i was against going into iraq,” said trump, after the timeline of his opinions came under scrutiny once again on monday night. (before the invasion trump expressed approval of it in a howard stern interview, and is only documented as firmly opposing it in an interview well after the american occupation of the country began.) of the current state of the country, trump lamented, “we have death and debt and unemployment. we have all bad things.” he called clinton “a representative for globalists” and mocked last month’s consensus that he had only the narrowest electoral path to the presidency, remarking, “oh wow, now they’re looking at all these paths.” trump did steer clear of another post-debate controversy, an ongoing war of words with former miss universe alicia machado, who was the centerpiece of one of clinton’s attacks on his character. trump earlier tuesday again criticized machado's weight, echoing clinton allegations that he’d earlier called her “miss piggy” — due to her body shape — and “miss housekeeping,” a racist reference to her latino heritage. but on tuesday evening, back in front of a large, boisterous, adoring crowd, trump avoided the subject entirely. the rally followed a tumultuous 24 hours for trump, starting with a panned debate performance monday that morphed into a day of finger-pointing tuesday, as he revived his brashest personal style to explain an erratic debate performance. the gop nominee, beleaguered after an erratic performance in monday’s debate — with viewership as high as 100 million — retreated to his fox news and twitter cocoon. there, he took potshots at debate moderator lester holt and cited unscientific internet surveys to prove he’d outperformed hillary clinton. and his advisers hinted that he might consider skipping the next showdown between the candidates, set for oct. 9 in st. louis. it was a scarcely concealed defensive posture from the trump camp, which found itself defending trump against accusations of sexism (even as he redoubled his criticism of a former miss universe he had previously called “miss piggy,” saying on tuesday she had gained “a massive amount of weight”). his surrogates, too, joined the pile-on against holt, describing “hostile” questioning about his position on the iraq war, his role in the birther controversy and his refusal to release his tax returns. trump spent his post-debate morning in the friendly confines of fox, calling in to “fox & friends” for a gentle interview, where the hosts agreed he had been asked too many tough questions. trump couched his concerns about holt around mild praise of his performance as moderator, but his allies correctly pointed out that holt reserved his most probing and personal questions for the businessman and spared clinton similarly tough questions about her handling of classified information or her untrustworthy persona. “you know, when you look at it, you watch the last four questions, he hit me on birther,” trump said, “he hit me on a housing deal from many years ago that i settled with no recourse and no guilt. he asked me about that.” but actually, it was clinton who raised the 1973 housing discrimination lawsuit against trump’s company. she also grilled him about paying no income tax over the years. trump’s “that makes me smart” reply has democrats salivating. (clinton at a rally on tuesday afternoon asked the crowd, “if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make all the rest of us?”) trump on tuesday morning floated the idea that he “may hit her harder” next time around, and explained, “i really eased up because i didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings.” it was remarkable how many subjects trump decided to skip in monday’s debate. he made no mention of clinton’s handling of the attack on an american compound in benghazi. he scarcely alluded to his aggressive seal-the-borders stance on immigration, despite making it the hallmark of his campaign. trump didn’t mention controversies about clinton foundation or her ties to wall street. (clinton actually got in the only wall street-based attack, suggesting trump was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt to big banks.) trump also skipped any mention of clinton’s decision to label some of his supporters “deplorable.” and even as she skewered him for misleading about his position on the war in iraq, he made only a passing mention of the fact that clinton voted to go to war in the first place. “well, he didn't ask her about the emails at all. he didn't ask her about her scandals. he didn't ask her about the benghazi deal that she destroyed,” he said about holt. “he didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. i mean, you know, there's no question about it. he didn't ask about her foundation.” holt wasn’t the only target of trump’s ire. he also peddled a conspiracy theory that his microphone had been tampered with, as he sought to explain why he may not have been at the top of his game, even as he claimed numerous online polls deemed him the night’s winner. “i don’t know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. i wonder, was it set up that way on purpose?” trump asked on fox. clinton reveled in trump’s squirming. buoyant from the prior night, the former secretary of state gaggled with reporters on her plane, offering a verbal shrug to the notion that trump may not show up to the next two debates, and landing a zinger about trump’s microphone theory. “anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night,” clinton quipped as she walked away from reporters. trump’s surrogates sought to frame the debate as a win for the republican nominee, largely because he didn’t bring up bill clinton’s extramarital affairs, even though trump alluded to them later in the evening. kellyanne conway, trump’s campaign manager, said on tuesday morning that “as a woman” she was impressed that trump pulled back from bringing up the affairs after clinton attacked him for a long history of misogynistic comments. “to tell hillary clinton after she accused him of being terrible with women, to tell hillary clinton 'i was prepared to go rough tonight and i am not going to do it because your husband and daughter are here.' that is going to grow in importance in the next couple of days in a moment of great temperance and restraint,” conway told msnbc’s “morning joe.” trump’s running mate, mike pence, parroted the talking points on cbs’s “this morning,” also saying he was “so proud” that trump didn’t bring up bill clinton’s indiscretions. “ninety minutes in a row of one insult after another and then donald trump, just completely open and transparent with the american people, said, ‘there’s things i could bring up, we all know what they are, we all lived through the 1990’s,’ and he just said ‘i’m not going to do it.'” pence said. “i think there you saw in him the restraint and temperament that would make for a good president.” while trump’s allies argued that trump had cleared an arguably low bar during his first primetime showdown, house speaker paul ryan offered unusually effusive praise for the republican nominee. ryan has frequently clashed with trump on style and substance, but he said the billionaire did what he needed to do on monday night. for republican lawmakers concerned about trump’s effect on down-ballot races, the fact that trump did not implode on stage was a relief. “i saw donald trump give a spirited voice to those of us who don’t like the status quo, and i see emerging in front of us the potential for what a unified republican government can get you, which can be the solutions,” ryan said at a news conference tuesday. “i think he passed a number of thresholds... and showed that for 90 minutes he could go toe-to-toe with hillary clinton.” most pundits agreed trump’s strongest part of the debate was the first 20 to 30 minutes, when he parried clinton’s barbs and painted her as a typical politician – the kind he certainly is not. in a discussion of the country’s international trade deals, trump thrashed clinton as taking a politically motivated tack. “in all fairness to secretary clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently,” he said. “she's been doing this for 30 years. and why hasn't she made the agreements better? the nafta agreement is defective … secretary clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.” trump said he’d tax companies who send jobs and plants to other countries and sell their products back to the united states. “what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to mexico or some other country, good luck. we wish you a lot of luck,” he said. “but if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.” trump’s camp is already hinting he’s considering taking a pass on the next debate. trump surrogate rudy giuliani told reporters monday night that he’d advise trump to drop out of the next meeting because the moderators wouldn’t be fair. “if i were donald trump i wouldn’t participate in another debate unless i was promised that the journalist would act like a journalist and not an incorrect, ignorant fact checker,” giuliani said. “the moderator would have to promise that there would be a moderator and not a fact checker and in two particular cases an enormously ignorant, completely misinformed fact checker.” clinton and her allies, on the other hand, are blanketing the airwaves. priorities usa immediately launched an ad blasting trump’s temperament. the clinton campaign issued its own blistering video: an interview with alicia machado, the former miss universe winner who said trump demeaned her when she gained weight. campaign strategist joel benenson told cnn on tuesday that clinton was calm and collected under pressure while trump became unhinged. “the reason why hillary clinton overwhelmingly won in this debate is because donald trump was a loose cannon throughout the debate,” benenson said. “he was interrupting. he doesn't listen to anybody. he doesn't respect anybody. he was shouting.” in addition, clinton, her running mate tim kaine and her husband, former president bill clinton hit the trail for her, hoping to capture some momentum from the debate. cnn's post-debate polling showed viewers largely found clinton superior to trump, though it’s unclear whether the debate will lead to movement in the swing-state polls, which have shown the two candidates in a dead heat. louis nelson, nolan d. mccaskill, and madeline conway contributed to this report.      trump points fingers after shaky debate      
__label__0 hillary clinton campaign manager robby mook said donald trump “spiraled out at the end of the debate” monday night as faced tough questions from moderator lester holt and attacks from the former secretary of state. “we saw him to begin to unwind and become unhinged. and as you pointed out, by the end of the debate, that temperament that we're all concerned about, that inability to, you know, think clearly and make good judgments, it just came out,” mook said of trump’s performance in an interview on cnn’s “new day.” story continued below “you know, he just doesn't have the temperament to be president of the united states. you think about if donald trump were to sit in the situation room for an hour or 90 minutes and unwind this way,” he added. “i mean, i think it was a huge warning sign. i think that's why, two to one, people think hillary won this debate.” perhaps the biggest blow landed by clinton monday night came late in the debate, when she attacked trump’s history of derogatory remarks against women. in a post-debate spin room interview, trump said he had considered responding by raising bill clinton’s history of marital infidelities but opted against it because the couple’s daughter, chelsea clinton, was in the room and trump though such a comment would be disrespectful. tuesday morning, mook dismissed that potential line of attack from trump, as well as the manhattan billionaire’s threat that he may use it in subsequent debates. the clinton campaign manager said trump was reverting to his primary debate form as a bully because he was lacking on substance on the debate stage. “you know, donald trump is a great reality television star, that's where his career really went to the next step. this is -- it's such an obvious dodge. he spiraled out at the end of the debate and so, of course, he wants to bully,” mook said. “and so he wants to talk about the supposed indiscretions. the american people want to hear how someone's going to create jobs, how they’re going to help them afford education and health care. and he came with no plans. he came with no substance and he had no command of the issues. so this is his way of wallpapering that.” “trump wants to talk about anything but the actual issues that people care about and that's because he didn't prepare,” he added. “he didn't show up ready to talk about the things that matter in people's lives, and it's unfortunate. we'll see what he does next.”      clinton camp: trump ‘spiraled out at the end of the debate’      
__label__0 hillary clinton on tuesday dismissed donald trump’s conspiracy theory that his microphone was tampered with ahead of monday’s presidential debate, framing his excuse as a signal that he had a bad night in what was effectively a rhetorical mic drop. the republican presidential nominee told “fox and friends” in a phone interview tuesday morning that he was having problems with his microphone monday night. “i don’t know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. i wonder, was it set up that way on purpose?” trump said. story continued below after a brief gaggle aboard her campaign plane later in white plains, new york, clinton turned back toward the crowd of reporters to take one final question after initially saying “thank you” and walking away. while the question itself is unclear, a woman can be heard asking about a microphone, prompting clinton to take a scathing parting shot at her opponent, as evidenced by the audible reaction (which included a group “oooh”) on the plane. “anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night,” clinton quipped as she walked away from reporters, this time for good.      clinton zings trump on microphone conspiracy theory      
__label__0 capitol hill republicans grumbled tuesday about donald trump’s debate performance, but they also saw a silver lining: he didn’t overtly screw up their own election prospects — at least not yet. they didn’t need a lot from him: just don’t let the floor collapse on the republican party with an election-altering gaffe. so even after their nominee all but admitted paying no federal taxes and stood by his attacks on a woman for gaining too much weight, plenty of congressional republicans were breathing a sigh of relief. and no one was predicting doomsday on nov. 8. story continued below “he made his points and he didn’t make any major mistakes. … so i think he had a very good night,” said rep. tom cole of oklahoma. “we’re to the point now that our presidential nominee is helping us, not hurting us, and that was an unknown several months ago. he’s performing above expectations and we’re benefiting from it in the house and will probably benefit from it in the senate as well.” that’s a remarkable change in tone for the party that fretted for months about a down-ballot backlash against their nominee. republicans worried trump’s controversial comments would cripple their incumbents and wipe out their senate and possibly even house majorities. but trump’s improved performance this month has buoyed congressional republicans, to the point that those fears have morphed into hopes of minimal house losses and keeping the senate. and while his performance monday was far from flawless — he was too easily goaded by hillary clinton instead of hammering at her vulnerabilities, several republicans said — it could have been a lot worse. “i think it’s basically a wash,” said sen. roger wicker of mississippi, who heads the senate republican campaign arm. “i think he did just fine.” house speaker paul ryan, who has been highly critical of trump’s controversial comments in the past, also gave the nominee’s performance a robust endorsement. “i saw donald trump give a spirited voice to those of us who don’t like the status quo, and i see emerging in front of us the potential for what a unified republican government can get you, which can be the solutions,” the wisconsin republican said at a news conference. “i think he passed a number of thresholds … and showed that for 90 minutes he could go toe-to-toe with hillary clinton.” other republicans were less enthused. republican study committee chairman bill flores of texas said trump “made some good points, but he wasn’t as consistent as he could be.” another texan, house rules chairman pete sessions, said trump’s “abilities are greater” than he showed. and moderate rep. charlie dent, a frequent trump critic, said the nominee did not meet his goal of demonstrating that he could be presidential and substantive on the issues. “i think the reaction from a lot of people is: ‘in a nation of over 300 million people, this is the best we can do?’” the pennsylvania republican said. “i thought i was watching a dumpster fire.” rep. patrick meehan, also of pennsylvania, said trump “had an idea where he wanted to go,” but didn’t quite get there: “he started out strong but needed to be able to stay disciplined, and i think the next debate you’ll probably see him more capable of doing that.” even rep. lee zeldin (r-n.y.), a trump supporter, wouldn’t say trump won. “from the lens of trump supporters, they would believe he did well, and from the lens of a clinton view, they would say she clearly won,” zeldin said. “as for undecided voters, i don’t know. … each side scored some points. both sides as they watch the video afterwards may say, ‘maybe i should have answered this question a little differently.’” some republicans, including senate majority whip john cornyn (r-texas), didn’t want to talk about the debate at all. others claimed they didn’t watch it and therefore couldn’t weigh in. those who did, however, said one of trump’s weaker moments came when clinton attacked him for calling a former beauty pageant contestant “miss piggy” when she later gained weight. trump doubled down on those comments in an interview on fox news. asked about trump’s pageant comments, zeldin, without calling out trump specifically, said his best advice “for anyone running for office is to focus on your policy, your vision.” ryan wouldn’t comment on the pageant remarks. democrats on the hill, meanwhile, said trump’s performance showed why he shouldn’t be president. house minority leader steny hoyer of maryland said his answers proved it’d be “dangerous” for him to be “leader of the free world.” house democratic caucus chairman xavier becerra of california dodged a question about whether trump’s behavior — interrupting and talking over clinton multiple times — was sexist, but did say it was clear the gop nominee became “unhinged” over the course of the 90-minute faceoff. “and i think that’s the last thing we want for a president who will have his or her finger over the nuclear button, someone who becomes unhinged so easily,” becerra told reporters. “i think donald trump essentially showed who he is.” overall, though, several republicans didn’t feel trump’s missteps were a big deal. “i think there were some missed opportunities, but let’s face it: for all the complaining about the clinton camp, the bar was set low and all he had to do was prove he had a good temperament,” said rep. scott perry of pennsylvania. “i think he met that test, so i don’t now what all the complaining is about. … i’m not worried.” republicans also noted that trump showed again that he’s his own breed. during the debate, he railed against trade and backed democrats’ pitch to revoke gun rights from people on the “no-fly” list, for example. this, some felt, created a buffer to separate the party from the wild, and at times unruly, candidate. heather caygle and seung min kim contributed to this report.      hill republicans: at least trump didn't blow it

__label__0 hillary clinton’s decision to stand by her husband and attack former white house intern monica lewinsky when news of a sexual relationship between the two broke in 1998 prove that the former secretary of state is “too stupid to be president,” rudy giuliani said monday night. the former new york city mayor made the remark, captured on video and posted to twitter by elite daily writer alexandra svokos, in response to a question about clinton’s attack on trump’s past comments about women. giuliani defended trump, labeling him a “feminist” because of how he treats the women he employs, and said he would have responded to clinton’s attacks much more harshly than the gop nominee did. story continued below “i sure would’ve talked about what she did to monica lewinsky, what that woman standing there did to monica lewinsky, trying to paint her as an insane young woman when in fact monica lewinsky was an intern,” giuliani said. “the president of the united states, her husband, disgraced this country with what he did in the oval office and she didn’t just stand by him, she attacked monica lewinsky. and after being married to bill clinton for 20 years, if you didn’t know the moment monica lewinsky said that bill clinton violated her that she was telling the truth, then you’re too stupid to be president.” trump himself said monday night and again tuesday morning that he had considered raising the former president’s history of marital infidelities as a response to the former secretary of state’s attacks. he opted against it, he said, because the couple’s daughter, chelsea clinton, was in attendance and he though such an attack would be in poor taste. the manhattan billionaire did not rule out leveling such an attack at future debates. “well, i may hit her harder certain ways,” he told fox news tuesday morning. “i really eased up because i didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings. so, i may hit her harder in certain ways.”      giuliani: clinton 'too stupid to be president'      
__label__0 democratic national committee interim chairwoman donna brazile said donald trump’s refusal to apologize for spearheading the so-called “birther” movement that questioned the citizenship of barack obama is a “wound that won't heal.” recalling her visit over the weekend the newly-opened national museum of african-american history and culture as well as her own family’s history, brazile said trump’s hectoring of america’s first black president about his birth certificate recalled for her and many others the nation’s painful past. story continued below “donald trump should take just a walk through that museum and see what it means to have to produce papers. i mean, my ancestors could not get papers simply because they were brought here as slaves. and it took centuries before we could finally get papers,” she told cnn’s “new day” tuesday morning. “to bring this up over and over again, and to smear the first black president of the united states, donald trump should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize. i get emotional. i got a birth certificate. my parents had a birth certificate. my grandparents did not. my great grandparents did not.” the issue of trump’s support for the birther movement was raised late in monday night’s presidential debate by moderator lester holt, who asked trump what he would say to americans hurt by his championing of the issue. as he did at a press conference two weeks ago, trump blamed hillary clinton and her associates for first raising the issue and took credit for bringing the matter to rest. to those who might have been offended, the manhattan billionaire said “well, i say nothing, because i was able to get him to produce [his birth certificate].” brazile admitted that the apology she wants from trump is “not forthcoming, so i know i'm speaking into the wild darkness of donald trump, but i think he should be ashamed of himself to bring that up and to say -- and this is what he said, ‘i'm the one who got him to produce the birth certificate.’ it's amazing.” “i think it's a shame we put the president of the united states through this. it's just awful. and every time we talk about it, it's the wound. it’s the wound that won't heal,” she said. “and this is what donald trump should understand, it's the wound that will never heal as long as people go out there and exploit what i call real racial pain and animus in this country.”      donna brazile slams trump for not apologizing for birther claims      
__label__0 donald trump believes that "global warming is naturally occurring" and humans are not the cause, his campaign manager kellyanne conway said tuesday morning on cnn — a stance that flies in the face of the vast majority of mainstream climate science. conway was trying to walk back the manhattan billionaire's previous dismissals of climate change as a "hoax" driven by china. but while her remarks tuesday might seem less extreme on the surface, they still did nothing to assuage climate activists' fears that a president trump would attempt to bring a wrecking ball to the obama administration's efforts to head off the most catastrophic effects of global warming. story continued below "he doesn't believe it's manmade," cnn anchor alisyn camerota said to conway, referring to climate change. "correct," conway responded. camerota suggested: "so he believes the idea that it's manmade is a hoax." "no, i didn't say that," conway said. the sierra club tweeted afterward: "trump's campaign manager confirmed this morning that he doesn't understand science." hillary clinton had drawn attention to trump's beliefs on climate science during monday night's presidential debate, saying, “donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese.” trump interrupted to reply that “i did not, i do not say that." but in fact, trump has repeatedly made such remarks on twitter, writing in 2012 that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the chinese in order to make u.s. manufacturing non-competitive.” and in 2013, he posted that “ice storm rolls from texas to tennessee — i'm in los angeles and it's freezing. global warming is a total, and very expensive, hoax!” presented with those posts tuesday morning, conway said trump believes “that climate change is naturally occurring, that there are shifts naturally occurring,” but added that the gop nominee does not believe that those shifts are manmade. the vast majority of scientists disagree, saying carbon emissions from power plants, automobiles, agriculture and other human activities are driving climate change, although natural factors have an effect as well. conservatives often explain their opposition to cutting u.s. emissions by claiming nonetheless that global warming is an entirely natural phenomenon, even if they sometimes argue that warming has halted or is cyclical. conway also dismissed the notion that it is possible to grasp trump’s policy positions, be they on climate change or his stance on the u.s. invasion of iraq, from the non-traditional media he wields so frequently. “i think that's based on a tweet,” conway said when asked about trump’s previous statements that climate change is a hoax. “i just love that, that this whole man, whether he's giving a, ‘yeah, i guess so,’ answer to howard stern about invading iraq as a private citizen on an entertainment radio show, or through a tweet, we're supposed to understand all of his policies.” however, trump also described climate change as "a hoax" and "a money-making industry" at a december rally in south carolina, during his run for president. later, conway suggested that it is clinton, not trump, who has been unclear on the issue of climate change. “we don't know what hillary clinton believes because nobody ever asks her,” conway said, to which camerota replied that the former secretary of state had addressed the issue quite clearly at monday night’s debate. clinton also has repeatedly promoted her climate change agenda on the campaign trail. “oh, she gave us the canned, scripted responses, alisyn, about ‘somebody's going to be the clean energy super power,’” conway said. “look, i can't blame her. she obviously was overprepared and wanted to make sure we heard every single scripted moment, including the snarky ones that she had prepared to say.” gop vice presidential candidate indiana gov. mike pence, in a separate cnn interview, tried to recast his running mate's hoax comments as aimed at the notion "that bureaucrats in washington, d.c., can control the climate of the earth," and he blasted the obama administration's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. and pence also broke from both trump's stance and the earlier comments from conway in acknowledging that human activity was changing the climate. "well, look, there's no question that the activities that take place in this country and in countries around the world have some impact on the environment and some impact on climate," he said. tuesday's exchange on climate science occurred on the same morning that the centerpiece of president barack obama's climate agenda — regulations on power plants' greenhouse gas emissions — were facing crucial legal arguments in front of a federal appellate court in washington, d.c.      trump adviser denies climate change is manmade      
__label__0 hillary clinton will be at the next debate in st. louis and the one after that in las vegas, regardless of whether donald trump decides to show up, she maintained tuesday. former new york mayor rudy giuliani, a top trump surrogate, suggested that the republican presidential nominee forgo the remaining presidential debates unless he’s assured by the moderators that they will “act like a journalist and not an incorrect, ignorant fact-checker.” story continued below “well, i’m gonna show up,” clinton told reporters tuesday during a gaggle aboard her campaign plane in white plains, new york. “he gets to decide what he’s gonna do, but i will be there at wash u in st. louis and then after that in las vegas. if i’m the only person on stage, well, you know, i’m the only person on stage.” the next presidential debate is oct. 9 at washington university in st. louis, followed by an oct. 19 debate at the university of nevada, las vegas. trump skipped two debates during the republican primary — once to hold a competing fundraiser for veterans organizations and again because he was due to speak at a conference of the pro-israel lobbying group aipac (the latter debate was ultimately canceled after trump and john kasich pulled out). “nobody told me about debates. as you saw, i thought the last debate on cnn was the last debate,” trump told “fox and friends” at the time, though following that cnn debate he had told chris cuomo that he’s “had enough” of the debates after noting “they want to do two more.”      clinton says doesn't bother her if trump doesn't show up to next debate      
__label__0 an exasperated vice president joe biden told the crowd at a hillary clinton campaign rally in philadelphia that “donald trump is painfully uninformed” on the issues important to the presidency and expressed disbelief at the gop nominee’s rhetoric on the economy. “donald trump’s is painfully uninformed. no, no, this isn’t for cheering. i want to make an important point,” biden said, quieting the crowd at philadelphia’s drexel university. “and his policies are not very helpful for the country, but what bothers me about this race, and i know i’m sort of a one-man broken record on this, but what bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the american people.” story continued below biden alternated between speaking quietly, jokingly asking rally attendees if they’d seen monday night’s presidential debate, and raising his voice almost to the level of outrage as he railed against trump’s past statements on the economy. the vice president slammed the manhattan billionaire for bragging, as he did monday night, about not paying federal income taxes, suggesting that such a message did not resonate with hard-working, middle-class americans. the vice president’s harshest criticism of trump concerned the real estate mogul’s past statement that the 2007 crash in america’s housing market was good for his business. of such comments, biden rhetorically asked the crowd “what in hell is he talking about?” “look, i’ve been there for eight presidents, democrat and republican, i’ve disagreed and agreed. but every president i have served with, including the republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an american,” the vice president said. “can you imagine ronald reagan, the most conservative president we’ve had in a long time, can you imagine him saying, ‘it’s good business to take advantage of people’s misery,’ rooting for that misery? i really mean this. i am not joking. i am not kidding. what does it say about this man?” biden acknowledged clinton’s struggles to gain traction with young voters, who polls show are dissatisfied with both major party candidates and have thus gravitated to third-party options like libertarian gary johnson and the green party’s jill stein. but hillary clinton is in lock step with the majority of young people, biden said, on issues like marriage equality, abortion rights, and reducing the cost of college education. the vice president also told the crowd that he’s spent a significant amount of time throughout this election cycle answering questions from foreign leaders nervous that trump might win the white house. he said he’s had to reassure leaders from the baltic states concerned that the gop nominee might back out of america’s nato commitments and australian leaders worried that china’s influence in the western pacific might grow under trump. “look last night, you got a good look at both the candidates, you saw them both. hillary demonstrated she’s a leader, she has courage, she cares about the circumstances of the american people, not just the super wealthy,” biden said. “she thinks everybody should pay their fair share. we simply can’t elect a man who belittles our closest allies, embraces dictators like putin, a man who seeks to sow division for his own gain and his own benefit, a man who considers bluster and confuses that with strength.”      biden calls trump 'painfully uninformed' after rocky debate      
__label__0 republican vice presidential candidate mike pence said he was “so proud” of his running mate, donald trump, for “demonstrating restraint” during the first presidential debate monday night by opting not to bring up former president bill clinton’s extramarital affairs. the vice presidential candidate told cbs this morning that he was impressed that trump held back after clinton launched an “avalanche of personal insults” at him. story continued below “ninety minutes in a row of one insult after another and then donald trump, just completely open and transparent with the american people, said, ‘there’s things i could bring up, we all know what they are, we all lived through the 1990’s,’ and he just said ‘i’m not going to do it.'” pence said. “i think there you saw in him the restraint and temperament that would make for a good president.” trump hadn't always planned to refrain from using the former president’s scandals as a personal attack on clinton, but after the debate told reporters he was glad he changed his mind. “i’m very happy that i was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to bill clinton,” trump said. “because i have a lot of respect for chelsea clinton and i just didn’t want to say what i was going to say.” he added that he was going to say “something extremely rough to hillary and her family, and i said to myself, i couldn't do it. it's inappropriate. it's not nice.” trump had also threatened last weekend to invite gennifer flowers, a woman bill clinton admitted to having an affair with decades ago, to the presidential debate.      pence: trump ‘demonstrated restraint’ in debate      
__label__0 while his former opponent in the republican presidential primary spends the fall debating hillary clinton, former florida gov. jeb bush will be heading to harvard as a visiting fellow. at the harvard kennedy school of government’s program on education policy and governance, bush will visit the cambridge, massachusetts, campus several times this fall to deliver guest lectures on topics related to education and participate in student study groups. bush is the founder of an education policy think-tank. story continued below this thursday, he’ll also deliver the school’s annual edwin l. godkin lecture and discuss “the lack of economic and social mobility in the united states and his ideas for addressing those challenges,” according to a press release announcing the appointment tuesday. the son and brother of former presidents, bush entered the republican primary as a favorite of the party establishment’s donor base and an expected front-runner. he failed to gain traction, though, as voters gravitated toward other candidates — including the party’s eventual nominee, donald trump — and bush dropped out of the race in february after a poor showing in the south carolina primary.      jeb bush to deliver guest lectures at harvard this fall

barigazzi 9/27/16, 3:22 pm cet updated 9/30/16, 11:46 am cet bratislava — nato secretary-general jens stoltenberg struck back tuesday at donald trump over the u.s. presidential candidate’s claim that the atlantic alliance is now fighting terrorism only because of his criticism. “nato has been focused on the fight against terrorism for many, many years and it’s not a result of the u.s. elections campaign,” said stoltenberg in a press conference during a gathering of european defense ministers in bratislava. trump, who has been critical of nato and even gone so far as to question the u.s. membership of it, said monday night in a debate with his presidential opponent hillary clinton that he now supported the alliance. “i’m all for nato,” trump said. “but i said they have to focus on terror, also. and they’re going to do that. and that was — believe me, i’m sure i’m not going to get credit for it — but that was largely because of what i was saying and my criticism of nato.” also on politico zoya sheftalovich stoltenberg, a former norwegian prime minister, defended nato’s track record of fighting terrorism. “we went into afghanistan to prevent afghanistan from becoming a safe heaven for international terrorists,” he said, stressing that it was “our biggest military operation ever.” nato “has and is playing a key role in the fight against terrorism” and the organization has “stepped up our efforts to support the u.s.-led coalition to fight isil.” stoltenberg also said that nato’s newly created position of assistant to the secretary-general for intelligence “will also be a tool in our efforts to fight terrorism, to share intelligence.” but he insisted the role is “something which has been planned and discussed for a long time and is not a result of the u.s. election campaign.”  © 2016 politico sprl log in to access content and manage your profile. if you do not have a login you can register here.      nato chief counterattacks against donald trump      
__label__0 speaker paul ryan, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and house minority leader nancy pelosi are trying to hash out an agreement to break an impasse over government funding as the sept. 30 budget deadline fast approaches. in a series of three-way discussions on tuesday night, the trio of party leaders were forging a compromise to extend government funding until dec. 9. in turn, republicans would provide an "iron-clad commitment" that funding to address the water crisis in flint, michigan, will be included in the water resources development act, which covers hundreds of federal water projects. story continued below late tuesday, congressional leaders made headway on at least one part of the multi-layered discussions: pelosi and ryan agreed to incorporate an amendment to the sweeping waters legislation that would add about $170 million in federal aid for flint. "the amendment represents a bipartisan agreement between speaker ryan and leader pelosi to allow germane authorization language to be added to wrda as an amendment that will, at the end of the day, provide the necessary funding flint needs in the final wrda conference report," a pelosi aide said late tuesday night. the water resources legislation could head to the house floor as early as wednesday. pelosi and other democrats had refused to support any continuing resolution, or a cr, to keep the government open without the flint funding. ryan, for his part, faced problems rounding up gop votes for a short-term funding bill. with ryan and pelosi holding direct talks, a deal was expected soon to break the impasse. mcconnell and pelosi had also held discussions on the flint-wrda issue, said gop and democratic sources. mcconnell had been pushing to include flint funding in the wrda package. meanwhile, senate minority leader harry reid (d-nev.) had been making his own insistence for flint aid clear with republicans. earlier, senate republicans had been considering stripping louisiana disaster aid money from the stalled stopgap spending bill, which in theory could have resolved senate democratic objections to the legislation and ultimately stave off a government shutdown at the end of the week. that proposal had come after democrats voted tuesday to reject the stopgap spending measure — which would keep the government open until dec. 9 — because the package provides money for louisiana and other states but did nothing to address flint. mcconnell had been expected to unveil a revised legislative text with no louisiana disaster relief, one senior gop leadership aide said, but any formal action will now wait until wednesday. the kentucky republican floated the idea at a news conference tuesday shortly before the procedural vote failed 45-55, far short of the 60-vote threshold. "we keep hearing that their position is no flint, no floods," mcconnell said. "that's certainly an option worth discussing." informed of that comment, reid told reporters he wanted to see exactly what mcconnell would do, and again said democrats wanted relief for both louisiana and flint. but other democrats suggested the move would pave the way to a resolution. "if louisiana were not in there, it would reduce the profile of disaster aid in this bill. and that would be helpful,” said senate minority whip richard durbin. “there's still really deep felt feelings by our michigan senators and many others that this is just fundamentally unfair to the victims in flint and we don't trust the house to help at all,” durbin added. house minority whip steny hoyer also said democrats wanted assistance for victims in both communities, but that they would likely back a so-called continuing resolution that included aid for neither. “i doubt that we would turn that down,” he told reporters. hoyer said democrats would insist the legislation still contain $1.1 billion to combat the zika virus, which has long been stalled on capitol hill. the measure also includes popular provisions to fund veterans programs and implement a july law to curb prescription opioid addiction. senate republicans had argued that the proper place for flint aid is water infrastructure bill moving through congress. the senate passed the water resources development act, which includes $220 million for flint and other communities with failing infrastructure, on a 95-3 vote earlier this month. “why do you feel as if you have to punish people in louisiana who are digging out from a flood — sounds kind of crazy, but they have mud in their home they have to dig out — for flint when there’s a pathway forward on flint through the wrda bill?” argued gop sen. bill cassidy, who has repeatedly pressed the need for flood aid for his home state of louisiana. still, despite vows from some senate republicans that flint aid will be included in any final bill negotiated by the house and senate in a lame duck session, democrats had been skeptical. meanwhile, democrats also objected to language in the stopgap bill that continues a prohibition on the securities and exchange commission’s ability to require corporate disclosure of political spending. but that provision has been a secondary issue to the fight over flint. mcconnell and reid each accused the other of bringing the federal government to the brink of a shutdown, but few think such a politically-damaging scenario would take place just weeks before the presidential election. if the senate is able to pass a funding bill, the house would be expected to follow suit relatively quickly. among the 45 votes in favor of the bill were four democrats, including those representing conservative leaning states, like jon tester of montana, joe manchin of west virginia and joe donnelly of indiana, as well as bill nelson of florida, where the zika virus is spreading quickly. thirteen republicans joined most democrats in voting against the bill, including conservatives ted cruz of texas and mike lee of utah, and south carolina’s lindsey graham. cruz led a failed fight to include language blocking the obama administration from relinquishing oversight of the internet domain system to an international body. graham promised to oppose the bill because it would not lift financing restrictions on the export-import bank. heather caygle, rachael bade and annie snider contributed to this story.      mcconnell, pelosi, ryan seek deal on government funding impasse      
__label__0 officially speaking, monday night's debate was separated into three sections—achieving prosperity, america's direction, and securing america—but it didn't take long to explode into a range of issues from police-community relations to nato to donald trump's business practices and hillary clinton's stamina. how to make sense of it all? seriously, what just happened? we dialed in the experts on topics from criminal justice to international affairs to history, who detected some big moments that might have gotten drowned out in all the noise, from both candidates’ missed opportunities on foreign policy to an unprecedented invocation of direct racism on the presidential debate stage. and ... wasn't this thing supposed to have a republican, too? clinton showed she’s as un-serious on foreign policy as trump danielle pletka is senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the american enterprise institute. story continued below most of the debate between hillary clinton and donald trump had passed before we got to national security. by that time, trump had drifted—nay, sprinted—away from his strong opener to the rambling, bombastic incoherence that characterized his performance from about minute 20 until the end. and as when the blazing dumpster fire draws our attention away from the rodent-ridden alley, all eyes were drawn to the new york businessman, wondering what the hell he was going to say next. that’s a shame, because it was hillary clinton who articulated not a single fresh idea, not a single pivot away from the disastrous obama years, not a single vision. her foreign policy might well be summarized as “i’m not crazy trump.” and that’s far from enough. consider the substance (and here i set aside the series of catcalls that pass for trump foreign policy): on cyber-security, an issue about which clinton has already displayed some confusion, she stated that “we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information.” what does that mean? given the cyberattacks we’ve witnessed, didn’t she sit idly by as secretary of state? "not sitting" is not foreign policy. apparently clinton has “a plan to defeat isis.” what is it? literally, she led with “going after them online.” she threw in liberal hawk buzzword “intensify” about air strikes as if that represents a strategy. and she added that she would like to “take out their leadership.” take that al qaeda and isis! how do we protect the homeland? “an intelligence surge.” cooperating with muslim nations. that’s it, really. oh, and clinton loves the iran deal. and nato. the former secretary of state closed her national security argument claiming, “donald never tells you what he would do.” that’s spot on. the problem is, while clinton is more polite, more temperate and well … more normal, in her own way she’s as unserious about national security as the donald. the performer wilted; the bureaucrat stepped up virginia heffernan is author of magic and loss: the internet as art. on the debate stage monday night, hillary clinton notably called her opponent “donald,” a transparent move to gain the whip hand. donald trump called clinton “secretary,” but only after elaborately asking her permission, the way someone asks a vegan if she eats even bread, implying, “you’re so finicky, who knows what will bother you?” even formal terms of address between politicians would be played for schoolyard advantage, it seemed. until trump—the consummate bully, the master entertainer—wavered. soon enough, he lapsed into “hillary.” his initial “secretary” ploy, which at first seemed moderately promising—and might have teed up a sneering riff on political correctness later—lost his attention. he couldn’t commit to the bit, or any bit. the same was true all night. yes, trump, who never hit a false note as the capricious tyrant on the apprentice, somehow kept straying from the role he had played so many times on the debate stage during the primaries: performer. “message” has sometimes seemed protean with trump, but his persona has always been brightly limned, his modest vocabulary serving as trusty scaffolding for a self as solid and simple as a cartoon. tonight, however, that trump-brand trump slipped and slid, perhaps left wobbly without the crutch of a friendly crowd. rather than talk about the magnitude of his primary victory or the one he hopes for this fall, trump openly envisioned losing—twice. “if i don’t get to pennsylvania avenue one way, i’m going to get there another,” he said, referring to his company’s new hotel in washington, d.c., just down the street from the white house. when asked if he would abide by the outcome of the vote in november—trump has suggested he fears voter fraud—he dodged the question, rambled a bit, then, when pressed again, closed out the night with these final non-rousing words: “if she wins, i will absolutely support her.” the strongman didn’t look so strong. as the debate came to a close, trump himself confessed that he had fallen short of his usual routine: “i was going to say something extremely rough to hillary, to her family. and i said to myself, i can’t do it. i just can’t do it. it’s inappropriate, it’s not nice.” i can’t do it. he was talking like a loser. debate previews had suggested that clinton’s prep team was worried about her detail-packed disquisitions coming across as overly focus-grouped. they needn’t have. trump, who was expected to speak simple and with feeling, conjured internecine battles involving consultants and media people that must have been moving and powerful to exactly … no one. sidney blumenthal, patti solis doyle, wolf blitzer, sean hannity, debbie wasserman schultz: trump sounded positively wonky, like any old beltway cable pundit. as for clinton, she has a less clearly etched stage persona than trump, and seemed to come in committed to a predictably studied style. but, especially early in the debate, she deployed an imperious way of looking soap-operatically classy and above-it-all, with a supercilious smile and complicated headwork. it’s possible she was aiming for the texan woman exception, identified by the linguist deborah tannen (and cited recently in the atlantic), which states that of all women, only texans can pull off tough and brassy without being called shrill. clinton did not seem texan. she seemed smug, long-suffering. when trump interrupted her, she did a pursed-lip “i’ll just wait” move that some substitute teachers employ. it didn’t serve her. but because trump didn’t appear very threatening, she seemed to decide she didn’t need armor. she dropped the fake ann richards act after about 20 minutes. the surprise was that clinton did have something to fall back on. not the fake arkansas accent of her early years in public service, not the you-go-girl pantsuits thing from 2008, not a “love and kindness” age of aquarius jam. standing at a podium, in command of the facts, clinton fell back on herself—a clear-eyed strategist, with unlovely midwestern vowels and a map of geopolitics in her mind at all times. she seemed happy to be there. trump missed a historical opportunity on tax cuts josh zeitz has taught american history and politics at cambridge university and princeton university and is the author of lincoln’s boys: john hay, john nicolay, and the war for lincoln's image. watching monday night’s debate in the moment, it was easy to see each candidate as the embodiment of our current political polarization. democrats, we all know, are reflexive tax-and-spenders. republicans are tax-cutting fanatics with a mystical faith in the power of supply-side economics. slipping into those traditional partisan roles, clinton mocked “trumped-up, trickle down economics,” and trump claimed that clinton would tax america back to the stone ages (or at least the carter administration). but if those notes felt off in this strange policy year, where trump has dispensed with nearly all the gop's economic norms, they were even futher off if you consider the history they might have invoked. were trump a student of history, he might have pointed out that while democrats frequently point to reaganomics as an invidious form of class warfare, some of the largest and most productive tax cuts in modern american history were the work of two democratic presidents: john f. kennedy and lyndon johnson. the story goes something like this: in 1962, presidential aide walter heller convinced john kennedy, and later lbj, that the economy was underperforming by $30 billion. a tax cut–even one that increased the deficit temporarily–would stimulate growth, close the gap between economic potential and performance, and achieve full employment. ironically, though the measure was born in a democratic white house, some of its sharpest critics were liberal economists. leon keyserling, who served as chairman of the council of economic advisers under harry truman, agreed that the tax cut would stimulate the economy but calculated that the wealthiest 12 percent of americans would reap almost half of its savings, an outcome that struck them as both unjust and unlikely to help the economy much. the liberal economist john kenneth galbraith argued for stimulus spending instead. michael harrington, whose work on the hidden scourge of poverty had done so much to inspire the liberal imagination, scored the tax cut as “reactionary keynesianism.” yet the tax cut appeared to accomplish what its framers intended. in late february 1964, lbj signed into law the revenue act of 1964, which sharply reduced individual income tax rates. the results were almost instantaneous. in 1965 gnp exceeded even the cea’s optimistic forecast by a whopping $9 billion. “tax relief, in massive doses, appears to have achieved something like magic,” marveled u.s. news and world report. there are meaningful differences between the kennedy/johnson and reagan tax cuts. but trump missed an opportunity to claim a bipartisan mantle. and perhaps clinton, too, missed an opportunity to remind americans that democrats have in past decades reduced the tax burden on the middle class. at the debate, who did the better job of sounding like someone else? julie sedivy has taught linguistics and psychology at brown university and the university of calgary, and is the co-author of sold on language: how advertisers talk to you and what this says about you. in monday night’s presidential debate, donald trump was challenged about his claim that hillary clinton lacked “a presidential look.” in truth, this was a test of whether the candidates sounded presidential, a chance for voters to assess two candidates whose communication styles have left lingering reservations. clinton’s cool and technical language has reinforced perceptions that she is disconnected from many americans, whereas trump’s visceral style has left doubts about whether he can temper his passions when context demands it. to move voters, both trump and clinton were under pressure to stretch beyond their usual communicative range. for clinton, this pressure is complex. research shows that women who speak with emotional intensity are seen as less competent than men who do the same. achieving that “presidential look” means she has to be masculine enough, but not emasculating or heartless. she has struggled with this over the years; in a study of 567 interviews and debates, researcher jennifer jones concluded that clinton’s speaking style became more masculine with her growing political involvement and power, but that she struggled to find her rhetorical footing during the 2008 campaign, swinging between more masculine and feminine styles. on monday, both candidates responded with noticeable shifts in language. trump still leaned heavily on emotional trigger words (companies are “stealing our jobs”) and stacking adverbs and adjectives (“it’s bad, bad experience”; “we are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.”) but debate trump was far more restrained than rally trump, to the point of uttering acquiescent sentences such as, “as far as child care is concerned and so many other things, i think hillary and i agree on that. we probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts.” clinton’s language was more forceful and direct than usual. though she opened the debate with reference to her granddaughter’s birthday, she kept her sentences fairly short and simple. she talked about planning to “take out isis,” about coming back from the “abyss” of the recession, about how it's important to “grip this and deal with it” and about trump “stiffing” his employees. the strain of speaking in a different voice showed more on trump than clinton. he sniffed and fidgeted and sipped his water; she locked her gaze at the camera and showed no evidence of having bodily needs. his responses became increasingly disorganized and irrelevant; hers, though obviously rehearsed, maintained a tight structure, circling back to the moderator’s question even after launching an attack on trump, and articulating connections between principles and specifics. his sentences were often syntactically defective; hers displayed a neat rhetorical rhythm (“unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and yes, it determines how they’re treated in the criminal justice system.”) perhaps most striking was the fact that trump, self-described voice of those left behind, appeared to forget entirely about the voters who were watching him outside the debate hall. at his rallies, he stirs up the crowd by addressing them directly and, as many of them have said, speaking the things they can’t say aloud. on monday, almost every instance of the pronoun “you” was directed at clinton in one of his private skirmishes with her—about his support for the iraq war, about not paying his taxes, about not paying his workers, and what he has said about women. clinton, on the other hand, did not appear to forget for one moment that she was on a national stage. she addressed the audience directly at the beginning and end of the debate. and she even seemed to speak for the country toward the end when she declared: “i want to reassure our allies in japan and south korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.” the party that wasn't there matt latimer is a former speechwriter for president george w. bush. he is currently a co-partner in javelin, a literary agency and communications firm based in alexandria, and contributing editor at politico magazine. perhaps the most striking feature about last night’s debate was the absence of the republican party, at least as we have come to know it. even the party’s once revered first family, including the gop’s last two-term president, was a no-show, either in person or in spirit. oddly, if anyone had a favorable thing to say about the bush family, it would have been hillary clinton, who on monday touted the endorsements of former bush officials. before the debate began, by contrast, trump was reaching out to supporters of socialist bernie sanders. to be sure, there was one familiar exchange over ronald reagan’s tax cuts, and hillary clinton’s vague (and rather groan-worthy) attack on “trickle down” economics. but the brief contretemps seemed perfunctory and dated, with all the modern day relevance of the garfield era. throughout his unorthodox campaign, and quite remarkably, donald trump has completely jettisoned what only a year ago was republican orthodoxy on trade, on entitlement reform, on infrastructure, on the war in iraq. last nigth the severing was complete. to wit, the republican nominee began the debate aggressively lamenting the “rip off” of nafta, one of the trade deals about which republicans used to regularly brag. he sharply attacked the trans-pacific partnership, another deal that republicans made with the obama administration. he talked about wasting money on the iraq war – the signature issue of the bush era, to which many republicans in that very audience had once pledged unrelenting fealty – while our roads, airports, and bridges were crumbling (the usual talking points of washington democrats). mrs. clinton, by contrast, hardly bothered with her usual attacks on the republican party, since many of the party’s elites are gingerly backing her. for republicans who spent many years advocating policies now abandoned with, well, abandon, it was hard to know what to think about a worldview being remade before their very eyes, and a debate without anyone to represent them. indeed, the only traditional republican on that stage monday night was lester holt. a candidate dropped the r-bomb nicole hemmer is assistant professor at the university of virginia's miller center, co-host of the past present podcast and author of messengers of the right: conservative media and the transformation of american politics. it was a first for a modern presidential debate. when hillary clinton described donald trump’s actions as “racist,” she used a word that has never been used in a televised debate—and likely has never been used in any presidential debate. the charge came during a surprisingly frank discussion of racism from clinton. in past presidential debates, discussion of race in the united states has often been discussed in the distancing language of “race relations” or “racial problems.” in the past two election cycles, with the first black nominee, then the first black president on the stage, race wasn’t mentioned a single time over the course of six debates. (the closest they came was in 2008, when john mccain expressed his frustration with the suggestion that he was racist.) with discussions of race absent in the last two debate cycles, the depth and nuance clinton brought to the issue was striking. when asked how she would heal the racial divide in america, clinton spoke in terms of individual hearts and minds, which she then connected to the larger issue of systemic racism. clinton is not the first to discuss racism in personal terms. in a 1992 debate, bill clinton discussed his personal experience growing up in the segregated south. hillary clinton, however, did not just draw from personal experience, she connected the issue of personal prejudice— “implicit bias,” as she put it—to its effect on the pressing issue of discrimination and policing. but where clinton got revolutionary was in talking about the personal racism of her opponent. it came after the moderator, lester holt, asked trump about his role in perpetuating the birtherism lie. trump tried once again to pin birtherism on clinton’s 2008 campaign, and then crowed (falsely) about his role in ending the birther lie. that’s when clinton went in for the kill. she slammed trump for his role in perpetuating the “racist birther lie,” then broadened her attacked by pointing to trump’s own history with discrimination. noting that in the 1970s he faced two lawsuits from the justice department for racial discrimination, clinton said, “so he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.” note that this is different from calling trump a racist directly. she instead used the label to qualify his words and actions. but the use of the charge in a televised presidential debate is unprecedented, underscoring just how unusual the 2016 race is. maybe the closest we’ve gotten to a similar divide between the candidates on racial issues was in the debate between ronald reagan and jimmy carter in 1980. while carter didn’t claim his opponent was racist, he similarly drew on reagan’s past: “i noticed that governor reagan said that when he was a younger man that there was no knowledge of a racial problem in this country,” carter said. “those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem.” reagan, much like trump’s comment on monday that black and hispanic people were “living in hell,” pointed to the failures of government spending for young unemployed black people, ending with a specific case: “with regard to the great progress that has been made with this government spending, the rate of black unemployment in detroit, michigan, is 56 percent.” reagan’s detroit could just as easily be trump’s chicago. this is the key difference: carter hammered reagan on his failure to agree with policies like unemployment and minimum wage increases; he called his opponent insensitive to these people’s struggles. he did not call him racist. and the uniqueness of the racist charge on stage is due to the uniqueness of this election. given the trump campaign’s associations with white supremacist groups and the alt-right, and given trump’s personal history with discrimination, racism has been front and center in this election. from his slowness to disavow david duke to the frequency with which his son (and surrogate) retweets racist memes, trump has created a campaign that provides a safe haven for racists. critics have long pointed to journalists and politicians’ preference for euphemisms like “racially tinged” or “racially charged” or “insensitive” when the word “racist” could have worked. in this debate, there was no such tip-toeing. trump sounded like he was talking to black voters. he wasn't. issac j. bailey is a columnist at the sun news in myrtle beach, south carolina. he’s the author of proud. black. southern. (but i still don’t eat watermelon in front of white people). “african americans and hispanics are living in hell,” trump said monday night of democrats’ neglect of the lives of people of color. “you walk down the street and you get shot.” trump’s point, that the democratic party for decades has taken the black vote for granted, rings true in the minds of many black voters. it’s part of the reason i’ve voted for a variety of republicans myself. “trump just spoke the gospel about the democratic party,” commentator and professor marc lamont hill, an african american activist who has been making the same point for years, tweeted during that exchange. there are republicans who could have credibly made that point. rand paul, who has spoken eloquently about the need for criminal justice reform and racial disparities for years, is one of them. or just about any of the other 16 gop presidential candidate. but the republicans had someone else on stage, someone touting the racial-profiling program known as stop-and-frisk; telling black people they live in hell; and bragging about the dog whistle that is “law and order.” he rose to national political prominence on the bigotry of birtherism, and took a victory lap on the issue monday night. clinton, meanwhile, hit most of the right points, talking about implicit bias and the beauty and power of the african-american church and the need to hold police officers accountable while increasing the level of trust between cops and communities. she has come on strong about gun control policies that are toxic in the republican party but are seen as vital among activists who are trying to prevent violence in some of our nation’s largest cities. her policy points were clear: no more mandatory minimums, no more private prisons and a presidential budget that will include money to help better train cops on implicit bias and how to better handle the mentally ill. young millennials of color probably didn’t get fired up about her responses and likely wanted more, but the contrast with what trump is offering was too stark to miss. trump, it was clear, was still just using people of color as political props while promising to make their lives worse with race-based and criminal justice policies that have already destroyed or harmed millions of black families. he still wasn’t talking to us, or even about us, only a distorted version of who bigots believe we are. when asked about what he could do to bring a racial healing to the country, trump answered: “i say nothing.” that was his most honest moment of the night. on hillary's foreign policy vulnerability, trump whiffed aaron david miller is vice president for new initiatives and a distinguished scholar at the woodrow wilson international center for scholars. paradoxically, nowhere were the potential risks greater for hillary clinton than in the segment relating to national security and foreign policy. this, after all, was her sweet spot: as a former secretary of state, senator and first lady, she knew had both practical experience and a substantive grasp of the issues. all candidate donald trump needed to do tonight was appear somewhat knowledgeable, keep his calm, and act presidential and poised as a potential commander in chief. and despite the low bar, mr. trump failed to clear it. having worked for republicans and democrats (and voted for both, too) i say this not as partisan or cheerleader; but as an objective and common sense read on the evening. indeed, the last 30 minutes of the debate—the “securing america” section—was mr. trump’s weakest and seemed to validate his detractors’ criticism that he’s uniquely and stunningly unprepared, ill-suited temperamentally, and not ready for the prime time of the presidency. on iraq, mr. trump fell back repeatedly on the factually inaccurate notion that he had never supported the iraq war. he doubled down and angrily asserted a revisionist version of his stance, referencing conversations with fox news hosts that backed up his own position. in response, both lester holt and mrs. clinton called him out—leaving him flatfooted and without a compelling comeback. on isis, mr. trump fell back again on a policy response that was vacuous and incoherent. mrs. clinton’s policy approach was not her best moment either. but mr. trump again raised the fantastical notion that if only the u.s. would have taken iraq’s oil, isis could have been defeated. along with the extraordinary assertion earlier in the hour when he accused mrs. clinton of ineffectively fighting isis all of her adult life—a remarkable howler—mr. trump turned in one of his most rambling performances on an issue of great concern, particularly to his own constituency. on nato and u.s. allies, mr. trump tripped up on a point that has resonated effectively for him—that nato allies aren’t paying their fare share for their defense—by insisting that nato allies weren’t involved in counter-terrorism efforts alongside the u.s. mrs. clinton countered that the only time nato’s article 5—the agreement that an attack on one nato member is an attack on all of them—has been invoked was when u.s. allies committed to join the u.s. military efforts in response to 9/11. on cyber, mr. trump failed to address what moderator lester holt described as a central challenge to u.s. security. indeed, his initial response to the question — that 200 admirals and generals and ice had endorsed him—was off-message and particularly ineffective. his defense of russia against mrs. clinton’s accusation that moscow may have been responsible for much of the hacking was particularly self-serving, as was the implication that russia did the country a favor by exposing the dnc’s bias against bernie sanders. for mr. trump’s detractors (and a good many undecided voters, i suspect), the last 30 minutes of the debate confirmed an image of an off-balance, rambling, flustered and frustrated candidate hoping somehow that the debate would end. instead of conveying the image of a strong leader remaining calm under pressure, what we saw was a volatile combustible candidate trumpeting his winning temperament. that this quasi-meltdown came during a discussion of national security policy where americans expect a calm-but-tough and self-confident president created even more of a deficit for a candidate who simply wasn’t ready for primetime. trump dug in on “stop-and-frisk” while also dodging richard primus is the theodore j. st. antoine collegiate professor at the university of michigan law school. follow him on twitter at @richard_primus. donald trump returned to one of his campaign talking points tonight, praising the stop-and-frisk policing policy that new york city implemented under mayors rudolph giuliani and michael bloomberg. when moderator lester holt intervened on a point of fact—something he restrained himself from doing for much of the debate—and pointed out to trump that “stop-and-frisk” had been held unconstitutional, trump doubled down. stop-and-frisk had not been held unconstitutional, trump claimed: the case had been assigned to a judge who was biased against the police, and the ruling wasn’t upheld on appeal, because new york city mayor bill deblasio decided to discontinue stop-and-frisk rather than continuing the litigation. as a matter of debating tactics, this was a skillful parry by trump. it’s true that an appellate panel criticized the judge who handled the stop-and-frisk case—judge shira scheindlin—for compromising her appearance of impartiality in the case, largely through comments she made to the media. (it later cleared her of any misconduct.) and it is also true that no appellate court ever upheld the ruling, because new york city declined to appeal. trump, as he often does, succeeded in putting just enough fog around the issue to make it seem uncertain. and as a matter of politics, it’s clear why trump would dig in. stop-and-frisk resonates powerfully with voters who want to hear a get-tough, law-and-order candidate. but trump’s move was also something of a dodge. it didn’t acknowledge the reality that the court whose ruling is still the last legal judgment on the matter did hold stop-and-frisk unconstitutional. nor did it grapple with the problem of racial discrimination that lay at the heart of the constitutional challenge to the stop-and-frisk policy. the case, formally called floyd v. city of new york, was built on mammoth piles of statistical analysis showing that new york city police systematically stopped and frisked nonwhite people at rates far higher than they stopped and frisked white people, and the differences couldn’t be explained away by other factors. the case also featured testimony from police sources directly confirming that new york city police were often instructed to treat nonwhite people as suspicious in circumstances where white people doing the same things would not have been regarded as suspicious. in other words, floyd rested on a thorough and detailed record showing racial profiling by the police. public safety improved in new york city dramatically during recent decades, and the city’s police officers and public-safety policymakers deserve an important share of the credit—though it’s hard to say how much stop-and-frisk contributed to the improvement. after all, stop-and-frisk was instituted after crime in new york had already fallen substantially, and crime continued to go down after the policy was terminated. and given the factual record, it is hard to see how one can endorse new york’s stop-and-frisk policy without endorsing racial discrimination in policing. which might, for a certain constituency, be exactly the point.      the debate: what we just saw      
__label__0 orlando — tim kaine and mike pence are both feeling more pressure to perform in their own vice presidential debate after monday's caustic contest between donald trump and hillary clinton. kaine spoke to clinton shortly after, disclosing to a crowd at a democratic field office here that his running mate's debate chops raise expectations for kaine to match her. story continued below "man, you've really raised the bar. you put the kind of pressure on me that i like to really help my debate next tuesday," kaine recounted telling clinton in a speech to field organizers here. pence expressed similar sentiment, saying on fox news he's been dusting off his capitol hill experience to get ready to go toe-to-toe with the virginia senator. "donald trump raised the bar for his running mate last night,” pence said. from there, however, the two vice presidential hopefuls' assessments diverged. pence said that trump took "command" of the stage while kaine likened the gop nominee to a heavyweight prizefighter on the verge of quitting. "if you're that rattled in the debate, try being president," kaine said. "donald trump was up on the split screen like a boxer ready to go down on a tko." louis nelson contributed to this report.      kaine, pence both feel pressure after monday's debate      
__label__0 minorities in america’s inner cities “are living in hell,” donald trump said in response to a question about healing race relations. “we have a situation where we have our inner cities, african-americans, hispanics, are living in hell, because it's so dangerous,” trump said. “you walk down the street, you get shot. in chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands, since january 1st. thousands of shootings. and i say, where is this? is this a war-torn country? what are we doing? and we have to stop the violence, we have to bring back law and order, in a place like chicago, where thousands of people have been killed. thousands, over the last number of years.” story continued below it was a twist on what has become one of trump’s signature lines in his pitch to the african american community: “what do you have to lose?” trump often uses the line after listing what he says are the litany of problems in american cities, which he pins on democratic politicians. trump also hit clinton for not saying “law and order” in response to the question. clinton, for her part, said trump misunderstood the state of america’s inner cities. “well, i've heard donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country,” she said. “the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. there's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.” trump has struggled badly amongst african-american voters, but has sought to close the gap in recent weeks with events in african-american churches.      trump at debate: minorities in cities 'are living in hell'      
__label__0 donald trump made his way into the spin room moments after the close of the debate and told reporters he was proud that he did not bring up former president bill clinton’s extramarital affairs. “i’m very happy that i was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to bill clinton,” trump said to a gaggle of reporters. “because i have a lot of respect for chelsea clinton and i just didn’t want to say what i was going to say.” story continued below and what exactly, a reporter asked, was that going to be? “i’ll tell you maybe at the next debate, we’ll see,” he responded. a candidate’s presence in the spin room, where surrogates and advisers typically pitch their take on the debate to reporters, was unusual. but trump, with his wife melania at his side, took a few questions. “i think it went better than i ever thought,” he said of the debate. “i loved it, i loved it.”      trump 'happy' he didn't bring up bill clinton's affairs      
__label__0 “the kind of plan that donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again” and “it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of people in this country.” —hillary clinton she is correct that the wealthy would be the biggest winners under donald trump’s tax-reform plan. the top one percent of earners would see their after-tax incomes climb as much as 19.9 percent, according to an analysis by the conservative-leaning tax foundation. those in the middle quintile of incomes would see, at most, a 9 percent increase, the group said.      clinton is correct about the wealthy benefiting from trump tax plan      
__label__0 republican nominee donald j. trump complained in the spin room that his debate mic wasn't working right, according to a video posted by a cbs journalist. "they gave me a defective mic!" he told reporters. "[i] wonder, was that on purpose?" story continued below it wasn't the first time trump suggested he was given a faulty microphone. at a january rally in pensacola, florida, he abruptly stopped mid-speech and said, "and by the way, i don't like this mic." he went on to call whoever installed it a "son of a b-----", and said, "george, don't pay him! i believe in paying, but when someone does a bad job, like this stupid mic, you shouldn't pay the bill." in the debate, clinton accused trump of not paying several workers for their services. trump did not dispute that, saying, "maybe he didn't do a good job and i was unsatisfied with his work." trump has also said if he loses the election it's because the system is "rigged" against him.      trump: my mic was 'defective'      
__label__0 hillary clinton and donald trump quickly laid into each other over trade during the first presidential debate, with clinton citing her husband’s work on nafta as evidence she’s thought a lot about trade deals and trump calling nafta the worst deal “ever approved” in the u.s. “i think my husband did a pretty good job [on trade deals] in the 1990s. i think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again,” clinton said. story continued below “he approved nafta, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country,” trump shot back.the gop nominee has harnessed anger among working-class voters on trade this year — a strategy that garnered him massive support from blue-collar workers and even prompted other republicans who have supported free trade to flip their positions. clinton said that “we’re going to enforce the trade deals we have and we’re going to hold people accountable.” she continued by saying that the country “increased global exports 40 percent” during her time as secretary of state. “you go to new england, ohio, pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, secretary clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacturing is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. nafta is the worst trade deal maybe ever,” trump shot back. “donald, you may live in your own reality but that is not the facts,” clinton said to trump.      trump pins nafta, 'worst trade deal ever,' on clinton      
__label__0 “[trump is] someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers.”— hillary clinton “i never said that.” — donald trump trump did make such a claim. in a 2004 interview with nbc’s “dateline,” trump said pregnancy is “a wonderful thing for the woman, it’s a wonderful thing for the husband, it's certainly an inconvenience for a business. and whether people want to say that or not, the fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business.”      yes, trump did call pregnancy an “inconvenience” for employers      
__label__0 there were a couple of not-so-very-subtle signals here inside of hofstra university that donald trump lost monday night’s highly-anticipated debate against hillary clinton, and badly. the first was the audible sound of groaning by some of his supporters (picked up by my attentive colleague steve shepard) inside the debate hall as trump meandered self-defensively through a succession of answers against a very focused, very energized and very well-rehearsed hillary clinton. story continued below another tell: after the 90-minute sparring match finished, clinton’s team practically bounded into the spin room – more in glassy-eyed disbelief than visible elation that things had gone so much better than expected. the gop nominee’s people, by contrast, dribbled into the media pen like surly seventh-graders headed for homeroom the day before summer vacation. “f—k, let’s do this,” a prominent trump surrogate said before diving into a scrum. trump and his new-ish messaging team have labored mightily to turn the avatar of populist rage into a reasonable facsimile of someone who you could see sitting in the oval office. but this best-laid plan unraveled on monday – amid clinton’s steely assault and the dignified interrogation of nbc’s lester holt, who struck a deft balance between facilitator, bs detector and lion tamer. within minutes of the opening bell, clinton’s attacks forced domesticated donald to go feral – he bellowed, interrupted her repeatedly, grunted, and toward the bedraggled end, became muted and pouty. “it was bizarre,” said barack obama’s campaign manager david plouffe, who, like many clinton allies, seemed visibly relieved. “he was clearly rattled, and clearly focused on defending himself, which i’m told narcissists are prone to do, and he clearly faded at the end. it’s not like she’s going to jump out to a 10-point lead, but this was good.” whether or not this reverses trump’s momentum, or reestablishes clinton's control of the race is an open question. who won is not. here are five takeaways. trump was wimpy when defensive. he is supposed to be the big meanie but it was clinton who hit him where it hurt most. it doesn’t take a jung (or even dr. phil after a couple of bud lights) to figure out that the gop nominee – who boasts like a barfly – just might be over-compensating. hence, clinton, who started the debate a little tentatively, quickly launched into a carefully planned program of freudian mind-games, contrasting her own middle-class businessman dad (who had his own issues) with trump’s imperious, larger-than-life father fred who launched his son’s business career but also was said to be extremely tough on him. first she started in with a paean to her father’s running a small printing business in chicago (this might be the first time a candidate has described, in detail, the silk-screen squeegee process on a debate stage) – then she pivoted to mocking supposedly self-made trump’s start in the real estate business. “you know, donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. he started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father,” she said icily. “my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and i built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,” he responded weakly – and so it went on a range of topics. whether it was because clinton was so well prepped, and trump was so breezily unprepared – or had a simple case of opening night jitters – the bully-boy nominee abandoned his most effective mode of debate combat, answering an attack with a harsher one. she went right for trump’s ego – questioning his questionable $11 billion net worth, his boastful record on job creation and picking apart his tough talk on fighting isis. in 2007, preparing for a primary race she’d eventually lose, clinton told me that the key to presidential political campaigns was understanding that the most effective attacks weren’t about exploiting someone’s weaknesses but challenging an opponent’s perceived strengths. when confronted with that assault, trump wilted and offered a series of meandering answers that had his republicans wincing. “it was a draw,” former massachusetts sen. scott brown said. “but he was on the defensive far too much. that’s a direct result of his inexperience.” what about the clinton foundation? the former secretary’s debate team (including longtime aide phillippe reines, who snapped a pre-debate photo in a trump circled-finger pose) expected him to savage her on the various questions raised about her family’s foundation. they were worried about it. while he hammered her ever-so-briefly on emails, he was so engaged in self-justification, he flat-out forgot to pursue an attack that could have made the night a lot less lousy. his “30 years” attack worked – and he’ll use it again. trump may have lost the first debate, but he’s proven to be a fast learner, and is likely to come back stronger in early october for the second debate, a town hall style affair, in st. louis. and there were a few gold nuggets strewn in the wreckage of hofstra – the most valuable an assault (demonstrable and fact-checker-friendly) on clinton’s effectiveness in 25-plus years of public life. the been-there-not-done-that argument was particularly useful when coupled with his usual slams on bill clinton’s passage of the increasingly unpopular nafta agreement from the 1990s and hillary clinton’s election-year flip-flop from tpp booster to opponent. “when she started talking about this, it was really very recently,” trump said of her opposition to the trade deal. “she's been doing this for 30 years. and why hasn't she made the agreements better? the nafta agreement is defective. just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact.” when clinton claimed that she planned to “really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.” he scoffed, and shot back, “but you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years.” clinton effectively attacked his business career. trump’s attempt to head off debate-night questions about his five-year campaign promoting the birther slander against barack obama was a humbling face-plant. his attempt to pin the origin of the charge against clinton associate sid blumenthal was semi-effective with the political press, but it withered under the insistent interrogation of an african-american moderator determined to extract an apology or reasonable explanation. trump offered neither – and suggested obama should actually be grateful he pursued the canard because it’s now been resoundingly put to rest. politically, his tortured explanation helps energize black voters – who already oppose him in historic numbers. but later in the debate, clinton plucked the strains of what could be a genuine crossover hit this fall among ever-elusive white working-class voters and independents: trump’s failure to turn over his tax returns. clinton went there with a vengeance – engaging in a little trump-esque fact-free speculation about the motives of the billionaire developer-turned-reality tv star. “so you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?” clinton mused, with relish. “and i think there may be a couple of reasons. first, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be. third, we don't know all of his business dealings... or maybe he doesn't want the american people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.” trump’s answer did more harm than good: “that makes me smart,” he said – referring to his business, not his political, acumen. her most effective attack – and his worst answer. if the gop nominee needed any more proof that preparation trumps bombast in a general election debate, he got it when clinton launched a merciless attack on his habit of stiffing contractors who have labored on his construction projects over the years. again, clinton brought it back to her father, describing how bad he would have felt if one of his clients had accepted his work without paying his bill. "i’ve met dishwashers, painters, architects, marble installers, drapery installers, who you refused to pay when they finished the work you asked them to do,” clinton said, delivering a carefully scripted attack. “we have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. it's a beautiful facility. it immediately was put to use. and you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do.” this is a particular dangerous issue for a candidate whose entire campaign is rooted in fighting for the working class -- and his flippant response, yet again, gave comfort to his enemies. “maybe he didn't do a good job and i was unsatisfied with his work,” trump quipped.      5 takeaways from the first presidential debate      
__label__0 “by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since ronald reagan — i'm very proud of it.” — donald trump donald trump’s tax cut would actually be even larger than ronald reagan’s 1981 tax cut. trump's latest revision of his tax plan is estimated to cost between $4.4 trillion and $5.9 trillion, according to the tax foundation, or an annual average of $440 billion annually. by comparison, reagan's 1981 tax cuts reduced taxes by an average $200 billion annually (in 2012 dollars), according to the treasury department. some of those tax cuts were later rescinded when they ballooned the deficit. george w. bush’s 2001 tax cut had an average cost of $91.5 billion annually, according to a 2013 treasury analysis, while his 2003 cuts cost $84 billion annually.      true: trump’s proposed tax cut would be the largest since reagan’s      
__label__0 hempstead, n.y.—hillary clinton plays chess. donald trump plays craps. chess isn’t for everyone. it takes a long time. it's complicated. the chess team has a tendency to get beat up. craps is fun. it's thrilling. maybe you win big. maybe you lose. but in the moment, what a show. story continued below clinton’s campaign wanted the debate to make the many millions of people who watched think hard about each candidate as president—no matter what happens, “we win because more people are watching,” deputy communications director christina reynolds said two hours before the lights went up on lester holt. and they wanted a real-time test of their organization versus trump’s, both in a war room that drowned reporters in prepared emails and several times got so loud with cheers that aides missed parts of the debate and in a spin room that matched billionaire mark cuban, obama mastermind david plouffe and brigadier general john douglass against don king, wandering around in his mt. rushmore airbrushed denim jacket and american and israeli flags, and a couple of cable news talking head supporters like a.j. delgado. she moved in her pawns, her rooks, her bishops. he rolled the dice, shot them across the table. her gambits worked. “he was rattled that he had trouble competing in the arena,” said clinton campaign manager robby mook. “he became unhinged.” clinton’s campaign lined up this debate as the most important but just first volley in what will be a sustained attack through the second debate in st. louis and the third in las vegas. and her allies were immediately daring trump to try squelching on showing up for those, as he’s flirted with. even trump acolyte rudy giuliani was admitting afterward that it didn’t go well and her team is now hoping that will goad the republican nominee into another edition of blaming trusting aides over his own instincts, and coming into the next debate with a different demeanor. “it’s hard. we saw with al gore, we had three different al gores,” plouffe said afterward. “that didn’t work out so well.” her team sees a number of winning lines coming out of the debate to carry into the next: trump was a mess on birtherism (works with african-americans, and anyone who loves president barack obama), his answer on his tax returns could be interpreted as that he didn’t pay taxes at all in any year (works with middle class swing voters and any hesitant republican-leaning independent wondering what he’s hiding), he talked about his own business interests more than any jobs plan (works again with those middle class voters, particularly the college educated women that have been wavering a whole lot more than clinton can be comfortable with). but trump's appeal is to anyone who thinks flailing rage at the system is fine if that cracks a system that isn’t working. every time he seemed prepared with a line, it was to point out how long clinton had been around and not solved the problems she was talking about. “hillary has experience, but it’s bad experience,” trump said, finally getting across his point after the clock had already run past the 90-minute mark. clinton tried to keep the focus only on the flailing. her aides said he made that easier than they’d prepared for monday night. “he was baited even when you didn’t try to bait,” said clinton top adviser jennifer palmieri, who sat in on many of clinton’s prep sessions. trump’s debate prep was enough that he kept himself to calling his opponent “secretary clinton” instead of “hillary,” at least for the first half of the night, but not enough to hold himself back from yelling interruptions at her, or being caught prickly on her raising questions about the money his father gave him to start his business, and apparently unwilling to get a more convincing answer on whatever he wants to call his current position on birtherism. the clinton campaign and the obama alums, scarred from the president flubbing it in his first debate in 2012 against mitt romney, were horrified about a repeat, and with a weaker candidate. they walked out of hofstra feeling good. but the most important constituency that clinton may have hit on monday night: what rep. xavier becerra, spinning for clinton here at hofstra afterward joked are the “perpetual freaker-outers,” or nearing 100 percent of the democratic electorate who keep poll websites on constant refresh and have been cornering the market on xanax prescriptions as the national numbers have tilted more and more toward trump. “i don't think trump fell on his face, but she pushed back in a really strong and measured way—which i think is important,” said mitch stewart, battleground states director for obama’s reelection campaign, who was watching from home as a supporter of but not affiliated with clinton. “she also came across as friendly—much more so than trump. she was likable in this debate and maybe that is the most important thing for her to accomplish.” plouffe, who spent all his years with obama laughing off the “bedwetters,” laughed again monday night when asked if clinton had gotten them under control. “that’s a hard thing to fix,” he said. “did she give dems more reason to go out and knock doors? did she give some democrats who didn’t know if they were going to vote in this election, i think she did. but i also think she did quite a bit of good with moderate swing voters.” “she gave democrats a lot of reason to calm down,” plouffe said. “but that’s how we are.” “it was an awesome night for democrats,” said dnc member robert zimmerman, as he headed out of the debate space monday night. “there’ll be no bedwetting for 12 hours.”      clinton team celebrates a win      
__label__0 donald trump should skip the next two debates unless he gets special guarantees from the moderators, former new york mayor and top trump adviser rudy giuliani told reporters after the debate. lester holt, the nbc news anchor who moderated the debate, should be “ashamed of himself,” giuliani said after the debate. he said holt was wrong to attempt to fact-check trump on the constitutionality of stop-and-frisk and his claimed opposition to the iraq war. story continued below “if i were donald trump i wouldn’t participate in another debate unless i was promised that the journalist would act like a journalist and not an incorrect, ignorant fact checker,” giuliani said. “the moderator would have to promise that there would be a moderator and not a fact checker and in two particular cases an enormously ignorant, completely misinformed fact checker.” “if you wonder why donald trump thinks that the press is a left-wing basically oriented group, lester holt proved it tonight," he added. he later clarified about future debates: “i didn’t say what i’m advising him, i said what i would do.” trump himself had no problem with holt's performance. the moderator did a "fine" job, trump said. but giuliani was especially piqued by holt’s claim that “stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in new york.” “no, you're wrong. it went before a judge who was a very-against-police judge,” trump responded. “it was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. they would have won an appeal.” “stop and frisk is completely constitutional and the american people have been given the false impression that it isn’t,” giuliani said. a federal district court judge ruled in 2013 that new york city’s stop-and-frisk policy violated the constitution. mayor bill de blasio, who ran on a platform opposing stop-and-frisk, ended the policy soon after taking office.      giuliani: i'd skip next debates if i were trump      
__label__0 hempstead, n.y. — score round 1 for hillary clinton. that’s according to the politico caucus — a panel of swing-state activists, strategists and operatives who watched the first debate here monday night. the insiders’ bipartisan verdict: clinton dispatched donald trump in their first of three nationally televised meetings. story continued below overall, roughly 80 percent of insiders — with equal numbers of democrats and republicans responding to the post-debate survey — said clinton did the better job at the debate, including 99 percent of democrats and 57 percent of republicans. only 21 percent — 1 percent of democrats and 43 percent of republicans — picked trump as the winner. democrats said clinton was prepared and succeeded in provoking trump — who began the debate speaking so quietly the audio engineers struggled to raise his volume to a comparable level in the debate hall but quickly became more animated in the face of clinton’s attacks. “no contest,” said an iowa democrat — who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. “trump held it together for 16 minutes and fell apart.” “trump melted down,” added a florida democrat. “this is bad for him. [it] confirms all the worries of swing voters.” some democrats predicted the debate would swing the momentum, which appeared to be with trump, with public polls showing a tightening race. “donald trump exposed himself to be a clown,” added a new hampshire democrat, who also predicted “the polls will show dramatic movement in next 24 hours.” but a florida democrat countered that clinton’s performance was unlikely to change fundamentally the trajectory of the race. “it is becoming a base turnout election, and she did a great job tonight of making the stakes in this election very clear,” the democrat said. among republicans, the tally was closer — but that speaks to a divided party as much as actual ambivalence about which candidate performed better on monday night. “trump was an embarrassment,” an iowa republican said. “i'd hate to be the guy in the spin room lying about how trump won the debate.” “it wasn't close,” a virginia republican added. “sure, our tribal politics will force it to seem somewhat close, but even the most committed of trump supporters know, deep down, that did not go well.” but there was a significant share of republicans who thought trump won — most of whom said trump’s outside appeal could be the most memorable aspect of the debate. “hillary clinton sounded like every politician has sounded for the last half century. donald trump did not,” said an ohio republican. “this year that may just be enough.” “neither candidate earned a single undecided vote,” a nevada republican added. “clinton supporters will think she won. trump supporters will think he won. trump gets the nod because he did not completely implode.” here are two other takeaways from the first debate: clinton met expectations on monday night, while insiders are mixed on trump. the vast majority of all insiders, 88 percent, said clinton met expectations going into monday night. that includes nearly three-quarters of republicans: one florida republican called clinton “calm in the face of an insane person.” insiders were more mixed on trump, on the other hand. overall, 55 percent of insiders said trump met expectations: 40 percent of democrats and 68 percent of republicans. “there were no expectations,” said an iowa republican. “he got off to a great start, appeared reserved, but then he took the bait. the sneers and reactions when clinton was speaking undercut his first impression.” but for some republicans, meeting expectations wasn’t good enough. the expectations “were low,” said one pennsylvania republican. “he needed to exceed [them], and he didn't.” and a virginia republican said trump did little to appeal to a key group of republican-leaning voters whom trump is repelling this year: white-collar whites. “he needs college whites, and he didn't connect,” the republican said. republicans are divided on the political impact of the debate. gop insiders aren’t sure whether trump is better or worse off after the monday night debate. asked whether trump’s performance makes it more likely he wins the race, just 31 percent said yes — comparable to the 33 percent who said it doesn’t. a slim plurality, 36 percent, said the debate wouldn’t have a significant impact on trump’s chances. the debate was “not fatal, but very definitely a missed opportunity,” said one new hampshire republican. "neither of them made a persuasive case that they were more fit than the other to be president. at this point that advantages trump," said an ohio republican. “put plainly: he failed the presidential test,” a virginia republican added. “and hiding out on fox news isn't going to fix it for him.” but despite — or perhaps because of — trump’s unconventional debate style, some insiders said his message could resonate more than the pundits think in the immediate wake of the debate. “he spoke in a language that normal americans understand,” a virginia republican said. “america is looking for something different,” a colorado republican added. “he is very different.” and some republicans cautioned against reading too much into the first match-up. “there are two more debates to watch,” said a virginia republican. “trump has more he can adjust, [while] hillary is a fixed quantity as a virtual 30-year political incumbent. trump will be more aggressive in the next two debates.” among democrats, it was more decisive: 60 percent said the debate made it less likely trump becomes president, compared to 15 percent who said it makes it more likely and 25 percent who said it wouldn’t have an impact. “trump wasn't presidential,” a colorado democrat said. “he needed to show restraint, and he failed. tonight was his opportunity to show the country how he would govern, and he missed the opportunity.” these are the members of the politico caucus, not all of whom participated in this special survey: colorado: ryan call, laura carno, matt chandler, will coyne, adam eichberg, mark

__label__0 donald trump's presidential campaign website went down briefly approximately 30 minutes into the first presidential debate. it was back up shortly after 9:30 p.m. story continued below the outage appeared to begin shortly after both trump and his democratic rival hillary clinton encouraged viewers to visit their website for details of their policies. the hacktivist group anonymous tweeted a few minutes prior that it was "getting things set up" for the debate, but it was unclear exactly what the tweet was in reference to. anonymous has taken down trump's website before.      trump website goes down during debate      
__label__0 "for 30 years you’ve been doing it, and now you just started thinking of solutions.” — donald trump trump has said at least three times that hillary clinton has been working on trade issues, and other national policy issues, for 30 years. but as clinton said, it hasn’t been “quite that long.” in 1986, clinton was arkansas first lady, and her involvement on trade policy would have been limited at best. her first major role in national politics was as first lady, when former president bill clinton won his first presidential race in 1992.      trump is exaggerating clinton's '30 years' in national policy

__label__0 donald trump knows how to work a republican room. give him that. give him a gym packed full of yahoos wearing backward baseball caps and he’ll bring down the rafters. story continued below but give him a debate crowd where they let democrats and independents in, well, he doesn’t play so well. some candidates give energy to the crowds and some get energy from the crowds. trump is more of a getter. he needs the crowds. and when the people are not yelling and shouting and stamping their feet for him, he just seems to dry up. give him a crowd where the audience actually wants to hear what the two candidates for president have to say and trump is at a disadvantage. he is used to audiences that are already primed and ready. they shout the lines to him. they shout, “wall!” and he goes into his bit about building a wall on the mexican border. they yell, “benghazi!” and he goes into his bit about how hillary clinton was asleep at the switch. but it wasn’t hillary who was asleep monday night at the first presidential debate at hofstra university in new york. it was trump. he turned out to be a snooze. he needed to be an 11 and he turned in a performance that ranked about a 4. nothing he said seemed to work. "it's terrible what's been going on in chicago,” he said. “i have property there." nothing like keeping your priorities straight, i guess. he was so off his game that he didn’t even remember to bring up the wall or benghazi. maybe it was his health. trump had not been on stage for two minutes before twitter lit up with mentions of his sniffing into the microphone. which he did on and on. and was interrupted only by his sipping of water. and rubbing his nose with his index finger. a nonsensical “issue” to bring up when talking about the presidency? if so, why did the trump campaign make such a big thing out of hillary’s recent — and fleeting — bout of pneumonia? who knows what trump really has? if, like a lot of germophobes (he hates to shake hands, but campaigning has forced him to do so) he is also a hypochondriac, then his life must be a psychological hell right now. he knew this first debate was going to be tough. before it started i heard a tv reporter say, “arguably, this is the biggest night in modern american political history.” (one tip: whenever you hear a reporter say something is “arguably,” the answer is always, “no, it’s not.”) but it was sure to be important. and trump could have used a strategy that wouldn’t have cost him the millions of dollars he has been shelling out to the dopes around him. he could have studied up. he could have practiced. just a little. and the need for practice is hardly a secret. these 90-minute slugfests are difficult. it’s difficult just to stand up for 90 minutes, let alone stand up for 90 minutes and talk and make sense. hillary knew that. she is married to the best debater i have ever seen. and bill clinton practiced so hard for his presidential debates that he drove his staff batty. while most campaigns do mock debates to prepare, they rarely do full 90-minute mock debates every day. it’s just too draining. but bill would insist on full mock debates and then make everybody sit down and watch the debates on tape and evaluate every word he said and every gesture he made. so hillary did not just prepare for monday night, her staff told reporters she was “overpreparing.” and so how did she spend the morning of the debate? by holding a mock-debate. during the real debate, she hit virtually all her talking points. she didn’t hold back. trump, she said, had started his presidential career with racist lies over birtherism and “he has a long record of racist behavior.” there was only one argument, in fact, that i thought she blew. “i have met a lot of people who have been stiffed by you,” hillary said. “are they not owed an apology?” actually, they are owed more than an apology. they are owed money. roger simon is politico's chief political columnist.      trump needed to be an 11. he was barely a 4      
__label__0 hempstead, n.y. — the first 20 minutes of the long-awaited showdown between donald trump and hillary clinton appeared to be a draw. it was only later, when clinton began a barrage of possible explanations for trump's failure to release his tax returns and then sat back as he squirmed his way through an explanation of his history of birtherism, that her victory became clear. but it was rooted in those opening exchanges and a seemingly off-hand but actually quite deliberate decision by clinton to bait trump—by mentioning his father and challenging his own conception as a self-made man. story continued below “donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit,” clinton started. “he started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.” trump quickly dismissed clinton’s characterization, saying he received “a very small loan” that he turned into a company valued, he claimed, in the billions. “i say that only because that’s the kind of thinking that our country needs.” in the moment, he seemed calm—but from that point forward he was anything but. “she mind screwed him from the beginning by mentioning the loan from his father,” said rob stutzman, a gop operative in california. “that was brilliant psychological warfare on her part. he slowly unwound from there, culminating is borderline incoherency over the final 30 minutes.” suddenly, his words were dripping with sarcasm as he asked his rival if he could call her “secretary clinton—yes, is that ok? good. i want you to be very happy. it's very important to me.” his voice rose as he skewered her for flip-flopping on his signature issue of trade. and before long, he was interrupting both clinton and moderator lester holt, interjecting as she ran through allegations that he rooted for the housing crisis and claimed that climate change was “a hoax perpetrated by the chinese.” he remained on the defensive throughout, unwilling to apologize for—or dispute—accusations of stiffing contractors and paying little to no federal income tax. indeed, by the debate’s end, he’d again defended the years he spent refusing to recognize the u.s. citizenship of the nation’s first black president, showed no quarter on walking back his statements that clinton, the first woman presidential nominee in the country’s history, “doesn’t have a presidential look,” and spent the final minutes defending having once called rosie o’donnell a fat pig. for trump, who had appeared to pull nearly even with clinton heading into their first debate showdown before a super bowl-sized television audience, it may amount to a colossal missed opportunity. gop pollster frank luntz, who held a focus group of undecided voters in suburban philadelphia monday night, reported that 16 of the 22 participants deemed clinton the winner. if history reflects this debate as a pivotal moment in this campaign, trump, should he lose support and the white house as a result, will have only his own thin skin and scant impulse control to blame. but it wouldn’t be the first time trump was thought to lose a debate only to see his standing in the polls improve. indeed, while insiders and viewers alike handed the win to clinton, the republican certainly scored with his base when taking the democrat to task on trade. but that’s about all. before the candidates had cleared the stage, clinton’s surrogates were pouring into the spin room, eager to take a victory lap and to focus their comments on trump’s angry, animated performance. “he became unhinged,” robby mook, clinton’s campaign manager, told reporters. david plouffe, a top obama strategist, also noted trump’s behavioral change as the debate went on. “in the beginning of the debate, he tried to be sedated, straitjacketed trump, kind of on his best behavior,” he said. “and i think as the debate went on, we saw the donald trump all of you have covered: a little bit unhinged, a little bit rattled.” jennifer palmieri, clinton’s campaign communications director, used the same word—“unhinged”—in describing trump’s performance. clinton’s surrogates stuck to their talking points, including their denial that they had planned to bait trump into a meltdown. “we thought he would hold it together,” she said. “this is not the debate we mocked. we didn’t think this is what he would do; we thought he would come buttoned up, we thought he would be more disciplined.” but, in fact, clinton’s team had invested in psychological research as to how she might get under trump’s skin, according to two sources who said her off-hand reference to his father in the debate’s opening minutes was a deliberate calculation. plouffe, holding court with reporters, didn’t mention the research but explained the analysis, couching it as his own. “my analysis of trump is the thing he’s most interested in defending is himself—even more than winning the presidency,” plouffe said. “so any time his record’s challenged, his business record’s challenged, he kind of spends a lot of time on that. i think he spent a lot more time on himself than the american people.” after the debate, jason miller, trump’s senior communications adviser, cast clinton as “programmed.” campaign manager kellyanne conway said trump had been a “gentleman” for not mentioning bill clinton’s past infidelities. as trump’s staff was spinning hard, most republicans, from seasoned operatives watching at home, to close trump allies like rudy giuliani who let it slip in the spin rooms that the performance was “not one of his better nights,” concurred. “trump opened strong and hit some key themes that work for him. he won the early exchanges on jobs and trade, outsider versus politician, and presenting himself as the agent of change,” said bruce haynes, a gop consultant in washington. “but trump was not disciplined enough or prepared enough to carry those themes through the debate. trump found himself discussing sean hannity, sidney blumenthal and rosie o'donnell in a presidential debate. he was like charlie brown, he tried to kick every football that lucy held out there and he missed them every time.” after a dozen gop primary debates, trump’s former rivals were hardly surprised to see him so easily baited. “he refuses to let any criticism go unanswered,” said curt anderson, who guided bobby jindal’s presidential bid last year. “it's a conscious decision on his part. it's a bad decision.” they’d seen this trump before. we all have. just never on such a stage. annie karni contributed to this report.      clinton set the trap and trump walked in      
__label__0 donald trump enjoyed his strongest moments of the first presidential debate railing about trade deals crushing manufacturing jobs and then ripping the slowest economic recovery since world war ii. but when it came to his specific plans to make things better, trump came up short and ran into a details-obsessed opponent who shredded the gop nominee’s tax plan as a retread of tax cuts for the rich that would explode the deficit. story continued below democratic nominee hillary clinton even had a catchphrase handy to parry trump’s promises of a rocket-fueled economy: “trumped-up trickle-down.” if trump’s goal on monday was to put some serious meat behind his promises to ignite a sluggish economy and put clinton squarely on the defensive on the issue, he succeeded only sporadically. trump wasted no time in the high-decibel debate in blaming bad trade policies for a hollowing out of the american economy. “our jobs are fleeing the country. they are going to mexico, they are going to many other countries,” trump said at the start. “we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. we have to stop our companies from leaving the united states and with it, firing all of their people.” trump said his plan to cut the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent would “be a job creator like we haven’t seen since ronald reagan.” these kinds of appeals have helped trump draw nearly even in the presidential race and ahead in swing states such as ohio that have suffered the loss of well-paying manufacturing jobs that do not require advanced training. but when it came to laying out specifics for how he would create a renaissance in american manufacturing, trump ran onto rougher ground. pressed by moderator lester holt for details on how he would get jobs back, trump muddled through a digression on china devaluing its currency (it has actually been appreciating) and saying we have to “stop them from leaving.” exactly how was unclear beyond the imposition of large import taxes that many economists believe would spark damaging and possibly recession-inducing trade wars. clinton responded in part by agreeing with trump that trade deals should be better, ceding the offensive to the republican nominee at the start. but she quickly pivoted to a simple message: the economy is much better than it was when president barack obama took over in 2009, and slashing taxes for top earners is not the best way to fix what’s currently broken. “i think that trade is an important issue. of course, we are 5 percent of the world’s population. we have to trade with the other 95 percent. and we need to have smart, fair trade deals,” she said before launching into her first prepared zinger of the night. “the kind of plan that donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. in fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country, that we’ve ever had. i call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that’s exactly what it would be.” this was one of clinton’s top agenda items for the night: cut off trump’s rise with voters frustrated by the grinding nature of the u.s. economy and hungry for some kind of change of course, even if it’s delivered to them by an unconventional candidate they don’t really think is prepared for the presidency. polls consistently show americans view the country as on the wrong track and the economy as either stuck in the mud or getting worse. a politico-harvard t.h. chan school of public health poll out this week showed that 56 percent of americans believe the economy has stayed the same or gotten worse since the 2008 meltdown. the facts do not really support this, with unemployment down to 4.9 percent and incomes finally starting to rise significantly for middle-income earners. but many people still don’t perceive the economy as improving, something clinton also tried to address monday night, while also taking the opportunity to needle trump on his business record. “let’s stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. we had the worst financial crisis, the great recession, the worst since the 1930s,” she said. “that was in large part because of tax policies that slash taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of wall street and created a perfect storm. in fact, donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. he said back in 2006, gee, i hope it does collapse because then i can go in and buy some and make some money.” trump did not even try to rebut this assessment, just as he did not deny paying little or no federal income taxes for years. “that’s called business,” he said about profiting from the housing market collapse. clinton didn’t let up, diving again into her bag of statistics to rip trump’s tax plan by citing studies showing trump’s proposed corporate and individual cuts would “blow up the debt by over $5 trillion” and cost more than 3 million jobs. trump also did not have much of a response for this attack, pivoting instead to the increase in the debt during obama’s term and then simply stating: “i will bring back jobs. you can’t bring back jobs.” clinton tossed in a favorable reference to the 1990s economy under president bill clinton, which saw 20 million new jobs created, and rejected trump’s notion that clinton signing the north american free trade agreement was a disaster for the u.s. “i think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. i think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again,” she said. “incomes went up for everybody. manufacturing went up in the 1990s, if we’re actually going to look at the facts.” and on it went from there, trump offering bold promises and generalizations but looking very thin on how he might deliver them. the clinton campaign’s hope with these debates is that the remaining pool of undecided voters tempted by the thought of a major course change will look at trump’s lack of specifics — and clinton’s command of data and detail — and decide it’s not worth taking the risk. clinton also had a zinger waiting for trump when he ripped into her over her initial praise for the trans pacific partnership agreement. “you called it the gold standard. you called it the gold standard of trade deals. you said it’s the finest deal you’ve ever seen,” he said. “and then you heard what i said about it and all of a sudden you were against it.” it’s a potentially powerful argument for trump in the rust belt. but clinton was ready. “well, donald, i know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,” she said. “the facts are — i did say i hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated, which i was not responsible for, i concluded it wasn’t. i wrote about that in my book before you even announced.”      trump's economic pitch misses the strike zone      
__label__0 if i hadn’t seen the last fifteen months of this campaign, i’d have no problem in asserting who won this first debate on monday night. it was hillary clinton, whether the issue was the way she looked on stage, or got the better of donald trump in most exchanges, or her calm, somewhat more presidential demeanor. so what’s my hesitancy in proclaiming her the winner? it has to do with trump’s not failing badly. he did not show himself to be “unfit” for the presidency, which was clinton’s main accusation against him. in the countless other occasions—from his announcement speech on—the ordinary rules of politics would have decreed that trump’s campaign was wounded, crippled, dead. his supporters—and every stage in the campaign has showed them to be far more numerous than had been thought—do not hear him the way those of us who’ve covered campaigns do. the insults, the sneers? that just shows he’s the one person who can get up in the grill of the elites, the establishment, the people who have ignored us, ridiculed us, left us behind. and what of his lack of knowledge (demonstrated once again in his talk about nuclear proliferation on monday night)? it doesn’t matter, because he’s got the right instincts to upend a corrupt system. story continued below if he’s blustery, self-confident to the point of arrogance, dismissive of subtleties, then that’s a sign that he’s a bold, fearless advocate, as he showed again monday night. measured by that standard, did anything in this debate suggest that he is “unfit” for the job, as so many newspaper editorials and condemnations by traditional republicans have argued? clinton did bring up the 50 gop national security experts who have rejected him, but trump simply replied by citing a list of high-ranking military officers who are supporting him. and what of other standard measure? atmospherics? she was clearly happier to be on stage than he was; his water consumption suggested a subtle marco rubio impersonation. demeanor? it’s hard to imagine any of those wavering college-educated women finding his constant constant interruptions appealing. on the respective vulnerabilities? he launched one brief attack on her 33,000 emails and then … the issue went away. by contrast, she laid down attack after attack on his taxes, his business ethics, his treatment of women, and the “birther” issue, which he linked to outright racism. and his “defenses”—that he ”took advantage of the laws of the nation” in his dealings with contractors, in his explanation of his missing taxes—were somewhere between unconvincing and incoherent. it’s telling that one of his more effective segments came in talking about crime, when he argued that “the people that are most affected by what's happening are african-american and hispanic people. and it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.” moreover, her calmer demeanor enabled her to level some remarkably harsh attacks; calling his birther argument flat out “racist:’ charging he’d “stiffed” many of those who’d worked for him. (she managed a more human touch by noting how happy she was that her father, a middle-class draper, never worked for trump.) finally, at the very end of the debate, moderator lester holt confronted trump with his statement that clinton did not have the “look” of a president—a clear implication that this was a matter of gender. when trump tried to shift the ground to a question of “stamina,” a smiling clinton was ready. “well,” she said, “as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.” that worked very well. i have little doubt that clinton will be proclaimed the winner of this debate; by any traditional measure, she was. but if this campaign so far has proven anything, it’s that traditional measures have measured very little about what has happened. and i’m very leery about applying traditional measures to this debate.      this was the trump hillary wanted america to see—but did it work?      
__label__0 donald trump said hillary clinton has spent her “entire adult life” fighting the islamic state and will never be able to defeat the terrorist group. clinton retorted that trump "has no plan" to fight the radical group, and put him on the defensive over his past support for the iraq war. story continued below the foreign policy section of monday's debate touched on russia, iran, and nuclear weapons—but no subject animated the candidates like their exchanges about the terrorist militia's rise and which candidate is better-equipped to crush it. repeating a pattern throughout the debate, trump made his case with bold, and questionable, claims, while clinton defended her position with less memorable but more factual assertions. with polls showing high voter anxiety over terrorism, trump took the first shot on the subject early in the debate, with a charge that clinton's web site had posted details of her war plan. "you're telling the enemy everything you want to do," trump said. "no wonder you've been fighting isis your entire adult life." that was a head-scratching claim, given that clinton is 68 and the syria-based group, also known as isis, has only existed in its current form since 2014. (a predecessor group was founded in 2004.) but clinton ignored trump's puzzling assertion. "at least i have a plan to fight isis," she quipped. clinton later added that while trump has claimed he has a "secret plan" to fight isis, "the only secret is that he has no plan." clinton took more seriously his charge—supported by many national security experts—that the 2011 u.s. troop withdrawal from iraq had enabled isis's creation. "they wouldn't even have been formed if you left some troops behind, like 10,000, or maybe something more than that," trump said. president barack obama oversaw the exit of u.s. troops, which he celebrated at the time. clinton was then serving as obama's secretary of state. but she countered that it was the george w. bush administration which failed to reach an agreement with iraq's government that would have allowed u.s. forces to remain in the country on terms acceptable to washington. "george w. bush made the agreement about when american troops would leave iraq, not barack obama," clinton said. "and the only way that american troops could have stayed in iraq was to get an agreement from the iraqi government that would have protected our troops—and the iraqi government would not give that." experts have debated that point for years, with some claiming that obama never really wanted such an agreement and didn't try as hard as he could have to secure one. yet some some former obama officials—including the u.s. ambassador to iraq at the time of the withdrawal, james jeffrey— say that clinton argued internally for maintaining a troop presence in the country beyond 2011. isis evolved from the group al qaeda in iraq (aqi), founded in the wake of the 2003 u.s. invasion of that country. the group was nearly wiped out by the u.s. military but regained strength after the american withdrawal, and as it joined the fight in syria's civil war. in 2014, aqi cut ties to al qaeda and renamed itself the islamic state in iraq and the levant, and is often called the islamic state in iraq and syria, or isis. there is almost no expert support for trump's longtime insistence, which he repeated monday, that the u.s. should have seized iraq's oil fields as a form of war booty, and that doing so would have allowed the u.s. to prevent isis's rise. "had we taken the oil—and we should have taken the oil—isis would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income," trump said. trump has argued for years that the u.s. should commandeer iraq's oil, though he has not addressed basic questions like how many troops it would take and how the oil would be transported from a country sure to be hostile to the seizure of its most valuable commodity. nor did trump ever describe the plan in the past as a way to prevent militants from flourishing, even as many national security experts were doing so. clinton, who cast a senate vote to authorize the u.s. invasion of iraq in 2002, sought to turn trump's talk of iraq history back against him by citing his well documented comments in favor of the u.s. invasion before it happened. "donald supported the invasion of iraq," she said. "i did not support the war in iraq. that is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her," trump said. trump proceeded to claim he had "numerous conversations" with fox news host sean hannity, in which he opposed the war, but of which there is no public record. the debate's moderator, lester holt, endorsed clinton's version of events. "the record shows otherwise," he told an irritated trump. as he often has before, trump again cited an august 2004 interview with esquire as evidence of his opposition to the war. "they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started, i think in ‘04, but they did an article which had me totally against the war in iraq," trump said. but by that time, more than a thousand american troops had died in iraq, photos documenting the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal had emerged, and public support for the occupation was falling fast. clinton reiterated her pledge to "intensify" airstrikes against isis, enlist technology companies to track down on the group's internet activities, and support arab and kurdish fighters on the ground in iraq and syria—largely steps the obama administration is already taking. clinton did not repeat her past talk of establishing a "no-fly zone" in northern syria. clinton also raised the subject of russia, pressing her campaign's recent charge that trump is suspiciously respectful of russian president vladimir putin and that he holds kremlin-friendly views of nato and ukraine. "there's no doubt now that russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and i am deeply concerned about this. i know donald is very praiseworthy of vladimir putin. but putin is playing a very tough, long game here," clinton said. defying the strong consensus view of u.s. intelligence officials, trump cast doubt on russia's alleged role in the recent hack and exposure of democratic national committee emails. "i don't think anybody knows it was russia who broke into the dnc. she's saying russia, russia, russia. maybe it was. i mean, it could be russia, but it could also be china, but it could also be lots of other people," trump said. "it also could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, ok?"      trump presses clinton on growth of isis      
__label__0 it was a sober night monday for those whose debate drinking games counted on the candidates throwing around campaign buzzwords like benghazi, the border wall and the clinton foundation. while those issues dominated various phases of the 2016 run for the white house, none were uttered during the first presidential debate. story continued below hillary clinton may have been so surprised by the lack of mention of the benghazi attacks that she felt emboldened to actually allude to the tragic episode herself, arguing late in the debate that her ability to endure 11 hours of questioning from the house benghazi committee disproved donald trump's claim that she lacked the "stamina" to be president. moments after the debate, trump grumbled on twitter about topics he thought moderator and nbc anchor lester holt should have raised, but didn't. "nothing on emails. nothing on the corrupt clinton foundation. and nothing on #benghazi," trump wrote, in a tweet that did not mention holt by name. many commentators and some trump supporters noted that trump did nothing to raise allegations of improprieties involving clinton foundation fundraising or what the gop has alleged is clinton's failure to make sure the u.s. diplomatic compound in benghazi had adequate security at the time four americans were killed there in 2012. trump did bring up the ubiquitous email issue himself, saying he'd release his tax returns when she released 33,000 emails she deleted before turning a roughly equal number over to the state department in 2014. clinton says she no longer has those messages, but she never directly answered trump's question about why they were deleted nor did she respond when holt briefly followed up on the point. trump also failed to mention clinton's claim that about half of his supporters were "deplorables"—a statement she has withdrawn and apologized for. while trump lamented that clinton's vulnerabilities didn't receive much attention in the debate, some of democrats' hobby horses about trump also got brushed aside. allegations that the trump university real estate seminar program was a fraud that bilked participants of up to $35,000 apiece have been fodder for campaign ads and lawsuits and even led to trump's startling claim that a latino judge should be removed from the case because of his heritage. but there was no mention at all of trump u. monday night, nor of the controversy over the trump foundation's illegal donation to a florida political group or the foundation's unusual affinity for purchasing oversized portraits of its namesake. some of the world's most urgent crises, like the ongoing violence in syria estimated to have killed more than 400,000 people, got no discussion at all from the debate stage in long island. it could be that such subjects will get more focus at the second presidential debate, set for oct. 9 and expected to focus on global affairs. holt had announced three topics for monday night's debate—america’s direction, achieving prosperity and securing america—so one might have expected the latter to lead to a substantial discussion of immigration policy and the vetting of refugees, but those issues got only glancing treatment. the nbc news anchor never raised the immigration issue, but trump brought it up a couple of times. he noted, in garbled language, that he'd been endorsed by a union representing immigration and customs agents. trump also made a somewhat confusing reference to a recent department of homeland security inspector general report that found hundreds of instances where immigrants were naturalized without complete fingerprint checks that would have shown them to have been previously ordered deported. "we were deporting 800 people....these people we were going to deport ended up becoming citizens.....now it turns out it might be 1,500 and they don't even know," trump said. if foreign policy was to be left for another night, major domestic policy issues should have had a good chance monday. but another favorite punching bag for republicans—president obama's health care law—escaped entirely unscathed. some of the issues that holt didn't ask about, like climate change or obamacare, may have been on his question list. but he seemed to ask relatively few questions, allowing prolonged exchanges by the candidates and indulging trump's requests for rebuttal time. the issue of health care was almost completely bypassed, with the candidates making only the briefest references to it. clinton added "health" to the list of things trump wasn't supporting if he didn't pay federal income taxes in recent years. trump said one reason the u.s. doesn't have "new hospitals" is because the country has "squandered" money on many of clinton's "ideas." another touch area the candidates didn't delve into monday: clinton's health. trump did say he thought she lacked the "stamina" to be president, but he didn't elaborate and he never referenced her recent bout with pneumonia or the video of her appearing to collapse after an outdoor sept. 11 commemoration ceremony in new york. while the debate tiptoed around the health issue, many twitter commentators didn't. they noted that trump seemed to be under the weather, sniffling occasionally and sounding a bit nasal. perhaps trump passed up the health-related hit on clinton because he feared she might have a tart reply suggesting he was being worn down by life on the campaign trail.      what you didn't hear at the trump-clinton debate      
__label__0 lester holt was on an island on monday night. and for most of the first presidential debate, he stayed there, letting the battleships of hillary clinton and donald trump shoot their missiles at one another. it made for some memorable exchanges between trump and clinton, matched in close-up on most networks. for some debate watchers, that’s what they want their moderators to do: say "go" and let them run. but it also left some gaps where viewers probably expected sharp questions. story continued below there was no probing of trump’s wall with mexico, and vow to get the mexicans to pay for it, or the republican nominee’s ban on muslims entering the country. and he barely prodded clinton to explain her private email server in a question so gently worded that she was able to dispatch the issue with a few taut sentences. the clinton foundation? wasn’t discussed; neither was the benghazi attack. few moderators have faced such intense scrutiny in the days leading up to the debate as holt did, with clinton’s allies demanding he serve as a fact-checker and trump’s backers insisting that he allow the candidates to have their say. before the network broadcasts began, holt seemed to reveal his choice, telling the audience he wanted to “facilitate” the conversation between “just the two of them.” holt is often seen as understated. his arrival on the national stage was under the radar, as he quietly assumed the nbc anchor chair while brian williams’ career was careening to a halt, removed as anchor of “nightly news” over allegations he exaggerated his experience covering the iraq war. but during the debate, that understated approach sometimes led to the candidates, especially trump, rolling over his questions, with holt at one point admitting that they were far behind schedule. it started early, during the first segment about the economy. holt asked trump how he specifically will help put money back in the pocket of americans. trump offered few specifics, veering into criticism of clinton’s decades of public service without improving trade agreements. holt tried to interrupt but trump kept rolling. he managed, a few seconds later, to follow up, pressing for specifics. but the end of the first segment would lead some critics on twitter to ask “where’s lester?" "apparently lester holt went to the bathroom, way down the hall, and only one urinal is available and there is a line,” joked national review writer jim geraghty in a tweet. as clinton and trump sparred over debate and taxes, jabbing one another over and over again, holt kept trying to jump in. "let me get you to pause right there,” he said as trump was claiming clinton was going to “approve one of the biggest tax increases." "lester, that can't be left to stand,” clinton shot back, one of several times she asked holt to “turn back the clock” or step in as trump steamrolled through questions. when trump continuously interrupted clinton during her answers, holt would at most offer a pleading,"this is secretary clinton's two minutes, please." but holt’s understatement didn’t mean he was completely walked over. at different points, holt pushed back against both candidates. "last week you said we have to do everything possible to improve policing to go right at implicit bias. do you believe police are implicitly biassed against black people?” holt asked clinton. and as the debate went on, he became more engaged and pushed back harder against trump, on his birtherism, iraq war support and his taxes. when trump tried to assert again, falsely, that he was always against the iraq war, holt was sure to not step into the same problems his colleague matt lauer, who let trump’s claim he didn’t support the iraq war slide. initially, holt did not interrupt when trump barked “wrong” as clinton said he supported the war. but a few moments later, he came back. “the record shows otherwise,” holt said, later referring to trump’s 2002 interview with howard stern, which trump himself then later said that in the interview with stern said he said "who knows." the reaction from the media and pundits was mixed, though mostly positive. “[holt] provided some realtime fact checking but let trump go off on tangents and repeat too many proven lies,” said washingotn post media columnist margaret sullivan, giving holt a “b-minus” grade. "[holt] didn't make himself the story, and was dignified, if medium-weak and sometimes absent." former cnn washington bureau chief frank sesno offered: "i think holt has done an excellent job. has been firm and fair, called trump on statements more than hillary but spent most of his efforts steering the conversation / debate to the two candidates.” not everyone was not as happy with how holt treated trump. "has the moderator challenged clinton on anything?” tweeted the tax-cut activist grover norquist. “lester holt interrupted mr. trump more, he followed up with mr. trump more, he was much hard on mr. trump,” complained trump senior advisor boris epshteyn. "lester holt, to a degree, succumbed to the pressure form the left wing media and the democrats after matt lauer moderated the forum." hugh hewitt, the conservative talk show host, didn’t seem to agree. "conservatives should agree @lesterholtnbc did a very fine job moderating. he pushed on birther issue and iraq war but gave plenty of time,” he tweeted. trump himself seemed perfectly happy with holt’s performance. "i thought lester holt did a great job. ... i thought the questions were very fair,” trump told reporters in the spin room after the debate.      lester holt stays out of the way      
__label__0 donald trump interrupted hillary clinton 25 times in the first 26 minutes. he claimed she lacked the “stamina” to serve as commander-in-chief. and when the question of his attitude towards women became an explicit topic of debate, he seemed to allude to resisting the urge to use her husband’s marital infidelity against her. trump has been aggressive and crude with male debate opponents, too, and he addressed the former cabinet secretary by her proper title throughout the sparring. but, going up against the first woman to take to a debate stage as a major party nominee in american history, did trump come across as sexist? story continued below according to vox, he interrupted her nearly once a minute for the first 26 minutes of the debate. by 538’s count, trump seized the floor from clinton three times and lodged 24 interjections as she spoke, a total of 27 interruptions. clinton didn’t seize the floor from trump once, and lodged only 5 interjections. the pro-clinton american bridge counted a total of 73 interruptions by trump. the appearance of chauvinistic bullying can be deadly for a male politician debating a female opponent. just ask rick lazio, who sunk his 2000 senate bid against clinton when he left his podium mid-debate in an attempt to force her to sign a campaign finance pledge. trump has thrived by indulging his natural inclination towards aggression, but has also been tripped up on his attitude towards women and issues that matter to them – like when carly fiorina confronted him for deriding the appearance of her face and when he was forced to walk back a statement that women should be punished for getting illegal abortions. and the risks for trump are magnified. his opponents have consistently accused him of misogyny and his hopes in states like ohio and pennsylvania rest on suburban republican women who are uneasy with the choice. after the debate, the clinton campaign wasn’t touching the sexism question. “he has so much wrong with his performance tonight that something like that didn't even enter my mind,” said press secretary brian fallon. but others saw unmistakable chauvinism in trump’s approach. “first of all the interruptions, he talked over her numerous times, the way he rolled his eyes…that to me was indicative of the gender issue,” said former north carolina sen. kay hagan, a democrat. trump himself seemed to sense a potential trap when moderator lester holt asked him to explain his prior comment that clinton doesn’t have a presidential “look.” he quickly pivoted away from her physical appearance. “she doesn't have the look,” trump responded. “she doesn't have the stamina. i said she doesn't have the stamina, and i don't believe she does have the stamina. to be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.” clinton shot back by citing her diplomatic forays to hundreds of countries and the 11 hours she spent before the house committee investigating the benghazi killings. then she knocked trump for his treatment of former miss universe alicia machado, saying, “he called this woman ms. piggy. then he called her ms. housekeeping, because she was latina. donald, she has a name.” trump responded by saying, “i was going to say something extremely rough to hillary, to her family, and i said to myself, ‘i can't do it. i just can't do it. it's inappropriate. it's not nice.’” after the debate, trump confidant rudy giuliani said trump was restraining himself from calling clinton “phony as a feminist.” “this is the thing about donald trump is he has a big heart. he saw chelsea in the audience, and he didn’t say what he was ready to say,” said giuliani. according to the former new york mayor, trump was preparing to say, “you take money from countries that stone women. you take money from countries that imprison women. you take money from countries where women can’t drive. you take money – not money, millions and hundreds of millions of dollars – from countries that treat women as cattle. you attack monica lewinsky, saying that she was basically insane, when it turned out your husband basically violated an intern in oval office of the white house, disgraced the united states of america, and you were one of the primary attackers, and after your years with bill clinton, if you don’t know that monica lewinsky was telling the truth then you’re not smart enough to be president.” giuliani’s counterpunch aside, it was trump who faced more post-debate scrutiny on gender issues. republican women are crucial to trump’s chances, and those watching the debate fell into two camps: those who sensed sexism and those who felt gender dynamics were the least of trump’s problems on monday night. liz mair, a republican strategist who opposed trump in the primary, said he came across as “the kind of guy ever woman out there has rolled her eyes at and turned down flat at least a couples times in her life.” katie packer gage, another republican strategist who opposed trump in the primary said that the unscripted environment brought out the impulses that caused trump so much trouble before his recent streak of relative message discipline. “he has such a long record of demeaning and disparaging and bullying women that this is just a reminder of so many things that have been kind of forgotten in the last week because he’s sort of learned how to behave in proper company when he’s scripted,” she said. but other republican women saw it as a red herring. “i thought it was many things but not sexist,” said conservative commentator dana loesch, a frequent trump critic, of the businessman’s performance. “i think a discussion of stamina with respect to any sex is fair game when the context is commander-in-chief.” “for trump standards, he was fairly subdued. at least he didn’t call her fat and ugly and tell her her voice game him a headache,” zinged republican commentator ana navarro, who has sparred with trump this campaign season. to sarah isgur flores, fiorina’s deputy campaign manager, trump treated clinton the way he’s treated his male opponents. “hillary’s team would e making a mistake crying foul over trump being trump,” she said. “it can only take away from her performance at this point.” clinton’s performance aside, her face remained an object of analysis. while trump resisted the invitation to weigh in again on her physical appearance, fox news’ brit hume filled that gap for him. “the trump expression was one we’re all familiar with from the earlier debates – he looked annoyed, put out, uncomfortable,” hume said after the debate. “and she looked, i think for the most part, she looked composed — smug sometimes — not necessarily attractive.” gabriel debenedetti contributed to this report.      did trump come off as sexist?      
__label__0 when donald trump said he was hoping for a collapse in the housing market before the great recession, it was just smart business sense, he said in the first sharp exchange of the debate. “in fact, donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis,” hillary clinton said when discussing the recovery from the great recession. “he said back in 2006, ‘gee, i hope it does collapse because then i can go in and buy some and make some money. well it did collapse.” story continued below “that’s called business, by the way,” trump said, interrupting. but clinton talked over him. “nine million people lost their jobs, five million people lost their homes,” she said. clinton appeared to be referencing when trump, in 2006, said regarding a crash: “i sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy.”      trump cheering housing collapse: 'that's called business'      
__label__0 donald trump and hillary clinton clashed over how much help trump received with his business dealings, moments after the first presidential debate of the general election began. “you know, donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit,” clinton said, soon after the debate kicked off at hofstra university in hempstead, n.y. “he started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. i don't buy that. i have a different experience.” story continued below she went on to describe her midwestern upbringing, which she portrayed as middle class, needling trump in the process over how much he received assistance in getting his real estate career underway. but in the candidates’ first clash of the evening, trump insisted that he was given a much smaller advantage as he began his business dealings. “well, for one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and i built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars with some of the greatest assets in the world and i say that because that's the kind of thinking our country needs.”      clinton hits trump over '$14 million' from father      
__label__0 as congress careens toward a potential government shutdown, democrats are dragging the funding fight to the brink and hoping to squeeze the gop. the smart bet is still that congress will pass some sort of stopgap bill to keep the government running past friday. neither party wants to risk being blamed for a shutdown just weeks before the presidential election. story continued below but democrats are driving a hard bargain: they say any government funding bill must include federal aid to address the water crisis in flint. it’s a potentially risky move, but democrats are betting they can either force republicans to bend, or paint the gop as indifferent to the people of flint and responsible for capitol hill’s deepening dysfunction. "this funding measure does not contain a single penny for flint, michigan," senate minority leader harry reid said on the senate floor monday. "the people of flint, michigan have been waiting for emergency assistance to clean their poisoned water for more than a year." the senate is scheduled to hold a key procedural vote tuesday on a proposal introduced by majority leader mitch mcconnell. but that measure, which would fund the federal government through dec. 9, is expected to fall short of the 60 vote threshold needed to advance. the biggest complaint from democrats is that the bill includes $500 million to address flooding in louisiana and natural disasters in other states, but no money for flint, which is still dealing with the consequences of lead-contaminated drinking water. top democrats think it's a political miscalculation for republicans to be excluding assistance to a largely african-american community with high rates of poverty. reid said it was "callous" of sen. bill cassidy (r-la.) to refer to the calamity in flint as “other people’s grief.” one potential resolution to the impasse is for mcconnell to remove the money for louisiana. "is their solution now to remove help for flood victims?" mcconnell asked on the floor monday. "if their solution is to remove help for flood victims, they should say so." but democrats might accept that, reasoning that they could return in the lame duck and press for aid for both communities. in recent weeks, democrats have insisted that any aid for floods be coupled with aid for flint. mcconnell and house speaker paul ryan have been eager to show voters that republicans can govern responsibly and have downplayed the latest skirmish. ryan told cbs’ john dickerson in an interview that aired sunday that there would be no government shutdown. “i’m not worried about that,” he said. “this is the typical drama.” and top democratic strategists argue that the public has blamed republicans for past shutdown showdowns — giving them an advantage in this latest fight. “we see our leverage in getting flint aid as being the fact that republicans lose every shutdown fight,” said a senior democratic senate aide. “we know it. they know it.” white house press secretary josh earnest has said the president may not sign mcconnell’s bill and urged congress to act “without putting the american people and the american economy through another cliffhanger related to a government shutdown.” the white house office of management and budget has begun the earliest stages of preparing for a shutdown, holding a planning call with agencies last friday ahead of the end of the fiscal year. “the administration strongly believes that a lapse in appropriations should not occur,” said an omb spokesperson. “however, at this time, prudent management requires that the government plan for the possibility of a lapse and omb is working with agencies to take appropriate action.” a senior gop senate aide said senate democrats were intentionally trying to foment chaos. “they want to talk about shutdowns. they want to create chaos right before the election,” the aide said, adding that it was no coincidence the clash comes as republican chances of holding on to the senate majority have improved. republicans note there is much in the legislation for democrats to like. it includes $1.1 billion to combat the zika virus without language that would exclude planned parenthood-affiliated clinics from accessing federal grant dollars — a key democratic demand that had long snarled congress’ effort to counter the mosquito-borne virus. the bill also funds veterans programs and provides some money to implement a popular law signed in july to curb prescription opioid addiction. and despite a strong push from conservatives like texas sen. ted cruz and the backing of gop nominee donald trump, the bill does not include language to block the obama administration from relinquishing oversight of the internet domain system to an international body. it’s a “clean” bill, mcconnell boasted, with no controversial policy riders. democrats don’t fully agree. they are irritated that the legislation prohibits the securities and exchange commission from requiring corporations to disclose political spending. that provision simply maintains current law, making it harder for democrats to demand its removal since they permitted it in last year’s omnibus, but it offers them a chance to slam the gop as beholden to corporate interests. ahead of tuesday’s procedural vote to end senate debate on the package, aides were predicting the parties would remain largely united. sen. bill nelson, a florida democrat, has said he would support the so-called continuing resolution since it provides money to take on zika, which has spread quickly in the sunshine state. other democrats from states that would receive disaster aid in the bill, like west virginia sen. joe manchin, might also buck party leaders. but mcconnell can’t count on keeping all republicans on his side; sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.) said he will oppose the bill because it would not lift financing restrictions on the export-import bank. cruz and other conservatives might also defect. ryan and other republicans argue that any debate on flint aid should take place on water infrastructure legislation moving through congress. the senate passed that bill, which includes $220 million for flint and other communities with failing infrastructure, on a 95-3 vote earlier this month. but the house version of the water resources development act, which is set for floor action this week, does not include any money for flint. senate environment and public works chairman jim inhofe (r-okla.) has promised that any final negotiations on the bill, which would conclude in a december session, will end with flint aid. but democrats are skeptical after months of gop resistance. “i’m not going to accept, on faith, that if we leave flint behind in the cr, somehow there will be an epiphany between now and december, and what they oppose today, they will suddenly embrace then,” said rep. dan kildee (d-mich.). “nobody would buy that. it doesn’t make sense.” kildee noted that democrats will be crucial to helping house gop leadership carry any stop-gap spending bill approved by the senate across the finish line; many conservative republicans wanted a long-term cr to avoid a lame duck budget battle and are likely to oppose whatever the senate passes. the conservative group heritage action is opposed to the cr and is warning lawmakers it will include a vote on the bill on its influential scorecard. “harry reid is playing dangerous and irresponsible games with military pay, national security and critical services as he aims to shut down the federal government,” said rep. bill flores of texas, chairman of the conservative republican study committee. flores added that mcconnell was “caving in to this irresponsible behavior by surrendering important conservative policies.” seung min kim and anthony adragna contributed to this report.      democrats dig in with shutdown days away      
__label__0 donald trump and hillary clinton say they raised record amounts of money in august for their presidential bids — a total of $233 million just in one month. and wealthy donors are pouring millions of dollars more into outside groups involved in the race for the white house and senate contests. many of those groups, along with the presidential campaigns, are due to report the details of their late summertime fundraising and expenses to federal regulators on tuesday. here are some takeaways from the reports: —— trump manager super pac payment a firm headed by trump's campaign manager, kellyanne conway, received almost $250,000 from a super pac in late august, the same month the company also was paid $128,000 by the trump campaign, new documents show. the payment from make america number 1 to conway's the polling company was made aug. 23, more than a month after conway joined trump's team and almost a week after trump named her his campaign manager. that super pac is funded almost exclusively by conservative billionaire robert mercer, who had tapped her to lead the super pac during the primary, when the group backed texas sen. ted cruz. meanwhile, trump's campaign continued paying its former manager, corey lewandowski. he and the campaign parted ways june 20, yet his green monster consulting earned another $20,000 for "strategy consulting" on aug. 11, the same amount it had regularly been paid. ——— clinton spending spree clinton is spending at a faster clip than trump. the difference meant his campaign started this month with nearly a $10 million cash advantage over hers. clinton's campaign spent almost $50 million last month, nearly $12 million more than in july, including $33 million that went into advertising. she has blanketed the airwaves with thousands of commercials promoting her candidacy and attacking trump as unfit for the presidency. and clinton spent about $5 million on her roughly 800-person payroll. the campaign raised more than $60 million in august; clinton also helped raise another $81 million last month for the democratic national committee and state parties working to elect her. trump's campaign raised about $42 million and spent almost $30 million in august. like clinton, trump also raised tens of millions of dollars more for the party. ——— more big checks for clinton group apart from the campaign, which faces $2,700-per-person, per-election donation limits, clinton can count on several super political action committees to promote her candidacy. donors can give those groups as much as they'd like. the biggest one, priorities usa, continued to haul in money from wealthy democratic donors in august. the group raised $23 million last month. and it started this month with $41.5 million in the bank. nearly half of that came from a handful of big donors. slim-fast billionaire daniel abraham gave $3 million as did chicago media billionaire fred eychaner. combined, the two men have given the super pac $16 million this election cycle. democratic super donors — both billionaire financiers — george soros and donald sussman gave $2.5 million and $2 million, respectively, and emerson collective llc, a social activism organization headed by steve jobs' widow, laurene powell jobs, contributed $2 million. ——— democratic, republican fundraising the democratic party raised $29.4 million last month compared to $23.4 million brought in by the republican national committee. both presidential nominees have been working to raise money for their respective parties — which in turn devote resources to help their white house bids. despite the similar august fundraising totals, the democrats burned through far more cash, leaving the party with $11.5 million available as of sept. 1, compared to the gop's nearly $41 million. ——— senate cash billionaires are writing big checks to outside groups focused on the senate, the august documents show. the senate leadership fund, a super pac helmed by a former chief of staff to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, raised more than $28 million in august after months of slow fundraising. more than two-thirds of that haul came from billionaire casino owner sheldon adelson and his wife, miriam, marking their first major investments in the 2016 races. 39.3 the democratic counterpart to the group, the senate majority pac, raised $11.6 million last month. its top august donor was eychaner, who gave $3 million. close allies of senate minority leader harry reid direct the super pac. despite having been trounced in august fundraising, overall, the democratic group has nearly kept pace with the republican group, the reports show. but brace for a flood of new republican-boosting ads: the senate leadership fund began this month with $40.2 million in the bank. the senate majority pac had a little more than $12 million in available cash as of sept. 1. ——— nra for trump one of the most active outside groups backing trump, the republican nominee, is the political arm of the deep-pocketed national rifle association, which began september with about $10 million in the bank. "the nra — great people — they endorsed me," trump said at a rally tuesday in north carolina. the nra political victory fund reported tuesday that it raised $1.4 million in august, mostly from small donations, while it spent more than $3.9 million. the majority of the group's spending— some $3 million— was on television advertising opposing clinton, the democratic nominee, the reports show. according to the kantar media's political ad tracker, the group's ads have been concentrated in the battleground states of ohio, north carolina, pennsylvania, nevada and iowa. the new reports also show the nra set up pro-trump booths at gun shows across the country. ——— facebook money for clinton dustin moskovitz, a co-founder of the social media site facebook explained in an essay this month that he would spend $20 million to help elect clinton and other democrats. a chunk of that money — $5 million — showed up in the league of conservation voters' bank account in august. that made up the majority of its almost $6 million in august fundraising, reports filed tuesday show. nearly all of lcv's expenses last month were related to television ads opposing republican pennsylvania sen. pat toomey. the group is also canvassing and mailing out pledge cards and other materials backing clinton, filings show. ——— keep track on how much clinton and trump are spending on television advertising, and where they're spending it, via ap's interactive ad tracker. http://elections.ap.org/content/ad-spending —— follow chad day and julie bykowicz on twitter: https://twitter.com/chadsday and https://twitter.com/bykowicz      reports: outside groups spending big to help trump, clinton      
__label__0 u.s. secretary of state john kerry made an impassioned plea in front of the united nations security council today for all sides in the syrian conflict to live up to their obligations under a cease-fire agreement. the move may be the best chance for the u.s. to help bring an end to the violence, humanitarian crisis and displacement of thousands of syrians. kerry's determination to restore the cease-fire comes in wake of the most flagrant yet of the violations: two days ago, a united nations humanitarian aid convoy headed to opposition-held areas of aleppo was destroyed in a prolonged airstrike.     "on monday, 20 aid workers were killed in an outrageous, sustained, two-hour attack directed at a fully authorized humanitarian mission near aleppo — fully authorized," kerry told the security council this morning. "all of the permits had been given. everybody was on notice." u.s. officials believe russian aircraft, not syrian, were responsible for the strike but have yet to publicly accuse moscow. yesterday the white house said it could have been only russians or the syrian regime and that either way, russia is accountable for the strikes, given its leverage over syria and its commitments under the cease-fire. in spite of all this, rather than abandon the cease-fire, kerry today urged the syrian regime to adhere to its terms, calling for the grounding of all regime aircraft. "our purpose in this negotiation was to put an end to the kind of horrific and indiscriminate attacks that have been the primary cause of fear, of suffering, of displacement," kerry said. "and under our plan, all of this could be quickly accompanied by serious negotiations between the parties, aimed at a political transition and a conclusion to the conflict." meanwhile, the russians have released a series of conflicting statements in an effort to justify the strike on the u.n. convoy. they suggested at one point the convoy was accompanied by an armed opposition vehicle and most recently suggested the strike might have been carried out by a u.s. drone flying in the region. the u.s. defense department quickly denied that, saying it doesn't fly aircraft over that area of syria. moscow has yet to respond to kerry's request to ground all regime aircraft, but negotiations will likely continue through the rest of the week at the u.n. general assembly in new york. members of the international syria support group are expected to convene again in the coming days. "the future of syria is hanging by a thread, and i urge this council not to give up," kerry said today.

__label__0 first lady michelle obama has reacted publicly for the first time to the controversy over melania trump’s speech at the republican national convention in cleveland earlier this summer, when the gop presidential nominee’s wife was accused of using parts of obama’s 2008 democratic national convention speech. appearing on “the late show with stephen colbert,” obama was pressed by the comedian whether she feels any sympathy for the spouses of presidential candidates. while she initially signaled she did not have any sympathy for trump or bill clinton, colbert pressed obama by citing the example of the criticism surrounding the plagiarism episode. “melania trump was so criticized for using what turned out to be a portion of your speech. but do you have any sympathy? because there are people around her creating things, and i have some sympathy for her,” colbert said. “do you understand how that might be sympathetic for what happened to her?” “yeah,” obama finally admitted, clearly not amused by the continued questioning. “that was tough.”       colbert picked up on obama’s evident irritation, as she was not smiling, and quickly moved on to discuss her signature project, let girls learn, which aims to educate girls around the globe who do not have access to education. earlier in the interview, the first lady called her family’s final days in the white house “bittersweet.” “everything’s, like, the last, and i find myself choking up because we have raised our kids in the white house,” she said. “we’ve had so many amazing experiences. we have a phenomenal staff. we live in a house where people love us and care about us, and, you know, we’re going to be walking away from all of that.”      michelle obama on melania trump's controversial convention speech: 'that was tough'      
__label__0 the latest national presidential poll has some encouraging news for the campaign of democratic nominee hillary clinton, showing a 6-point lead for her over republican candidate donald trump. clinton received 43 percent support from likely voters in the poll, from nbc and the wall street journal, compared with trump's 37 percent. libertarian candidate gary johnson maintained his third position with 9 percent, and green party nominee jill stein trailed with 3 percent. in a head-to-head matchup, clinton's lead expands to 7 points over trump, 48 to 41. the margin of error of the poll is 3.2 percentage points. after the democratic national convention in july, polls showed clinton's lead over trump ballooning to upward of 10 points in early august before returning to tighter margins in recent weeks. surveys by fox news and cbs/new york times last week showed a spread between the two candidates within the polls' margin of error.     today's numbers give clinton her largest margin since aug. 31, when a fox news poll gave her a 6-point edge. clinton received more support than usual from registered male voters in the nbc/wall street journal poll. trump maintained higher levels of backing from the demographic, garnering 46 percent support to clinton's 44 percent, but the difference is much narrower than in earlier polls. in additional questions, respondents expressed concern about trump's words and actions on the campaign trail, with 69 percent of those surveyed reporting that they have reservations about aspects of his campaign, with 54 percent saying they have "major" concerns. specifically, 33 percent of likely voters reported dismay over trump's temperament; 27 percent said his comments about women, immigrants and muslims worry them the most; and 13 percent were most disturbed by his compliments for russian president vladimir putin. on the democratic side, clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state continued to bother voters; 64 percent expressed concern about the issue. abc's ryan struyk contributed to this report.      hillary clinton bolstered by latest national poll, leads donald trump by 6 points      
__label__0 in a bloody page in the journal purportedly found on ahmad rahami when he was captured, the new york and new jersey bombing suspect appears to praise major terrorist figures, including the main spokesman for isis. a reference to "brother adnani," presumably referring to the late abu muhammad al-adnani, is the first public evidence that isis, as well as al-qaeda, may have inspired rahami's alleged violent acts. "i looked for guidance and [praise be to god] guidance came. sheikh anwar[,] brother adnani ... said it clearly attack the kuffar [unbelievers] in their backyard," the page says. "sheikh anwar" is likely a reference to influential american-born al-qaeda cleric anwar al-awlaki, who was killed in a u.s. drone strike five years ago.       elsewhere in the journal, rahami purportedly praised al-qaeda founder osama bin laden and 2009 fort hood shooter nadal hasan, according to a criminal complaint filed against rahami late tuesday, which doesn't mention al-adnani. the pentagon said al-adnani was killed in a u.s. airstrike in syria in late august. before his death, he served as the primary spokesman for isis and often encouraged western muslims to conduct attacks in their home countries. "if you can kill a disbelieving american or european ... then rely on allah and kill them in any manner or way, however it may be," adnani said in an audio message two years ago. isis has not released any claim of responsibility for the bombings in new york, where 31 people were injured, and new jersey, where no one was hurt.      isis figure referenced in nyc bomber's purported journal      
__label__0 the senate cleared the way today for a massive arms deal with saudi arabia to proceed, after voting against a resolution that would have blocked the transfer of $1.15 billion worth of military equipment to be sold from the u.s. to saudi arabia. the bipartisan resolution was introduced in the senate earlier this month amidst increased reports of civilian casualties in yemen at the hands of the saudi-led coalition. sens. chris murphy, d-conn., rand paul, r-ky., al franken, d-minn., and mike lee, r-utah, who introduced the resolution, argued in part that by arming saudi arabia, the u.s. was complacent in these civilian deaths in yemen.       amnesty international said in a statement monday that a u.s.-made bomb was used in a saudi airstrike on a doctors without borders hospital in northern yemen that killed 11 and injured 19. while the humanitarian group expressed disappointment at today's vote, they praised the increased "voice of dissent" in congress regarding u.s. arms sales to saudi. "today’s vote is the latest example of the growing voice of dissent in congress when it comes to the united states’ selling arms to saudi arabia,” sunjeev bery, amnesty international usa advocacy director for the middle east and north africa, said in a statement today. “u.s. officials know that the saudi government continues dropping bombs on civilian communities and yet the obama administration continues selling it weapons. this arms deal is bad for the people of yemen, bad for the region and bad for u.s. foreign policy. president obama should cancel it immediately,” berry added.   on the senate floor today, sen. chris murphy argued that the situation in yemen, in addition to being an "ongoing humanitarian disaster," has also provided an opportunity for al-qaeda and isis to "grow by leaps and bounds." "but the scope of this disaster for the purposes of u.s. national security interests is not just the radicalization of the yemeni people against the united states, it's not just the thousands of people that have been killed, but the fact that this war has given, has given ground, an opportunity, for al-qaeda and isis to grow, grow by leaps and bounds," murphy said this morning, prior to the vote, on the senate floor. following the results of the vote, murphy said he was pleased about the message that the vote sent, regardless of the results. "never before have so many senators gone on record supporting a rethink of the us-saudi relationship. didn't win, but a strong message," murphy said on twitter, adding, "lots of senators who voted for the sale mentioned to me how good it felt to be openly debating foreign policy in the senate again." sen. rand paul echoed murphy's sentiments in a tweet, saying, "today we didn't just debate obama's $1.15 billion saudi arms deal, we debated constitutional principles and war."      senate votes to advance $1.15 billion saudi arms deal      
__label__0 as donald trump courted african-american voters in cleveland on wednesday at a town hall taped by fox news to air thursday evening, he seemed to express support for establishing the stop and frisk policing policy on a national level. when asked by an audience member how he would stop violence in the black community, trump responded, "i would do stop and frisk. i think you have to. we did it in new york. it worked incredibly well. and you have to be proactive, and you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically." he added, "new york city was incredible, the way that worked, so i think that could be one step you could do."       the law enforcement policy — in which police officers stop and question pedestrians regardless of whether they believe a crime has been committed, then search the pedestrians if the officers suspect violations — has been extremely controversial, particularly in communities of color, and has been the subject of several legal challenges alleging racial profiling and discrimination. the policy gained prominence in the 1990s under new york city police commissioner bill bratton and mayor rudy giuliani, who is now a close confidant of trump's. trump previously expressed his support for the policy, praising giuliani for its success in new york. trump has as of late also been an ardent supporter of profiling regarding immigration, believing it is a helpful tactic in stopping terrorism. he has drawn the ire of some african-americans not only for praising stop and frisk but also for painting a grim portrait of black life. on tuesday night, trump said, "our african-american communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before, ever, ever, ever" — seeming not to take into account slavery, institutional segregation or the often violent reactions in the civil rights movement. on thursday morning, however, in an interview on "fox & friends," he sought to amend his position, saying he never meant to suggest that stop and frisk should be implemented nationally. "now chicago is out of control. i was referring to chicago with stop and frisk," trump said. his initial answer came in response to a question that did not mention chicago, though trump cited the city in a previous answer as a place that is "out of control." of course, as president, trump would not be able to unilaterally implement the policy in a single city; he would have to defer to local officials and law enforcement. during a press conference, the members of the congressional black caucus were asked about trump's stop-and-frisk remarks. "the notion that stop and frisk had anything to do with the improving public safety numbers in new york is ludicrous, and donald trump needs to check his facts," said rep. hakeem jeffries, d-new york. "we would ask donald trump to bone up on his knowledge of what is constitutional and what is unconstitutional," said rep. yvette clarke, d-new york.      donald trump calls for nationwide stop-and-frisk policy, then rolls it back      
__label__0 while hillary clinton and donald trump prepare for their first debate on monday, aides in both their campaigns are expressing concern over how it will all go down. the trump campaign’s major concern: the candidate’s limited preparation. the clinton camp’s biggest worry: that the republican presidential nominee will be asked softer questions than clinton. “my biggest concern continues to be a low bar set for him on expectations,” clinton’s communications director jennifer palmieri told reporters during a flight to orlando, florida, today, referring to the debate at hofstra university in hempstead, new york, on sept. 26 — the first of three face-offs between the two white house hopefuls. “people accommodate the questions and lower the bar on their questions to suit the candidate in front of them, and that’s what’s happened with trump in the past. and they ask hillary clinton a set of much harder questions,” palmieri said. “they ask him a set of easier questions because he has not put forward detailed ... material you can parry him on.” her concern stems from what the campaign considers to have been unfair treatment of clinton during a recent nbc news national security forum that featured both candidates fielding questions from a moderator and audience members in separate segments. clinton has been preparing for the debate for weeks, and she has no public campaign events planned for the rest of the week so she can continue studying. aides say the former secretary of state — who is known for doing her homework — has been poring over briefing books and practicing in mock debates with a trump stand-in. she has been studying footage of trump’s past debates. from this, palmieri said, they believe the republican nominee tends to do better in multicandidate settings, where he can hang back and pick his moments. the campaign is also concerned about trump’s unpredictable nature. “you’re not sure who is going to show up. he may be aggressive or laid back,” palmieri said. and while it is common for campaigns to lower expectations before debates and other high-profile events, sources told abc news that trump’s preparation for the 90-minute one-on-one battle has been slim — so much so that his senior staff has become concerned about his lack of focus. while trump has boasted that he will win monday’s debate, senior sources said he has not delved into policy or participated in mock debates. during his sunday meetings in bedminster, new jersey — where he huddles with campaign chief steve bannon, campaign manager kellyanne conway, roger ailes and other advisers, including members of his family — the prep has become more of a discussion of topics and themes and not specific in nature. (those sessions often become storytelling sessions rather than actual, intense preparation, according to senior sources.) trump, sources said, was given an ipad loaded with footage of old clinton debates. unlike clinton, who is spending almost the entire rest of the week preparing for monday, trump has a busy campaign schedule this week, with no large blocks of time carved out for debate prep. aides said his debate sessions planned for this weekend have been moved to trump tower in new york city, away from his bedminster estate and golf course, to help him focus. the trump campaign recently added a saturday evening event in roanoke, virginia. abc news’ tom llamas and john santucci contributed to this report.       what's worrying hillary clinton's and donald trump's campaigns before the first debate      
__label__0 former president bill clinton slowly walked toward the podium, newly repositioned at the center of the stage under the spotlight. he diligently thumbed through the pages of a farewell defense, which he had been working on moments before he addressed the clinton global initiative one final time. “it’s been one of the great honors of my life,” clinton said as he addressed crowd. “you are living proof that good people committed to creative cooperation have almost unlimited positive impact to help people today and give our kids better tomorrows. now, i have spent the last 15 years of my life working to advance that idea.”   emails released by the state department show that some clinton foundation donors received meetings with then-secretary of state hillary clinton, which prompted republican presidential nominee donald trump to accuse the clinton foundation of being a “pay for play” organization.       but bill clinton today shied away from engaging in the politics surrounding his foundation and instead used his platform as an attempt to change the negative narrative that has been seen as a liability to his wife’s presidential bid. clinton proudly recalled trips around the world, partnering with governments, corporations and influential people to deliver hiv/aids medication, fight childhood obesity and provide homes for haitian families following the devastating 2010 earthquake, among countless other initiatives. the cgi annual meeting runs at the same time at the united nations general assembly, hoping to attract world leaders who can only attend if they pledge to commit to a cause. “everybody who comes has to actually make a commitment to do something to make the world a better place. we won’t say there’s a minimum dollar amount, we won’t say there’s a minimum time amount, but they got to do something,” explained the former president. and then he joked, “and i thought we’re about to have a meeting and nobody will come.” attendance at the annual meeting has dragged a bit since hillary clinton announced her presidential bid, as some donors have tried to keep space between the clinton foundation and her run for president. in previous years, president barack obama has attended and presidential candidates on both sides have come, but not this year. but bill clinton did not allow the scrutiny to keep him from giving cgi members a charge to continue their work, even if it would be without him. “don't give up on what brought you here. you have done something good and noble and worthy and it’s all just beginning,” said the former president. “if we embrace our common humanity over our interesting differences and get up tomorrow in knowing that just if we get caught trying and we do it with somebody else, chances are it will work out better than it ever dreamed. cgi worked out better than i ever dreamed.” today’s meeting was the twelfth and final cgi convocation, and bill clinton announced last month that he would resign from the board of the clinton foundation if hillary clinton wins the presidential election.      bill clinton calls clinton global initiative 'one of the great honors of my life' in final speech      
__label__0 donald trump and his children have for years promoted themselves and their real estate opportunities in russia and other former soviet states, and ethics experts say if he is elected president the get-tough u.s. sanctions against russia could be in direct conflict with his business interests. trump has said he will not participate in decisions about his business if he is elected to the white house and that those decisions will be left to his children in what they have called a “blind trust.” but richard painter, a university of minnesota law professor who served as ethics advisor to republican president george w. bush, said the arrangement would not fit his definition of a blind trust, and appeared ripe for potential conflicts. “i don’t see how you have a blind trust when you know what’s in the blind trust,” painter told abc news. “the appearance is that a foreign government or other foreign organization has influence over the president of the united states through financial dealings with his family and that would be unacceptable.” as questions have been raised about trump’s business interests with russians, the candidate has sought to distance himself from moscow. “for the record, i have zero investments in russia,” he wrote on twitter in july. he later told abc’s george stephanopoulos, “will i sell condos to russians on occasion? probably. i mean i do that. i have a lot of condos. i do that. but i have no relationship to russia whatsoever." but an abc news investigation found he has numerous connections to russian interests both in the u.s. and abroad. “the level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars -- what he received as a result of interaction with russian businessmen,” said sergei millian, who heads a u.s.-russia business group and who says he once helped market trump’s u.s. condos in russia and the former soviet states. “they were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with donald trump. and they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with donald trump.” questions about trump’s posture towards russia have been a recurring issue in the 2016 presidential campaign. they have come from democrats and republicans, many of whom expressed surprise at trump’s flattering remarks about russian president vladimir putin, even as the official u.s. stance has grown increasingly frosty. “i would treat vladimir putin firmly, but there’s nothing i can think of that i’d rather do than have russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now so that we can go and knock out isis together with other people and with other countries,” he said.   sen. john mccain told a talk radio audience he was “astonished” after trump praised putin on the campaign trail. “i think [it] shows either profound ignorance or an attitude that contradicts everything about the united states of america and our relations with our adversaries,” mccain said.  long before he ran for president, trump displayed an ongoing interest in russia and the former soviet states. he negotiated projects in the republic of georgia and azerbaijan, neither of which was completed. and he and his children at different times toured moscow in search of a site for a trump project there. “i know there were some drafts prepared for the [moscow real estate] project when donald trump flew to moscow. and he shared those drafts with some of the russian businessmen,” millian said, adding, “it didn't go any further at the moment.” trump was involved in a range of deals with russian-born business executives, including the developer of the trump project in toronto. one of his partners in trump soho recruited financing from investors in russia and kazakhstan, according to court filings. and in 2013, trump earned a cut of the proceeds when a russian oligarch paid to host the miss universe pageant at his venue in moscow.   at the same time, wealthy russians accounted for significant profits at trump projects in the u.s.. throughout the 2000s, records show russians were buying into trump branded real estate. abc news conducted a review of hundreds of pages of property records and found that trump-branded developments catered to large numbers of russian buyers. this was most notable at the trump licensed condo towers in hollywood and sunny isles, florida. local real estate agents credited the russian migration for turning the coastal miami community into what they called “little moscow.” trump organization general counsel alan garten told abc news the firm does not track the nationality of buyers, but he does not believe russians spent any more money on trump ventures than those from other regions. “this whole fascination with this connection is overblown and misleading,” garten said. garten said the trump organization played no part in determining which market to pursue – the strategy used to attract buyers was entirely the purview of the developer. “in a license deal we’re not selling the unit,” garten added. “that is a contact between the developer of that project and the buyer. we’re not selling anyone anything.” in the case of the trump towers along florida’s coast, they were sold by two separate builders with trump licensing his name to the projects. but the licensing agreements required trump to participate in the marketing of the condos, and trump received royalties for each unit sold, according to gil dezer, president of dezer development, which built six trump buildings in sunny isles. “he [trump] obviously benefits from each apartment sold,” dezer said. “there was a licensing percentage there.” dezer described trump’s hands-on approach to the projects, with involvement in every detail of the construction. “he would come in and he knew exactly what he would want,” dezer said.  there is ample evidence in russian media from that period in the 2000s that brokers mounted a significant effort to attract buyers to trump properties in florida, toronto and new york. and trump and his children participated in those campaigns. during the marketing of the trump soho project, in which trump licensed his name to a group that included russian investors, the trump family met with a group of russian journalists at their new york offices to help boost interest in the project, according to russian media reports. during the meeting, trump was quoted telling the gathering of russian journalists: “i really like vladimir putin. i respect him. he does his work well. much better than our bush.” eric trump and donald jr. were also present, and were quoted praising the importance of russian condo buyers, many of whom have purchased units in trump buildings in seven-figure, cash-only deals. "as the experience of the past few years shows, the best property buyers now are russian,” eric trump is quoted as saying. “they're different in that they can go around without a mortgage loan from american banks, that require income checks and they can buy apartments with cash.” garten said the trump organization did not fly russian journalists to new york to tout the soho project, or any other. “if such a trip took place it would have likely been arranged by the developer or the broker for the project - not us,” he said.  victoria shtainer, a new york real estate agent who specializes in the high-end market, said the interest from russian buyers rose in the early 2000s as russians started to accrue wealth and began looking for a safe place to move their money. “they felt that the united states is a place where they could park their money and have their children go to school and have a future here,” she said. “america has always been the dream.” advertisements began appearing in russian media. real estate agents marketing trump projects showed glossy photos of the florida oceanfront properties, such as one licensed development called trump hollywood. “an exclusive location on the gold coast,” read the russian subtitles on one online video. “excellence is felt in every look and every touch.” daniel pansky, a florida broker who specializes in russian buyers, said the trump branded was uniquely suited to russian buyers, who equated his name with luxury. as sales piled up, “sunny isles developed into a little moscow,” he said. “a lot of local dry cleaners, restaurants, stores having menus and signs in russian.” “the trump brand basically started the branding game here in south florida,” said pansky. “the majority of clientele were from new york and russian origin.” but pansky and shtainer told abc news that purchases from russian buyers in new york and miami began to drop precipitously in 2014, when the u.s. imposed economic sanctions on russia in response to the russian military incursion into crimea. to russian buyers looking to move money out of their home country, shtainer explained, the sanctions “basically cut off their oxygen.”  should trump come out on top in the elections in november, he has said he'll consider whether or not to lift sanctions on russia. “we’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking,” trump responded in july when asked if he would roll sanctions back. hope hicks, a spokesperson for the trump campaign, said the republican nominee has "never issued a position on the matter one way or another" and reiterated that he would be studying the issue. trump's children said that if their father becomes president, they would abide by the "blind trust" and not talk business with him. “and we'll act incredibly responsibly and my father already said that he would put the company into a blind trust and it would be run by us,” ivanka trump told abc news last week. donald trump jr. said his father would not be told about their deals: “we're not going to discuss those things. we're just, it doesn't matter. trust me.” millian said he hopes trump continues to pursue closer ties between the u.s. and russia. he recently posted a trump donation card on his instagram feed. “he knows that a lot of russians love his properties,” millian said. “they buy his luxury residences. so it was a good, very good business for him.” abc news' randy kreider, cho park, and alex hosenball contributed to this report.      from russia with trump: a political conflict zone      
__label__0 the house oversight and government reform committee voted 19-15 today to hold hillary clinton's former it staffer in contempt of congress. for the second time in two weeks, bryan pagliano, former senior adviser for information resource management at the state department, failed to show up to a hearing to testify on the preservation of state department records. pagliano was the it staffer who set up clinton's private email server during her time as secretary of state. on sept. 13, pagliano did not show up to testify before the committee despite being subpoenaed. after his chair was vacant again at today's hearing, rep. jason chaffetz, r-utah and chairman of the committee, held a vote to hold pagliano in contempt of congress for his refusal to comply with a subpoena issued by the committee.     the vote passed 19 to 15, split along party lines. the resolution will now travel to the house floor. chaffetz argued that pagliano is a key witness in the investigation into clinton's use of a private email server to conduct government business. the chairman asserted that pagliano had no reason not to appear before the committee because he would not be subject to criminal liability due to immunity granted by the department of justice. but rep. elijah cummings, d-maryland, vigorously defended pagliano’s decision not to show up, saying that the committee had harassed him by sending u.s. marshals to his workplace with the subpoena. “i simply cannot vote for a resolution that is potentially so unethical,” cummings said. cummings has continuously charged that the hearings related to clinton's email server are political in nature.  rep. stephen lynch, d-massachusetts, feared that the committee was trying to embarrass pagliano. "the chairman is saying that his rule is that the witness has to come before the committee and be subjected to what the witnesses were subjected to last week," lynch said, later adding, "we’re continuing to try to embarrass this particular witness.” pagliano’s lawyer, mark macdougall, has said that if his client were brought before the committee, he would plead the fifth amendment. pagliano previously pleaded the fifth amendment in september 2015 when he was called before the congressional committee investigating the attack in benghazi, libya, that resulted in the deaths of ambassador chris stevens and three other americans. contempt of congress is defined in statute 2 u.s.c.a. § 192 and is punishable by a maximum $1,000 fine and up to 12 months of imprisonment. in 2014, the house voted to find former internal revenue service official lois lerner in contempt of congress and adopted a resolution calling on attorney general eric holder to appoint a special counsel to investigate the irs targeting scandal. but federal prosecutors never prosecuted lerner, instead determining she did nothing wrong by refusing to testify before the house oversight and government reform committee.      house committee votes to hold clinton it staffer in contempt of congress      
__label__0 less than a day after protests over the police killing of an african-american man turned violent in north carolina, republican presidential nominee donald trump placed some of the blame for the turmoil on the impact of drugs. "if you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night," said trump in a speech to the shale insight 2016 conference in pittsburgh today. on wednesday night, charlotte experienced its second night of protests after the death of keith lamont scott on tuesday afternoon. officers in riot gear confronted demonstrators in a downtown commercial area and employed tear gas to control crowds. one person is in critical condition after suffering an apparent gunshot wound. the republican nominee condemned the violence, calling for unity. "our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world's leader. how can we lead when we can't even control our own cities? we honor and recognize the right of all americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate, but there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others." he continued to praise law enforcement officers, citing the challenges they face and calling for better training. "it's tough being a police officer," trump said. "police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure that they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always — and it will be by them — vigorously addressed."     but aside from that one reference, amid his heavy-handed praise for law enforcement and condemnation of protesters, trump never acknowledged any pattern of violence against african-americans at the hands of police, which is precisely why so many protesters say they have taken to the streets. they cite the shooting deaths of dozens of other black americans by police as cause to protest a system they say is dangerous and discriminatory and fails to prosecute far too many officers who kill african-americans, in many instances unarmed. trump in recent days has appealed to black americans, asking them what they have to lose by voting for him, even as he paints an exceptionally grim portrait of black poverty and crime. during a rally earlier this week in north carolina, trump said, "we're going to rebuild our inner cities because our african-american communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. ever, ever, ever," many african-americans have bristled at that broad assertion. while many inner cities are plagued by crime and poverty, according to census data from 2015, 52.9 percent of black americans age 25 or older hold some sort of college degree. a pew report released in december shows that black adults experienced the largest income increase from 1971 to 2015 and were the only racial group to see a decrease in the percentage of low-income earners. and according to the census bureau, almost 73 percent of black americans do not live in poverty. trump, in an effort to reach out to the black community, visited cleveland earlier this week, appearing at a black church. and during a town hall on the fox news channel wednesday night, he was asked about the threat of violence. "i would do stop and frisk. i think you have to," said trump.

__label__0 former massachusetts governor and 1988 presidential candidate michael dukakis knows a little something about unpredictable election cycles and over-preparing for debates. he spoke to abc’s jonathan karl and rick klein this week on the “powerhouse politics” podcast and the topic of hillary clinton's extensive debate preparation came up. she has reportedly spent the past couple of weeks surrounded by advisers and briefing books, leaving the campaign trail in favor of mock debates. dukakis advised the clinton campaign to spend less time preparing for debates on topics she already knows well, because the real winner of the election would be, in his opinion, the campaign with the strongest field organization. “this is not the first time you’ve done this,” dukakis said of clinton, noting that most political debaters have had years of practice. “and sure, it’s very important, but lots of other things are important in campaigns. including your field organization and the people that are working for you.” he advised clinton to focus more on dealing with trump's unorthodox approach to debating. "you've got to be spontaneous, feel spontaneous. it's going to be interesting to see how she deals with the trump style," he said. in his own campaign 30 years ago, dukakis, who was the longest-serving governor of massachusetts, had a 17-percentage-point lead over republican presidential nominee george h.w. bush after the democratic national convention. by the second presidential debate, held at ucla, he came off to voters as unfeeling when responding to a question about the death penalty and his wife. cnn's bernard shaw asked, “governor, if kitty dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?” when dukakis responded instantly, “no, i don’t, bernard. and i think you know that i’ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life,” reporters and voters were shocked. he cited the inefficacy of the death penalty, but the public saw his response as cold. he told klein and karl on "powerhouse politics" that he found the question fair, and didn't realize how he had done in the debates until someone else told him later. he cited his own over-preparation as the reason for this second debate flop. in this case, his logical and formulaic response did not prevail over the show of emotion that spectators were expecting. in the end, clinton’s main challenge and focus should be on persuading voters to truly evaluate their opinion of trump, he said. “this guy has no business being president of the united states," he added. this episode of abc news' "powerhouse politics" podcast is available on itunes, stitcher, google play and tunein.      michael dukakis gives debate advice to hillary clinton      
__label__0 donald trump has praised the policing tactic known as “stop and frisk” on the campaign trail, but the controversial technique has a questionable history in new york city. the stop-question-and-frisk program entails nypd officers’ randomly stopping people on the street, on the theory that such searches help law enforcement identify people with illegal handguns and deter crime. supporters credit the program with helping to push down homicides and other major crimes in new york city to historic lows, but opponents have another description: racial profiling. a federal judge in new york ruled in 2013 that the program was unconstitutional and violated the rights of minorities because they were being disproportionally targeted by the practice. between 2003 and 2015, for instance, more than half of those who were subjected to searches were black and about 30 percent of the other searches were of latinos, according to an analysis of new york police department records by the new york civil liberties union. the nypd stopped the most new yorkers in 2011 -- 685,724 – before the number dropped to 532,911 in 2012 and 191,558 in 2013, the year when the federal ruling was handed down.       the number of reported stops then dropped dramatically to 45,787 in 2014 and 22,939 last year, according to the figures analyzed by the nyclu. "tactics like stop and frisk or tactics that utilize race-based profiles are ineffective because they don’t differentiate between those in the community who may be involved in criminal activity and those who are simply residents in the community,” professor john cohen of the rutgers university school of criminal justice said. "so what tends to happen is you tend to have a greater number of confrontational police interactions with members of the community who are not involved in any type of illegal activity. that not only is ineffective operationally but it also tends to cause tension between those members of the community who are the people you want to have good relationships with,” cohen, an abc news consultant, former police officer and former acting homeland security undersecretary, added. the nypd records analyzed by the nyclu note that the number of people who were completely innocent account for 80 to 90 percent of the searches. "it’s not helping you in the short run because your officers are spending time with people who aren’t involved in criminal activity,” cohen said. trump, who has calls himself the “law and order candidate,” has lauded the nypd “stop and frisk” program on the campaign trail, saying in ohio wednesday the program “was incredible, the way that worked.” when asked by an african-american audience member at the fox news town hall event about how he would stop violence in the black community, trump said, "i would do stop and frisk. i think you have to. we did it in new york. it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.” but his praise may not sit well with many african-american voters, whom trump has been actively courting in recent weeks. cohen said, "the reason why african-americans and other minority members will react negatively to his comments on stop and frisk is because many african-americans and latinos equate stop and frisk with racial profiling and, from a law enforcement perspective, racial profiling is operationally ineffective and unconstitutional.” rep. hakeem jeffries, d-ny, took issue with trump's suggestion today when asked about it during a news conference for the congressional black caucus. "for years 'stop, question and frisk' was implemented in new york and it had nothing to do with the decline in crime," jeffries said. "the notion that stop and frisk had anything to do with the improving public safety numbers in new york is ludicrous and donald trump needs to check his facts," he said.      donald trump's praise of 'stop and frisk' at odds with court ruling

__label__0 a group of senate democrats have asked the u.s. department of labor to open an investigation into whether wells fargo violated the fair labor standards act (flsa). the letter follows a hearing on capitol hill this week that saw bank ceo john stumpf face blistering questions from senators over a scandal involving allegations from regulators that employees opened accounts without customers' knowledge or permission. separately, stumpf resigned from his position on the federal advisory council effective today, the san francisco federal reserve bank told abc news. the council generally meets with the federal reserve four times a year to advise it on banking and economic issues.     the flsa establishes standards for wage, overtime, youth employment and record-keeping for both the private and public sector, according to the dol's website. among other stipulations, the flsa mandates that non-exempt employees receive overtime pay equal to 1.5 times his or her regular rate, if the employee works more than 40 hours per week. describing wells fargo's opening or attempted opening of the accounts as "fraud," the senators wrote in a letter to labor secretary tom perez and dol administrator david weil that "the suggestion last week by chief executive john stumpf that '[t]here was no incentive to do bad things' at wells fargo -- a company that fired 5,300 employees over five years due to improper selling but made little effort to change its policies -- does not appear to be grounded in reality." the reason for that, the senators claimed, citing media reports, is that "dozens of former and current wells fargo employees have come forward to describe the lengths they went to in order to meet the bank's aggressive sales quotas," and, "when quotas weren't met, employees faced threats of termination; mandated hours of unpaid overtime; harassment; and other forms of retaliation." dol spokesman jason surbey acknowledged that the agency had received the letter, and said: "while we cannot discuss details of potential law enforcement decision-making, we do take the concerns raised in the letter very seriously." on sept. 13, the bank said that it would end its sales goals program effective jan. 1, 2017. in response to the senators' request to the dol, wells fargo spokeswoman jennifer g. dunn told abc news today that "our team members are our greatest asset." "we strive to make every one of them feel valued, rewarded and recognized and we pride ourselves on creating a positive environment for our team members, including market competitive compensation, career-development opportunities, a broad array of benefits, and a strong offering of work-life programs," dunn added. sens. elizabeth warren, d-mass., sherrod brown, d-ohio, jack reed, d-r.i., robert menendez, d-n.j., bernie sanders, i-vt., jeff merkley, d-ore., kirsten gillibrand, d-n.y., and mazie hirono, d-hawaii, sent the letter two days after many of them grilled stumpf for nearly three hours in a senate banking committee hearing on capitol hill.      senators ask labor department to investigate wells fargo over accounts scandal

"he had a cartoonish reputation like a batman character or villain but not hatred." dowd, author of the new book, "the year of voting dangerously, the derangement of american politics," said she was disappointed by trump’s recent tweet calling her "wacky" and a "neurotic dope." "i felt like he hadn’t put much effort into giving me a good nickname. he calls all women reporters that he doesn’t like 'wacky and neurotic,'" she said. "i was hoping i would have something more distinctive like pocahontas or sleepy eyes, which he uses for chuck todd. but i just got a generic one for women.” abc news' jon karl and rick klein asked dowd whether her sister, who had been a trump supporter, would be voting for him. "i talked to trump about this. he said, 'is your sister still voting for me?' a couple months ago. and i said 'no' because you retweeted that unflattering picture of heidi cruz," dowd said. "and he said it was not that unflattering. and i said, 'yes it was. it was just a terrible thing to do. why don’t you just apologize?' and there was this long silence. and then he goes ‘ok, i apologize.’ i got the first apology out of him!" this episode of abc news' "powerhouse politics" podcast is available on itunes, stitcher, google play and tunein.      maureen dowd: donald trump’s ‘ego arithmetic hasn’t changed’      
__label__0 the clinton campaign continues their strategy of attempting to use donald trump's words against him. today, the campaign begins airing atelevision ad in seven battleground states and on cable. according to hillary clinton's team, the intention of the ad is to show the effect "trump's hateful rhetoric towards women is having on our daughters." the ad cuts between images of young girls staring into the mirror overlapped with video of trump's comments about women. "i'd look at her right in that fat ugly face of hers - she's a slob - she ate like a pig," said trump during what appears to be an interview. that comment is followed by the republican nominee, at a different time, saying "a person who is flat chested is very hard to be a 10." when the ad wraps, text appears on the screen reading "is this the kind of president we want for our daughters?" the video begins with an image of hillary clinton hugging a young girl she met in keota, iowa during the primary who told clinton she was bullied because she has asthma. hillary for america says this ad shows how trump stands in contrast to clinton's career "fighting for and uplifting women and girls," something they say she'll continue to do if elected president.      clinton campaign out with video hitting trump on comments about women

__label__1 progressive democrats are the “helicopter parents” of america. they want to protect people so much that they end up doing more harm than good, and it’s keeping segments of the american population from being fully independent. this is not what our founders envisioned when they set out to create our government.  one of the groups most negatively affected by liberal hand-holding is blacks. don’t believe me? just ask thomas sowell, who penned an amazing piece for national review on this very subject. back in the 1960s, as large numbers of black students were entering a certain ivy league university for the first time, someone asked a chemistry professor — off the record — what his response to them was. he said, “i give them all a’s and b’s. to hell with them.” since many of those students were admitted with lower academic qualifications than other students, he knew that honest grades in a tough subject like chemistry could lead to lots of failing grades, and that in turn would lead to lots of time-wasting hassles — not just from the students, but also from the administration. he was not about to waste time that he wanted to invest in his professional work in chemistry and the advancement of his own career. he also knew that his “favor” to black students in grading was going to do them more harm than good in the long run, because they wouldn’t know what they were supposed to know. such cynical calculations were seldom expressed in so many words. nor are similar cynical calculations openly expressed today in politics. but many successful political careers have been built on giving blacks “favors” that look good on the surface but do lasting damage in the long run. sowell continues his piece, lamenting the creation and maintenance of the “welfare state,” a term used to describe a government that acts as a parent of the citizen. in 1960, before this expansion of the welfare state, 22 percent of black children were raised with only one parent. by 1985, 67 percent of black children were raised with either one parent or no parent. a big “favor” the obama administration is offering blacks today is exemption from school behavior rules that have led to a rate of disciplining of black male students that is greater than the rate of disciplining of other categories of students. read the full article here and be sure to share with your liberal friends so you can watch their heads explode!       the lasting damage done by the left’s ‘favors’ to blacks      
__label__1 while ted cruz and donald trump are using the brussels attack to foment islamophobia amongst their respective bases, it’s important to note that white terrorists have killed more americans on u.s. soil than muslim terrorists since the 9/11 attacks. the new america foundation (naf), a think tank funded by prominent universities and foundations, has been keeping track of all terrorist attacks on american soil since 9/11, and found that not only have white terrorists killed more americans than jihadists, but attacks by white terrorists are also twice as frequent, with 18 homegrown terror attacks between 2004 and 2015, and just 9 terror attacks rooted in islamic extremist ideology. to define what constitutes a terrorist, naf has very specific criteria: the purpose of this database is to provide as much information as possible about american citizens and permanent residents engaged in violent extremist activity as well as individuals, regardless of their citizenship status, living within the united states who have engaged in violent extremist activity. we examine both those individuals motivated by jihadist ideology, understood as those who worked with or were inspired by al-qaeda and its affiliated groups, as well as those motivated by other ideologies that are non-jihadist in character, for example right wing, left wing, or idiosyncratic beliefs. naf’s list of terrorist attacks since september 11, 2001 includes 9 attacks led by jihadists, which have killed 45 people — the most recent attack being the san bernardino shooting in december that killed 14 and wounded 21 — and 18 attacks by american right-wing extremists that killed 48 people. most notably, while there were zero terror attacks on u.s. soil by islamic extremists between june 2, 2009 and april 14, 2013, there were eight attacks by right-wing extremists in that time frame. the most deadly of those attacks was the sikh temple shooting in wisconsin in 2012, which left six dead and four wounded. but despite the frequency and brutality of white terror attacks, there are far more muslim terrorists prosecuted and/or killed for their crimes in 11 of the 15 years studied. as the chart below shows, the only years between 2001 and 2015 where non-jihadist terrorists were indicted or killed for their crimes more than their jihadist counterparts were 2001, 2004, 2008, and 2012: data from the new america foundation additional data shows that while jihadists were diverse in ethnicity, an overwhelming majority of american terrorists were white. out of 182 total non-jihadist perpetrators of terror attacks in the us between 2001 and 2015, 165 were white. and while trump is proposing an outright ban on muslims entering the us as a way to combat terrorism, he ignores the fact that a vast majority of terrorists, both right-wing and islamic, are american-born citizens: data from the new america foundation what these numbers show is that there is no catch-all solution to stop extremist terrorism. but it’s evident that simply profiling muslims and treating all new immigrants as potential jihadists is both discriminatory and counterproductive.            guess which terrorist group has killed the most americans since 9/11

__label__1 paris — france has apparently become the first country in the world to ban plastic plates, cups and utensils, passing a law that will go into effect in 2020. exceptions will be allowed for items made of compostable, biosourced materials. the new law is a part of the country’s energy transition for green growth act, the same legislation that also outlawed plastic bags in grocery stores and markets beginning in july. although plastic bags are forbidden in other countries — including in some u.s. states — no country seems to have embraced a plastic ban as sweeping as france’s will be. the general idea behind the law — following the landmark conference held in paris last fall on curbing global warming — is to promote a “circular economy” of waste disposal, “from product design to recycling,” french lawmakers say. [a maryland county’s nickel tax for plastic bags is paying off, but not as planned] objections to plastic as a material are well known. for one, it does not biodegrade and only breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, which pose a significant danger for wildlife that cannot always distinguish it from food sources, particularly in oceans. aside from ecosystem disruptions, millions of barrels of oil are used every year in manufacturing plastic bags and utensils, playing what environmental activists call a significant role in climate change. in the words of french president françois hollande, the ban is part of a larger push intended “to make france … an exemplary nation in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, diversifying its energy model and increasing the deployment of renewable energy sources” -- starting, it would seem, with the forks and knives distributed at fast-food restaurants and the coffee cups in vending machines. not all share the enthusiasm of france’s socialist government, which has made environmental progress one of its main goals. in brussels, some argue that the laws violate existing european union legislation regarding the free movement of goods and the protection of manufacturers. eamonn bates, the secretary general of pack2go europe, a brussels-based association that represents packaging manufacturers on the continent, told the associated press that his organization will challenge france’s ban. “we are urging the european commission to do the right thing and to take legal action against france for infringing european law,” he said. “if they don’t, we will.” supporters of the ban wanted it to be introduced earlier, possibly as soon as 2017. but ségolène royal, the french environment minister, had initially considered it an “anti-social” provision, on the grounds that low-income families relied on plastic utensils and plates. the ban was then postponed until 2020.      france becomes the first country to ban plastic plates and cutlery

__label__1 get grist in your inbox sweden again it’s a response to the strange situation we’re in, where buying and shipping a new pair of shoes to your doorstep can be cheaper than repairing your old ones. on tuesday, sweden’s ruling social democrat and green party coalition will submit a series of proposals to parliament. one would cut the tax rate on repairs to shoes, clothes, and bicycles from 25 to 12 percent, the guardian reports. another would allow half of the labor cost of repairing large appliances — fridges, ovens, dishwashers — to be claimed back on incomes taxes. that’s not all: there’s also a plan for a “chemical tax” on new computers and appliances to cover the environmental cost of those new, shiny, and often unrecyclable materials. the parliament will vote on all the proposals in december. “i believe there is a shift in view in sweden at the moment,” per bolund, sweden’s minister for financial markets and consumer affairs who spearheaded the new incentives, told the guardian. “there is an increased knowledge that we need to make our things last longer in order to reduce materials’ consumption.” there sweden goes again, making the rest of us look bad. read more last week, we recommended reading literally anything that didn’t have to do with the election. this week, we’re (sort of) ready to think about why what happened … happened. in any case, it really happened. if you’re feeling depressed about that, read grist’s rebecca leber on where to go from here. cop22 though this year’s u.n. climate agenda was notably less ambitious than that of the 2015 paris meeting, climate conferences always go long. you should know that. write it down. but there are a few notable outcomes already ironed out, even if negotiators are still scrambling on the final text: thanks obama the obama administration took a big step in protecting the arctic ocean from oil and gas exploration on friday when it blocked the sale of new permits to drill in the chukchi and beaufort seas off the alaskan coast until 2022. the move was applauded by environmental groups that have long argued that drilling in the area will harm the arctic’s fragile ecosystem and contribute to catastrophic climate change. “given the unique and challenging arctic environment and industry’s declining interest in the area, forgoing lease sales in the arctic is the right path forward,” said secretary of the interior sally jewell in a statement. last year, royal dutch shell and other oil companies abandoned plans to drill in the arctic, citing the high cost of exploration as well as the falling price of oil. (public outcry may also have had something to do with it). this step by the obama administration, however, may not last. president-elect donald trump has pledged to open up new lands to drilling and could ultimately reverse obama’s decision. how crude an estimated 20 billion barrels of oil has been discovered in west texas’s permian basin. this could be, according to the usgs, the largest supply of oil ever found in the united states, worth up to $900 billion. the timing could not be better for oil prospectors — and worse for the environment. president-elect donald trump, who thinks that climate change is a hoax, has pledged to dismantle environmental regulations and rubber stamp fossil fuel projects. there is, however, one silver lining to this discovery: the low price of oil, which is currently around $45 a barrel, means much of the texas oil will likely remain underground, at least for the immediate future. “we are picking up a few rigs every now and then but we wont see it really take off until we get to that price in the $60 to $75 range,” said morris burns, former president of the permian basin petroleum association, on kwes tv. standing rock mni wiconi: the stand at standing rock takes us to the scene of the standoff over the pipeline, where gathered protesters face police violence. the phrase mni wiconi, which means “water is life” in lakota, has been used to rally support for the movement. the pipeline’s original route was rejected because it was a threat to bismarck’s water supply, but it now poses that same risk to the neighboring standing rock sioux. despite recent developments that make approval for the pipeline likely, winona laduke, founder of honor the earth, warns against despair in the short film: “don’t operate out of fear; operate out of hope. because with hope, everything is possible.” vanishing act into the ocean, it seems. new satellite data show the total area of global sea ice dipping wayyy below the national snow and ice data center’s record for this time of year. in fact, arctic sea ice has dropped well below the next-lowest seasonal extent ever observed (which was in 2012). that year’s all-time record low was narrowly avoided in september, the month when arctic sea ice levels typically are at their lowest. but the fact that ice levels are lower now than they were this same time in 2012 is part of what makes this latest data so alarming. meanwhile, antarctic sea ice is also much lower than usual at the end of the southern hemisphere’s winter. both the #antarctic and #arctic #seaice extents are abnormally small. that's the story. pic.twitter.com/nobj4wqsul — aarne granlund (@granlund_aarne) november 17, 2016  we’ve gotten somewhat used to broken records here, but watching sea ice levels flatten out when they should be peaking is well beyond normal understanding of record lows and highs. meanwhile, the temperature at the north pole right now is a not-cool 36 degrees f above average. is this what the upside down feels like? sometimes, all you need is the headline — especially when the headline is, “pittsburgh has a naughty rooster and nobody can catch him.” view more news briefs a beacon in the smog® © 1999-2016 grist magazine, inc. all rights reserved. grist is powered by wordpress.com vip. don't miss another green thing! get grist in your inbox. no thanks.      briefly sweden plans to give tax breaks for fixing stuff instead of throwing it away. we’ve got some weekend reading to help you face the post-election world. the marrakech climate talks still aren’t over, but here’s what’s gone down so far. obama halts new oil drilling in the arctic — for now. oh god, they’ve discovered even more oil in texas. watch people on the frontlines of the dakota access fight defend their water and their rights. um, where did all of the arctic and antarctic sea ice just go?

__label__1 roughly a half dozen wells fargo workers who tried doing the right thing about the bank’s scamming of customers were summarily fired. during his grilling in washington earlier this week, wells fargo ceo john stumpf testified that it was company policy to enable whistleblowers to speak out against unethical and fraudulent behavior at the bank. “each team member, no matter where you are in the organization, is encouraged to raise their hands,” stumpf said. however, bill bado, a former wells fargo banker in pennsylvania, claims he had a different experience. bado was given orders from his supervisors in september 2013 to enroll customers in phony accounts without their knowledge or consent. bado not only refused, he called the company’s ethics hotline and contacted the bank’s human resources hotline to inform them of the scam. after bado was let go, the bank’s official reason for his firing was “tardiness.” “i told them that’s not only unethical but illegal,” bado told cnn money. “they ruined my life.” a wells fargo human resources worker — who elected to remain anonymous to protect their career — also told cnn money that the corporate headquarters put policies in place that were utilized to take revenge against whistleblowers, like firing them on the spot for showing up two minutes late. former sec chairman harvey pitt said that previous financial reform legislation, like the dodd-frank act and the sarbanes-oxley act codified protections for workers calling out illegal behavior at financial institutions. “it is clearly against the law for any company (or executives of such companies) to try to suppress whistleblowing,” pitt told cnnmoney in an email. in early september, heather brock was fired from her position as a senior business banker at a wells fargo branch in round rock, texas after she spoke up about the dubious sales practices she was asked to carry out. brock said she endured textbook workplace harassment before eventually being fired. sabrina bertrand, who used to work for wells fargo in houston, described pressure from her superiors to open the scam accounts was “unbearable.” “i endured harsh bullying … defamation of character, and eventually being pinned for something i didn’t do,”brock told cnn money. “i had managers in my face yelling at me,” bertrand said. “they wanted you to open up dual checking accounts for people that couldn’t even manage their original checking account.” wells fargo was recently fined $185 million by the consumer financial protection bureau for perpetuating an elaborate scam of opening credit card and checking accounts on behalf of customers who never signed off on them in order to drive sales numbers higher. while 5,300 low-level and mid-tier employees were let go after the scam was exposed, no senior management or compliance officials have been fired as of this writing, and ceo john stumpf has not yet stepped down.              i worked at wells fargo and blew the whistle on rampant fraud — then they fired me.

__label__1 while the u.s. department of justice temporarily halted construction of a section of the dakota access pipeline, two other pipelines are moving forward. in may, the obama administration granted the permits for both the trans-pecos and comanche trail pipelines, and while construction has not yet begun on the pipelines, implementation plans for the building of the pipelines is well underway. earlier this week, desmogblog investigative reporter steve horn highlighted the approval and pending construction of both pipelines, as well as their significant impact on local water supplies and indigenous territory. as horn wrote, the trans-pecos pipeline will carry natural gas extracted from the permian basin in west texas, and transport it across international borders to mexico. according to the texas tribune, the 42-inch-wide trans-pecos pipeline will carry 1.6 billion cubic feet of gas every day under the rio grande river. should a leak or spill occur, the effects could be felt in both texas and mexico. the comanche trail pipeline, which is also 42-inches, will carry gas from the waha hub in the northern part of pecos county, texas, to san elizario, texas, where it will then be carried across the united states/mexico border. “[the] trans-pecos and comanche go through the big bend area, a rural area containing mountains, desert, and ranch land. most importantly, they link to a massive set of pipelines in mexico that are in the process of being built and it’s a bit difficult to say what the impacts of land/spills would be there,” horn told us uncut. “what sorts of environmental/ecological reviews are being done in mexico? what are the potential risks of spills there and would we even hear about them if they took place?” however, horn says the “elephant in the room” on assessing environmental impact is the fracking being done to take natural gas out of texas’ permian basin. “with temperature records being broken left and right, that’s what the conversation should really center around,” horn said. according to the latest status report filed with the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) earlier this month by pipeline builder energy transfer partners (the company also building the dakota access pipeline), construction has not yet begun. however, because the pipeline has already been granted approval by both the united states and mexican governments, horn says the only recourse left for activists is civil disobedience. “dakota access, and everything that preceded the now-ongoing civil disobedience and largest convening of native american tribes in modern history, shows the regulatory system is designed as a corporate rubber-stamp process,” horn said. “the courts are happy to ratify rulings based on laws written by and for corporate america.” horn credited the native american tribes chaining their bodies to pipeline construction equipment in north dakota with the obama administration’s recent call to temporarily halt dakota access pipeline construction near the missouri river. “[civil disobedience] might be the only option left given how much the deck is stacked in favor powerful big business interests in the us regulatory and legislative system.”                with attention on dakota, obama quietly approves two new pipelines      
__label__1 a local prosecutor in tulsa, oklahoma has brought charges against betty shelby, the officer who shot and killed terence crutcher. in a press conference thursday afternoon, the tulsa county district attorney’s office announced a warrant for officer betty shelby’s arrest on the charge of felony manslaughter in the first degree. shelby fired the shot that killed 40-year-old terence crutcher, who was unarmed and had his hands raised throughout his fatal encounter with police last weekend. breaking: #tulsa da files 1st degree manslaughter charges #bettyshelby for #terencecruther shooting. pic.twitter.com/h4pc6ebwwm — tiffany alaniz (@tiffanyalaniz) september 22, 2016  “i don’t know why things happen in this world the way they do,” said district attorney steve kunzweiler. “we need to pray for wisdom and guidance on each of our respective paths in life. each of us at the end of our days will have to account for our own actions. the only way i know to walk my path is to try every day to pray and to serve my fellow citizens so that he or she may be lifted up.” tulsa’s top law enforcement officer appealed to the community to allow the judicial system to do its work. tulsa police chief chuck jordan has contacted the united states department of justice (doj), asking them to conduct their own separate civil rights investigation into the shooting. “i want to assure our community and assure all of you, and people across the nation looking at this, we will achieve justice,” jordan said. shelby is arguing that she had a right to shoot crutcher because he allegedly failed to obey her commands. her attorney, scott wood, said shelby was a drug recognition expert and believed crutcher was under the influence of drugs when she encountered him. “by the end of the incident, officer shelby was screaming at him to stop. he did not obey one single command given to him,” wood told local media. newson6.com reported that officer shelby had two prior excessive force complaints lodged against her during the course of her career, though both were unfounded. u.s. attorney danny williams said the doj will thoroughly investigate whether or not crutcher’s civil rights were infringed upon. “will devote whatever resources necessary to ensure all allegations of serious civil rights violations are fully and completely investigated,” williams said. crutcher, a father of four, was on his way home from a community college class when his suv broke down. when officers responded, crutcher, who had his hands up, was shot when he walked toward his driver side window. officers did not find a weapon on crutcher’s person or in his vehicle.              tulsa cop betty shelby charged with manslaughter in shooting death of terence crutcher

__label__1 (editor’s note: this video contains graphic content that may be emotionally disturbing for viewers.) a video of keith lamont scott’s final moments, filmed by scott’s wife, rakeiya, has been made public. in the video, obtained by nbc news, charlotte-mecklenburg (cmpd) police officers are seen approaching the car where scott, a father of seven, was waiting for his child’s school bus to arrive. rakeiya scott is heard shouting, “don’t shoot him! he has no weapon!” while police are heard in the distance shouting at keith scott to “drop the gun.” “he doesn’t have a gun… he’s not going to do anything to you guys. he just took his medicine,” rakeiya scott said.  after four shots were fired, scott is heard repeatedly shouting, “did you shoot him?” and runs over to her husband’s car. “he better not be fucking dead, he better not be fucking dead, i know that fucking much,” scott said as officers ordered her to come to them. “we are at 9453 lexington court, and these are the police officers who just shot my husband,” rakeiya scott said. “he better live.” from the angle of the recording, it is unclear as to what led up to the killing of 43-year-old keith lamont scott. as of this writing, cmpd officers have not released the body camera video of scott’s death, despite calls from the community and even the new york times editorial board to release it. police were on the scene to search for a man with outstanding warrants, who was not scott. however, scott was nonetheless shot and killed by cmpd officers who allege he was brandishing a firearm. scott’s mother, vernita scott walker, told cbs news he was sitting in his car, waiting for his child’s school bus, and reading the koran, which he did every day. “that’s a task for him every day, so he can be out there to get a special spot,” walker said.”he sits in the truck and reads his book.”              here’s the video of charlotte police shooting keith lamont scott      
__label__1 #5. denmark pays students $900 a month to attend college. thanks to vermont senator bernie sanders’ proud identification as a democratic socialist and allusion to denmark as an ideal social democracy, denmark is being discussed throughout the news media. but what few outlets are brave enough to report is that, by almost every measurable standard, danish socialism runs circles around american capitalism. here are a few examples:  denmark has a tremendous social safety net for unemployed workers — any worker who worked at least 52 weeks over a three-year period can qualify to have 90 percent of their original salary paid for, for up to two years. the danish government also has plentiful training programs for out-of-work danes. as a result, 73 percent of danes between 15 and 64 have a paying job, compared to 67 percent of americans. world bank data on healthcare costs in developed nations. according to the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd), the us spends twice as much per capita on healthcare than in denmark, where taxpayer-funded universal healthcare is available for all citizens. 2009 oecd data shows that the u.s. spent an average of $7,290 per person on healthcare. denmark spent just $3,512. world bank data, as seen in the chart above, shows danish healthcare costs are about $3,000 less per capita than in the us.  the world happiness report, which determines which nation’s population is the “happiest” using criteria like life expectancy, gdp, social safety nets, as well as factors like “perception of corruption” and “freedom to make life choices,” found that denmark was the happiest country. the us, in the meantime, ranked #17 on the same list.  denmark leads every other oecd nation in work-life balance. danes work an average of 37 hours a week, earn an average of $46,000 usd annually, and have the right to 5 weeks of paid vacation per year. here in the us, the average worker puts in an average of 47 hours a week, and only takes 16 days of vacation a year. this is largely due to a more stressful work climate, in which wages are stagnating while costs are rising. combine that with a highly-competitive job market, and that means more americans are willing to chain themselves to their desk then to risk taking vacation days and coming back to find someone else took their job. an actual college campus in denmark. here in the us, the cost of going to college has soared by over 500 percent in the last 30 years. but in denmark, not only is college free, but students are actually paid $900 usd per month to go to school, provided they live on their own. and this funding lasts up to six years. by contrast, the average us student pays over $31,000 a year in tuition to attend a private university, out-of-state residents at public universities pay $22,000 a year in tuition, and tuition costs for in-state residents at those same universities is still over $9,000. per capita income data from the world bank. in denmark, despite a short work week and a generous social safety net, workers make more than enough to meet basic needs. according to per capita income data from the world bank, denmark’s per capita income is roughly $5,000 higher than in the us.  the benefits of living in denmark are far-reaching — out of all oecd countries, denmark has the second-lowest poverty rate at 0.6 percent. to compare, the oecd average of 11.3 percent is still lower than the 14.5  percent poverty rate in the us. so all this socialist nanny-state coddling must be making all the businesses flee denmark as fast as they can, right? wrong.  in 2014, forbes ranked denmark as the #1 best country for business. forbes used 11 different criteria to rank countries — innovation, property rights, red tape, taxes, investor protection, stock market performance, technology, corruption, personal freedom, freedom of trade, and monetary freedom. under the same criteria, the us ranked #18.  the danish government gives new parents an average of 52 weeks — a full year — of paid time off after having a child. those 52 weeks can be allocated however the parents wish. in addition to the 52 weeks, new moms get 4 weeks of maternity leave before giving birth and 14 weeks after. even new fathers get 2 additional weeks after the birth of their child. but here in the us, 1 in 4 new mothers go back to work within two weeks of having a child. this is what democratic socialism really looks like. is this the dystopian nightmare that republicans are making it out to be, or an ideal vision of what americans could have if we came together and demanded it from our government?                here are 9 reasons denmark’s socialist economy leaves the us in the dust

__label__1 just days after the university of north dakota (und) was nationally embarrassed over a student’s racist snap, the college is in hot water once again. in another snapchat post that could potentially damage the university’s reputation and recruitment efforts for african american students, a group of white female students are seen wearing blackface, with the caption “black lives matter.”  the snap was discovered just over 24 hours after a previous snap that three white female students posted after stealing an african american roommate’s phone and locking her out of her dorm room. in that post, three white female students are all smiling, and the caption on the photo reads, “locked the black bitch out!”  while the university has already opened an investigation into the first photo, university of north dakota mark kennedy said the second racist social media post in two days shows that the school has a lot of work to do to educate students on diversity, inclusion, and respect for others. in a public statement issued friday evening, kennedy said he will personally undertake an endeavor to build out a diversity education initiative for und students. i have been disappointed to learn that we have people in our university community who don’t know that the kind of behavior and messaging demonstrated in these two photos is not ok, and that, in fact, it is inexcusable. our mission is educational in nature. our student conduct process is educational in nature. this is our opportunity to provide an education to all members of our campus community, especially those who may not understand the gravity of their actions. based upon my conversations with students and others, i can assure you that the messages of the two photos are painful to many individuals. i have heard from many within our campus community, as well as alums and individuals not directly connected to the university, who are encouraging us to use this situation as an opportunity to address what some see as long standing issues within our community and across the country. we must demand better of ourselves and our university community. i am directing my team to explore best practices for diversity education amongst premier institutions and will work collaboratively with the avp for diversity and inclusion and university senate to bring it to reality at und. as of this writing, the students in the photo have not been publicly named.              white university students busted again after the second racist pic in 48 hours is exposed      
__label__1 the bloomberg network will run a live, on-screen fact check during tonight’s presidential debate, breaking precedent with other networks. politico reported monday morning that bloomberg would be verifying the factual accuracy of statements by both democratic nominee hillary clinton and republican nominee donald trump in real time on the screen. other networks have opted out of doing a live fact check, mostly because it would be too difficult. the clinton campaign has called repeatedly for a live fact check of the debate in anticipation of trump’s penchant for making unverifiable claims on live tv. “for the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give donald trump an unfair advantage,” said clinton communications director jennifer palmieri in a conference call with reporters. “we do believe it is the role of the moderator . . . to call out those lies and to do that in real time.” this would largely leave it up to moderator lester holt to call out each candidate when making a false statement. however, this could prove too controversial for holt, who would invite criticism much in the same way cnn’s candy crowley did in 2012, when she interrupted mitt romney on the topic of the banghazi attacks while moderating a debate between romney and president barack obama. however, not correcting a candidate when he or she misstates the facts can also stir up controversy. the most recentl example of that is today show anchor matt lauer choosing not to interject during one of donald trump’s responses to his questions, when the gop nominee said he never supported the iraq war (he did). and while networks have said they would fact-check each candidates’ statements in followup pieces to run the following day, it still essentially frees up both candidates to lie without being interrupted. the debate, which will take place at hofstra university in new york, airs at 9 pm eastern tonight on cnn. neither libertarian nominee gary johnson nor green party nominee jill stein have been invited to join the debate. for her part, stein will be hosting a livestream outside hofstra university where she will be answering all questions asked by a live social media audience.                  bloomberg tv to fact check debate on-screen after major networks refuse

__label__1 on the topic of climate change, hillary clinton seems more knowledgeable of donald trump’s words than he does. earlier in monday night’s presidential debate at hofstra university, democratic nominee hillary clinton pointed out that the gop nominee previously said that climate change was a hoax created by the chinese. trump immediately responded, saying, “i did not. i do not say that.” but in 2012, long before he was running for the white house, trump tweeted that exact statement. the concept of global warming was created by and for the chinese in order to make u.s. manufacturing non-competitive. — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 6, 2012  the debate over whether or not trump made that statement happened earlier in the campaign, when clinton referenced the statement in a june speech. politifact confirmed the claim as true, referencing trump’s 2012 tweet.                donald trump totally did say global warming is a chinese hoax

__label__1 three of the baltimore police officers previously charged in the death of freddie gray were recently treated like war heroes at a right-wing media gala. deneen borelli, a regular contributor to fox news, gave a speech at the media research center’s annual black tie gala lauding the officers garrett miller, edward nero, and brian rice in front of panelists like rush limbaugh, monica crowley, and cal thomas. 25-year-old freddie gray’s death — which was ruled as a homicide — was only mentioned once, as an afterthought. according to the new york daily news, borelli blamed the baltimore riots not on the six officers charged in freddie gray’s death, but on “the left, political agitators, and the national media” who were out to “advance the anti-police narrative.” “these five men and one woman, all veteran police officers, were now in handcuffs, fighting for their lives, their careers destroyed, bankrupted, humiliated,” borelli said. ““no one thanked them for their service or recognized their honor. who will thank these officers? who will thank all police officers…at a time they are being so vilified? tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we will.” officer garett miller, who remains under administrative duty pending an internal affairs investigation into gray’s death, complained that the police officer profession was “hurting,” and asked for “prayers.” “we’re losing officers at an incredible rate. not just from gunfire but because they’re tired of it. they quit. our department is short. everywhere is short. nobody wants to be a police officer anymore,” miller said. as the baltimore sun reported, gray suffered a fatal injury to his spine after taking a blow to the lower-left side of his head while being transported in a baltimore police van. officers restrained gray’s hands and ankles, and didn’t belt him in before transporting him, which is a violation of baltimore police department policy. “the assisting officer opened the doors and observed mr. gray lying belly down on the floor with his head facing the cabin compartment, and reportedly he was asking for help, saying he couldn’t breathe, couldn’t get up, and needed a medic,” the autopsy report read. all six officers charged in freddie gray’s death were ultimately cleared of all charges earlier this year.                cops who killed freddie gray honored and praised as heroes at conservative gala      
__label__1 in a powerful statement, a university of nebraska football player opened up about the racism he experienced in response to kneeling during the national anthem. before their game with northwestern this past saturday, nebraska cornhuskers players michael rose-ivey, daishon neal, and mohamed berry all took a knee during the national anthem in a silent protest of police brutality, as nfl quarterback colin kaepernick and other athletes across the country have done. in a press conference with local media on monday, rose-ivey detailed the horrific racism he experienced as a result of his protest. “i am still referred to on facebook and twitter as a ‘clueless, confused nigger’ by former high school classmates, peers, and even [nebraska] husker fans. some believe daishon, mohamed, and myself should be kicked off the team or suspended, while some say we deserve to be lynched or shot just like other black people who have died recently,” rose-ivey said. “another believe that since we didn’t want to stand for the anthem, that we should be hung before the anthem before the next game,” he added, after a long pause. however, rose-ivey said he felt obligated to take a knee, saying he was using his platform on the roster of one of the nation’s most prestigious college football programs to bring awareness to the injustice suffered by black americans on a daily basis. “while you may disagree with the method, these reactions underscore the need for these protests and gives us just a small glimpse into the problem of racism in this country and the divisive mentality of some americans,” rose-ivey said. “as dr.king said, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. the hottest place in hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of great moral conflict. an individual who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.” mohamed barry told the omaha world-herald that while the players experienced racism, the overwhelming majority of responses were positive. “our fans, they agree with it, they see the injustice, and for the most part they support us,” barry said. however, if rose-ivey’s passionate statement is any indicator, the silent protest during the national anthem won’t stop anytime soon. “there are issues in this country that need to be addressed. there are issues in this country that can no longer be pushed off onto the backs of another generation.” watch the full video of michael rose-ivey’s statement below:                   fans said i ‘should be hung before the anthem’: emotional college linebacker reveals racist threats      
__label__1 as we watch police officers hunted down and assassinated, and we see riots rear up every time a black man is shot by police, we might want to take a moment to review the actual numbers behind these shootings. the number of lives lost by police using deadly force is minuscule. since it is an act of last resort, it should be. twice as many white suspects are killed in violent encounters with police, but you never hear about that. see the statistics below. if black lives mattered so much to the radicals out there, they would focus more on reducing crime and helping their communities. they don’t… the likes of black lives matter, the new black panthers and the nation of islam riot, loot and kill, many times in their own neighborhoods. it’s the violence and chaos they want… not to rectify any injustice.  from freedom daily: 2013 u.s. population is 316,128,839 persons, here are annual percentages: ⦁ 0.012% of the u.s. population committed suicide ⦁ 0.011% of the u.s. population died in a vehicle crash ⦁ 0.004% of the u.s. population died in a criminal homicide ⦁ 0.00012% of the u.s. population died from police use of force ⦁ 0.00012% of the u.s. population was struck by lightning ⦁ 0.00009% of the u.s. population was legally killed by a private citizen in self-defense …that of the 1,491 persons that died from police use of force from 2009-2012: ⦁ 915 (61.4%) were white males ⦁ 481 (32.2%) were black males ⦁ 48 (3.2%) were males of other races ⦁ 28 (1.9%) were white females ⦁ 15 (1.1%) were black females ⦁ 4 (0.2%) were females of other races ⦁while only 6% of the u.s. population is identified as black and male, 57.9% of the persons legally killed by a private citizen in self-defense were black males. ⦁ however, 73.1% of the black males legally killed by a citizen in self-defense between 2009-2012 were killed by a black citizen. ⦁ 42.6% of victims of all solved criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were black males ⦁ 89.6% of black males killed in criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were killed by another black male ⦁ 40.6% of the police officers murdered in the line of duty from 2009-2012 were killed by black males* police officers put their lives on the line each and every day they go out there to protect us. they never know if it will be their last. they have sworn an oath that all lives matter and they will protect people from those that are criminally inclined and evil. there are very few ‘bad’ cops and they are usually weeded out. the majority of officers are those who joined to help others and keep them from harm. you have about as much chance of being struck by lightning as you do being shot by a police officer. you really have to work at it to become a statistic. those that are shot almost without fail are threatening police officers or not obeying commands. the statistics tell the story if anyone bothers to review them. violence is out of control in the black community and overwhelmingly when a person is shot, it is justified. and it happens very rarely.          if you want the truth about whose ‘lives matter’- you need to see this video      
__label__1 i just could not stomach that debate last night. in the first ten minutes, i heard nothing but horrific socialist drivel from hillary clinton. then trump immediately chimed in with protectionism and tariffs. both want socialist policies. it’s just stomach churning. trump says he’ll release his tax returns if clinton releases her deleted emails. we’ll never see either one. both candidates say they are for taking second amendment rights from those on the no-fly list which is heavily flawed and the whole concept is unconstitutional. however, the issue of isis was blood boiling. trump screwed up big time: “no wonder you have been fighting isis your entire adult life,” he told clinton. isis came into being around 2003 after the iraq war. unless she’s 13 years-old, that was just flat wrong. but even worse was hillary’s faux paux where she blustered: “take out isis in iraq and squeeze them in syria.” exactly backwards and seal team six member robert o’neill called her on it.  from independent journal review: during the debate on monday night, hillary weighed in on how we need to take down isis. she said we need to: “take out isis in iraq and squeeze them in syria.” veteran and seal team six member robert o’neill, who was part of the mission to kill bin laden, found something off about her comments. so he called her out for it:  we should wipe out isis everywhere, but especially in syria where they are headquartered. they are spreading into iraq, not the other way around. clinton also seemed to intimate that she took out bin laden. o’neill shot him with the backup of his seal team… clinton and obama merely watched and had almost nothing to do with it. lester holt was a disgrace too. not only did he not bring up benghazi or the emails, he let both candidates blather on issues where they got multiple points wrong. it was a waste of a debate. trump let hillary slide on most issues. both gave the same old talking points. one of them will be president and i guess we certainly get what we deserve in that department. we’ve richly earned it and begged for it. don’t even get me started on ted cruz fawning over trump’s lackluster performance last night. it’s disillusioning in the extreme. cruz made that bed though and now he’s lying in it. i agree with soopermexican: “there are no more heroes, there is only booze.” looks like it’s going to be a predictable, boring apocalypse.          navy seal does what others refuse to, fact checks hillary’s debate comments on isis…      
__label__1 carrie underwood got candid with her fans, and we love her for it. if anyone is the queen of modern-day country music, it’s carrie underwood. she’s got it all and more! one thing we absolutely love about carrie underwood is how candid she is with all of us. she’s never afraid to be real and tell people how life really is. she shares with us things that she’s learned from being a wife, a mom, a friend and a daughter. all the things that she wished she was told, she shares. and then some.  she sticks up for people who are being bullied, and fights for the things she believes in. all in all, carrie shows us what it looks like to be a good and graceful leader. recently underwood was in nashville performing one of her shows. during the middle of it, she paused to talk about a great woman and role model in the country music industry, dolly parton. underwood then went on to sing one parton’s hit songs, ‘i will always love you.’ after she was done with the beautiful rendition, she paused to thank a special group of people in her life. underwood explained that she couldn’t make it through certain times without strong women helping and guiding her along the way. “i have learned a lot about a whole incredible group of amazing women over the past year and a half of my life. i’ve gained just an incredible appreciation for moms — for my own mother and for the mothers of my friends and just people that i know that have had kids. i never knew what it was like to just juggle everything and try to be everything to everyone.” all of those words were said through tears streaming down the star’s face. she was genuine and heartfelt about everything she was saying. you can tell that she’s been impacted tremendously by this group of ladies.  after she said all of that, she encouraged all of her fans. she let everyone know that she appreciates them and their support so much. then she laughed as she let the crowd know that she may not make it through her next song, which was “what i never knew i always wanted.” carrie never fails to make every moment real and heartfelt. it’s something that we as fans absolutely adore about her. she has never let her fame and success get in the way of showing love, kindness and gratefulness to everyone. watch the amazing moment below!  we love you, carrie!!       carrie underwood uncontrollably cries on stage, this left me in tears      
__label__1 nascar officials have been working hard for a couple weeks now on how they really ant post race inspections to look. we’ve seen nascar’s executive vice president, steve o’donnell, speak out several times over the matter of post race inspections and how he’d like them to go. basically, he wants the attention off of that aspect of things so estate everyone can focus on good racing. so in order for that to happen, o’donnell and the rest of the executives have changed the format a bit, as we all know by now! they cut out the lower two tears of the penalty system and are only focusing on issuing penalties for failing post race laser inspection if the car fails it to a large degree.  however, executives realize that this may give drivers some leeway for cheating tactics. and steve o’donnell is trying to nip that in the bud. in a meeting this past weekend at new hampshire, he made himself very clear as to what their expectations from the drivers were. “i want to make clear to everybody here that in nascar’s judgment, any measures that are taken to circumvent what happens for postrace inspection, we are going to react. we know that’s subjective. but ask all of you not to put it in our hands because we will react if we have to. i think everybody knows what that means. we want to concentrate on the race. … we couldn’t be more clear. i hope everybody agrees with that.” it’s awesome to see the officials making themselves clear and being open about their expectations!  we’ll see how open they are in the future however, seeing that o’donnell didn’t clarify what cheating was in their books. there are allegations that “no cheating” might even include stopping the drivers from weaving back and forth on the cool down lap. only time will tell!       nascar just called teams out for cheating, you won’t believe this      
__label__1 between the protests in charlotte and athletes across the country refusing to stand for the national anthem, the black lives matter movement is getting a lot of attention. but not everyone is on board. cleveland cavaliers star lebron james was giving a press conference, where he was asked for his opinion on athletes refusing to stand for the national anthem in support of black lives matter. and his response made liberals furious.   james began his statement by saying that while he respected colin kaepernick, he didn’t agree with the protest. “me, standing for the national anthem is something i will do. that’s who i am,” he explained. “that’s what i believe in. but that doesn’t mean i don’t respect and don’t agree with what colin kaepernick is doing.” it was an exceedingly fair statement, but james wasn’t done yet. he continued, saying, “i’m not up here saying that all the police are bad, because they’re not. i’m not up here saying all kids are great and all adults are great, because they’re not. but at the same time, all lives do matter. it’s not just about black or white, it’s everyone.”   well, james did himself in there, because “all lives matter”? that phrase is unforgivable to liberals. and they quickly began not only attacking james for his statement, they even accused james — a black man — of racism. no, really:  lebron james better sit for the anthem or he a uncle tom — black skip baeless (@rusjacksbrook) september 26, 2016  "all lives matter" is a dog whistle, a thing racists say that doesn't sound racist at 1st glance but clearly communicates a racist idea. — jerry topsider (@bostonjerry) september 26, 2016  you can't expect some of these so-call athletes to take a stand with their own people. money is the power to keep them neutral #lebronjames — aaron spiveysorrells (@aaronss101) september 26, 2016   but not everyone was quick to slam him. some people wisely remembered that james is much more of a friend to the minority community than black lives matter activists are:  lebron james just donated $41.8m to the university of akron in ohio, giving 1,100 kids a full 4-yr scholarship but y'all calling him a coon. — nuff$aid (@nuffsaidny) september 26, 2016   the black lives matter movement doesn’t do much to improve things for inner-city kids or the minority community. lebron james does. but hey, keep smearing him as a racist uncle tom because he said something you don’t agree with. great idea.       video: lebron james says ‘all lives matter’ and the left goes savage!

__label__1 liberals are not known for their rationality and logic. the entire liberal movement revolves around emotion and assuaging their poor, hurt feelings while telling people whatever they want to hear. on top of that, they’re hyper-sensitive, shrieking in outrage and demanding safe spaces whenever they’re confronted with anything that doesn’t fit into their narrow liberal worldview. one liberal learned the hard way that the rest of the world doesn’t always play along.   some crazy liberal girl was driving along to pick up her son from school when she was confronted with the worst thing she could possibly come across: a homeowner with trump signs on his lawn. she said that she drives past his house occasionally and it makes her absolutely enraged, having to see a private citizen expressing his own first amendment rights. so when she saw him in his driveway, she flipped him off and then called the police when he started following her. unfortunately, things didn’t quite go as planned.   the “mother f***er”, as she described him, got in his car and photographed her car and license plate. so. she reacted exactly as expected, with maturity and wisdom. ha! not exactly. instead, she yelled, “back off, you f***ing racist!” and began honking her horn and flashing her lights at him. this drew the attention of a police officer, who informed her that she was now a public disturbance, as she was carrying on like a lunatic in a school zone. she explained to the officer that she was recording him, for all of her social media “followers” and told the officer that she flipped off the man for having trump signs displayed. “my question is, why would you even go out of your way to do that?” the officer, very reasonably, asked. her answer? because she’s angry about the election, which evidently gives her the right to do whatever the heck she wants. the officer, however, told her that she was letting her emotions get the best of her and to just move on. and then she really lost it. “move on? there is a racist, xenophobic maniac running for president and that guy is supporting him and if i give him the finger, that’s a peaceful… ” she ranted. “my point is that i silently protested something i don’t agree with.” so she can give someone the finger because she has first amendment rights, but this man — who she disagrees with — evidently should not be allowed to express his own opinions and beliefs, all because she doesn’t like them. and miss crazy pants learned the hard way that she can’t do whatever she wants without consequences. “what you need to do is stay away from him,” he said. “don’t drive by his residence.” she responded that she has to drive by his house, so the officer warned her that he has cameras outside recording her actions. “i would recommend that you just drive on next time,” he said. “don’t start fights.” ouch.       crazy liberal flips off ‘big redneck’ trump supporter – then calls the cops to save herself (video)      
__label__1 snopes.com has long been regarded as the gold standard for fact-checking internet myths, hoaxes and viral stories. when you see your friends share something that seems kind of crazy, you can visit snopes and get the truth. or can you? there have been allegations of liberal bias at snopes. they only added political fact-checking to their site relatively recently and it is not often honest. instead, it tends to be about putting liberal spin on issues that democrats need to have covered. and now we know why: their lead fact-checker is a failed liberal blogger.   lacapria originally tried to begin her blogging career at the inquisitr, a site ironically known for its hoaxes, fake quotes and satire. she was not successful there, perhaps due to her open liberal bias. she referred to members of the tea party as “teahadists,” for example. so of course, that bias bleeds over into her “fact checking.” take facebook, for example. it’s known now that facebook employees were made to hide conservative stories that were trending. lacapria, however, discounted this as just “rumors.” when hillary made her, “we didn’t lose a single person in beghazi” gaffe, lacapria dismissed that as well, suggesting that hillary was referring to a 2011 invasion, rather than the 2012 attack.   it goes on and on with lacapria and at snopes in general. while they may do a good job at debunking ufo rumors and internet hoaxes, they perhaps should leave politics alone, as they clearly can’t leave their bias at the door.       bad news – guess who snopes’ fact checker really is — you won’t believe it      
__label__1 there has been a lot of speculation surrounding the shooting death of keith scott at the hands of charlotte police. the police department says the shooting was justified, as scott had a gun and threatened officers. scott’s defenders say that he was merely waiting to pick up his children from their bus stop and was holding a book, not a gun. what is the truth? it’s still unclear, but a new revelation from scott’s wife may shed some more light on what really happened.   the media has begun to dig into scott’s background and found that rakeyia scott took out a restraining order against him, claiming that he was abusive. she also said that he had a gun and threatened to kill her. in it, she wrote, “he hit my 8 year-old in the head a total of three times with is [sic] fist… .he kicked me and threaten [sic] to kill us last night with his gun. he said he is a ‘killer’ and we should know that.”   the form also asked if there was any reason law enforcement officers should view him as a potential threat and if he carries a weapon. she answered “yes” and wrote, “he carries a 9mm black.” the order was filed october 9th, 2015 and less than two weeks later, scott voluntarily cancelled it herself. but it certainly lends credence to the department’s claim that scott was armed and dangerous. police also released the dashcam and bodycam footage from the shooting, as well as photos of the handgun scott had on him at the time. the gun was allegedly the same weapon that another homeowner reported as stolen after someone broke into their house.   and police dispute the notion that scott was merely waiting for his children’s bus to arrive, peacefully reading a book and doing nothing wrong. they first observed him rolling a blunt, which was not a priority for them at first. but when they saw him hold up a gun, they took more notice and decided to arrest him, because the combination of drugs and guns is a threat to public safety. the officers, who were originally in plain clothes, outfitted themselves with marked duty vests and equipment so it would be clear they were police officers, and gave scott multiple commands to drop the gun. he refused. scott’s dna and fingerprints were found on the gun, which was loaded. so again, we have another case of the black lives matter movement exploiting a justified police shooting and using it to spawn riots and violence in the name of “justice.”       wife of keith scott: “he kicked me and threatened to kill us last night with his gun” [video]      
__label__1 hillary clinton, former, secretary of state, has stuck to her story that she handed over all of her work-related emails. even though, she wiped her computer with the equivalent of electronic bleach, not a simple cloth, yeah…she has absolutely nothing to hide! the best part, hillary holds fast to her claim, even as new batches of emails are recovered. emails, that were not included in her alleged “complete” batch, she’d originally turned over. now, 30 emails that had been previously wiped off the face of the earth, were recovered. unfortunately for hillary, they were related to benghazi, but she knew that didn’t she?  fbi investigators recovered 30 emails from hillary clintonâs wiped server which discussed benghazi, government lawyers said in federal court on tuesday. the disclosure was made during a hearing before u.s. district court judge amit mehta in a case involving a lawsuit filed by the watchdog group judicial watch. government lawyers told u.s. district court judge amit p. mehta tuesday that an undetermined number of the emails among the 30 were not included in the 55,000 pages previously provided by clinton to state. the agency said it would need until the end of september to review the emails and redact potentially classified information before they are released. government lawyers revealed in a court filing last week that some of the emails recovered by fbi investigators from her email server contained âsearch termsâ related to benghazi. clinton gave the state department more than 30,000 of her work-related emails in dec. 2014. of those, the state department released 296 emails related to benghazi and libya. the agency asserted that those were all of the clinton emails it had pertaining to benghazi. but in september, the state department discovered another 925 benghazi-related emails. those were handed over to the house select committee on benghazi. but it was revealed last month that clinton deleted âseveral thousandâ work-related emails from her server. do they really need a full day to prepare per email that was recovered? must be some pretty good stuff in there… hmmm      breaking: they did it- deleted benghazi emails recovered!      
__label__1 holy cow, i started crying when i read this post. mark ross had just found out that his sister had been killed in a car accident by some dumb punk. his number 1 priority was to get to his mom to comfort her a couple states away. he had a friend drive him even though his friend had a suspended license. in ohio, they were pulled over for a traffic violation and ross was thinking, “we’re going to jail,” because his friend was driving illegally and he had a warrant out for his arrest.   the state trooper had the car towed so they were stranded. ross, breaking into tears explained to the other police officer who showed up, sgt. david robison, that his sister was just killed and he was trying to get to his mom to comfort her. instead of arresting him, sgt. robison offered to drive him 100 miles (as far as he could go) to drop him closer to family. just as robison was dropping him off, he asked if he could pray for him. ross’ facebook post explains the moment, “he reaches over and began praying over me and my family.” ross then goes on to explain to his friends that, “everybody knows how much i dislike cops, but i am truly grateful for this guy. he gave me hope.” the one thing you can get from this story is that all lives matter and true humanity doesn’t see color. this cop helped a young man who was in pain because that is humanity and that is what police officers do. they are not trained to do it, it is in their blood. most people join the police force because they want to help people. i am grateful for this christian man who helped a young man gain hope and comfort. this nation doesn’t need a movement of black lives matter or any lives matter… this nation needs more christian people doing their duty as christians to succor the weak or weary. our national campaign shouldn’t be #blm but #wwjd. we all need to remember when we go to work, the grocery store or drive down the street… what would jesus do, what would he do for you? what has jesus done for your family? how can you reciprocate jesus’ love and be more like him who suffered every inhumanity there was and then rose above it all? thanks mark ross for giving me my perspective back. i’m grateful you posted this. god bless your family in this time of need. here’s his selfie with the sgt. this is what he wrote about it: at 3am i got a phone call stating that my sister had been killed in a car accident due to some young dumb punk! i haven’t slept and instantly got on the road. of course we were speeding, trying to get back to detroit. and we got pulled over in ohio. i knew i was going to jail due to a petty warrant. the police called wayne county and they refused to come get me because of the distance. i explained to the officer that my sister had died and that i needed to get to my mother asap. i broke down crying and he saw the sincerity in my cry. he reaches over and began praying over me and my family. he offered to bring me 100 miles further to detroit because they towed the vehicle. everybody knows how much i dislike cops but i am truly greatful for this guy. he gave me hope         this black man hates cops, then his sister was killed and something changed…      
__label__1 tony stewart is still fighting to remain in the chase, and so far it doesn’t look very promising. tony stewart has had an interesting season to say the least. what started out not very promising thanks to a back injury has now turned into him being in the running towards a championship. over the years smoke has been involved in many controversial things. from being accused and admitting to wrecking people intentionally to being involved with a man being hit on the track, resulting in the end of his life. overall, tony has seen some pretty harsh things. and that can take a toll on a guy. however, he still manages to give back to people in the most amazing ways!  in a recent event, it looks like smoke’s giving saved a life. according to a racing team first responder, jay masur, tony stewart’s lending of equipment saved his life. masur has been a first responder for years. he’s seen first hand just how dangerous racing is. he’s also been in instances where tony stewart is the one he’s responding to. now it looks like the roles have reversed. masur was responding to an incident on a dirt track when he lost control of his four wheeler, causing him to fly off into the air and on the ground.  now you may be wondering where tony stewart fits into all of this. a few years before this incident, masur responded to one of smoke’s wrecks and reportedly saved his life. that’s how tony felt at least. so after everything was said and done, smoke bought masur and his team top of the line equipment. that equipment, including a helmet, is what masur claims saved his life. “i believe i swerved to miss something and flew off the four wheeler and ended up hitting my head pretty hard. i believe this helmet probably saved my life, there’s no doubt. we all feel like, we’re bullet proof, we all feel, in the jobs we do, it can’t happen to us, because we’re pretty good at our stuff, but no matter how much we prepare, how much we plan, things happen, and at the end of the day, love your family, treat every day like it’s the last day on earth, because it may be. we saved [tony’s] life and i truly believe he had a huge part in saving mine.” wow! that’s amazing. tony has yet to speak out about this incident, but we can only imagine how he feels. our thoughts and prayers go out to jay masur and his family as he continues to heal from this incident!         tony stewart hit with life threatening situation, i can’t believe this is happening      
__label__1 the first presidential debate between democrat nominee hillary clinton and republican rival donald trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments. nbc’s lester holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted trump to “fact-check” him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong. in one of the more contentious exchanges, holt insisted that trump had supported the iraq war from the beginning, but trump continuously denied it, usa politics today reported. rather than ask clinton why she voted for the war, holt continued to press trump, saying that in an interview with fox news’ neil cavuto, trump expressed his support for the war. after the debate was over, cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that trump wasn’t all gung-ho about invading iraq before we went in — he had his reservations. “you know, what happened to the days of douglas macarthur? i mean he would go in and attack. he wouldn’t talk. i mean we have to, you know, it’s sort of like either do it or don’t do it,” trump said. “well, he’s (bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. because perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. perhaps we should be waiting for the united nations. you know, he’s under a lot of pressure,” said trump, clearly unsure if invading iraq was the right choice. you can see it here:  instead of hammering trump for his alleged “support” for the iraq war, the moderator really should have asked clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than trump did. it shouldn’t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear trump’s name. luckily, trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both clinton and her media pals at the same time. share this on facebook and twitter and let us know what you thought of the debate on monday night. do you think that the debate was rigged? scroll down to comment below!      breaking: cavuto just exposed lester holt’s lies during debate      
__label__1 to say that the relationship between republican presidential nominee donald trump and house speaker paul ryan is a bit tepid would be nothing short of an understatement. nevertheless, for all of their differences that have been repeatedly highlighted by the liberal media, ryan has endorsed trump over democrat rival hillary clinton, and that didn’t change following monday night’s presidential debate. according to politico, ryan broke from some other seemingly disappointed republicans on capitol hill to offer high praise for trump’s debate performance. “i saw donald trump give a spirited voice to those of us who don’t like the status quo, and i see emerging in front of us the potential for what a unified republican government can get you, which can be the solutions,” ryan stated tuesday morning at a press conference. “i think he passed a number of thresholds … and showed that for 90 minutes he could go toe-to-toe with hillary clinton,” he added. other gop members thought trump could have done better, though, and several lamented the many “missed opportunities” where trump could have landed damaging blows against clinton over a host of problem issues for her — except that he didn’t even take a swing. nevertheless, trump was not hung out to dry by his fellow republicans after the debate, and the high praise from ryan showed that at least some in the gop establishment have apparently come to terms with trump as potentially the next president. in other words, don’t believe all the stories about disunity from a left-leaning media that fears victory by a consolidated republican party. please share this on facebook and twitter so that everyone can see what speaker of the house paul ryan had to say about donald trump following the first presidential debate. what do you think of what speaker paul ryan had to say about donald trump after the presidential debate? scroll down to comment below!      breaking: paul ryan stuns voters with bombshell announcement after debate      
__label__1 there’s a lot to be discussed about last night’s debate between hillary clinton and donald trump. one thing that has baffled many is how hillary seemed so ready with answers and detailed facts and, almost as bizarrely, she didn’t cough or reach for water once. well, this twitter user might have an answer. do you see it? i think we all know why #trumpwon pic.twitter.com/nwzrxvkx81 — usa for trump 2016 (@usafortrump2016) september 27, 2016  this wouldn’t be the first time hillary had to use a device for help. what do you think? is just a trick of light and shadows? a zipper? or was hillary actually hiding a “cough prevention machine” in her pantsuit? will you support donald trump, hillary clinton or another candidate? share your thoughts! and like this page for the latest trump news. interested in stopping hillary? like this page        site navigation people are claiming hillary wore a earpiece/anti-coughing device last night      
__label__1 okay, i have to admit that last night i only watched the debate to see hillary have a seizure, collapse at the podium or go into a weird coughing fit like she does. none of those things happened. as a matter of fact everything about her look was flawless… makeup, wrinkles (where did they go my mom asked), new highlights, perfectly coiffed hair. i wondered how after months of strange episodes of coughing fits, falling, unable to walk up stairs without help, shuddering that looks like mini-seizures; how she was able to stand up for the entire debate without assistance. the first half of the debate, her eyelids looked heavy, but that went away about halfway through when whatever they gave her kicked in. my friend nancee jones said that she “was disappointed in trump tonight but? he was going up against a politician (which he is not) and a congenital liar. i don’t know if she specifically lied tonight (maybe about him supporting the iraq war??) but she is also a sociopath. there are two more debates and i do pray he comes in better prepared and can get some zingers in there on those.” i agree, i was excited to watch trump the first half, but then whatever hillary took (conjecture) kicked in, she was like a general on a warpath. she didn’t care that her red suit already made her look aggressive, she allowed the claws to come out. she did an excellent job baiting trump and the poor untrained debater, trump, took that bait every time. despite everyone agreeing that hillary got the better of trump, even the liberal panel from pbs news hour looked downtrodden, even dejected over her performance. yes, hillary won, but they complained that hillary didn’t put out anything substantive. they didn’t feel the ‘leg tingle’ so to speak about her performance. they didn’t even look very enthusiastic that she had just wiped the floor with trump’s expensive blond hair (that is not a hairpiece, i’ve seen it in person). even liberal cnn’s david gergen said that hillary didn’t do enough. headline for his recent post states that: ‘clinton crushed trump, but was that enough?’ coming into the presidential debate, i thought that if hillary clinton won decisively, she would virtually lock up the election. coming out, it was clear that she did win decisively, but i suspect that the campaign will remain ferociously close. for one thing, trump supporters aren’t judging him by traditional standards. they have heard establishment politicians over-promise and under-deliver for so long that they crave something different. they were quick last night to see yet more signs of media bias. trump was an angry figure, yes, but he is also giving voice to their anger. equally to the point, mrs. clinton seemingly struggled in the debate to create closer emotional bonds with voters. she has been vexed with the issue of likability throughout this campaign and in recent months her team has become concerned about her ability to mobilize millennials in the way that barack obama did so successfully. while hillary ‘won’ because her ‘arguing was good’, she lost because even her own people don’t feel a ‘connection’ to her. of course they wouldn’t, she’s a monster. someone else was happy that hillary turned up such a turd at the debate and he doesn’t get to vote for either candidate. my favorite fact about the debacle last night called a debate is that there are whole stories on what ‘putin’ thought of the debate… because we really care. in reality, we don’t, we’re still ‘merica but it’s funny to see how interested the world still is in the united states. russia’s state-run media practically announced that: trump won putin’s focus group and judging from russia’s state-sponsored twitter coverage of the presidential debate, the kremlin is anything but a swing state.   presidential candidates first debate 2016 scandals  gennifer flowers: the first scandal of the debate erupted over the weekend as the candidates traded tweets over who they would invite to watch the debate live in new york. hillary first announced plans to invite mark cuban, who has been critical of trump, to which trump responded with a threat to invite former bill clinton mistress gennifer flowers. trump’s quips are amazingly similar to the way i would respond to other’s nastiness. i really loved his twitter response:  if dopey mark cuban of failed benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps i will put gennifer flowers right alongside of him! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) september 24, 2016    hi donald. you know i'm in your corner and will definitely be at the debate!… — gennifer flowers (@gennflowers) september 24, 2016   podium-gate: the next point of contention proves that “size does matter”, at least to hillary clinton. last week, hillary’s team demanded a step stool for their candidate so that the 5’4″ hillary wouldn’t look small and frail beside the larger 6’2″ trump. while the debate commission denied the step stool they did allow a “custom-made” podium which was presumably scaled down by exactly 14% to match hillary’s relative stature…this is the status of american politics folks. here’s a look at the podiums to be used last night:   ear mics: the next scandal arose out of the last commander in chief forum hosted by matt lauer in which hillary was accused of wearing an ear piece so as to receive guidance from advisers during the discussion. according to the world tribune, the issue prompted one maryland voter to write a letter to the federal elections commissioner, matthew petersen, seeking assurances that ear pieces would not be allowed though no such assurances were provided. that said, carlos greer, of the commission on presidential debates, sent out a message to news organizations on sept. 9 banning devices that would allow presidential debate moderators get directions from their news teams.         all you need to know about the debate in one article – scandals and all…      
__label__1 black lives matter released their platform last month that calls for defunding police departments, race-based reparations, voting rights for illegal immigrants, fossil-fuel divestment, an end to private education and charter schools, a “universal basic income” and free college for blacks. based on this platform it is obvious that ‘black people’ don’t have parents or families to teach them how to take care of themselves and their own needs.   based on that ‘platform’ it comes as no surprise that black lives matter got upset when an unofficial blm chapter held a protest that turned into a cookout with the local police. the blm made sure to denounce the chapter and event immediately:  this is not an official #blacklivesmatter chapter! this is not in line with our principles. @blklivesmatter https://t.co/iilntbge1s — blacklivesmatter dc (@dmvblacklives) july 20, 2016   trying to heal the wounds of a nation and come together by working together is not the goal of black lives matter. in their tweet and many conversations about the event thereafter, they have revealed that their goal is destruction. they want to rip apart america by creating a divide between races which is essentially the goal of their major donor, george soros. soros is known for disrupting the economies of nations to profit from the unrest. this is why the major black lives donor has given at least $33 million in grants to black lives matter through his open society foundation and from the center for american progress. soros funded political movement, occupy wallstreet, didn’t have the bones and anger to rip apart america because it was a bunch of people who don’t want to work. but the black community is a huge part of the thread of what is america. soros’ attempt to create a massive racial divide between ‘white and black’ on the backs of familial deaths in the black community and blaming it on society instead of the individual looks like a winning movement. to disallow communities to try and heal that divide is contrary to soros’ plan. what happened in the wichita, kansas community was an attempt to close that divide. ksnw, the nbc affiliate station covering the area, said that the event, which was hosted by the sunflower community action group, wasn’t just a lighthearted celebration — it was a way for the community to reach out to its police department to discuss issues surrounding police-community relations. the wichita eagle reported that “at one table, three men – a black man, a hispanic man and a white man – sat down with burgers next to lt. travis rakestraw to share their ideas.” black lives matter later responded to their initial tweet that the event was against blm principles saying, “our statement about blm bbq’s with police was a direct response to the tons of people and orgs who were upset by the event. we assured folks our principles were still focused on dismantling the system.” dividing people by race, gender, age and religion is the key to dismantling the system. the ‘cops’ are the enforcers of ‘the system’ which is called rule of law. without rule of law you will have dismantled the melting pot that is america. who will survive the anarchy that black lives matter are working for? who is most likely to lose out? inner-cities are most likely to lose out if anarchy replaces rule of law.  to end police brutality you have to end the police. — brotha b (@blakedontcrack) july 22, 2016         blacklivesmatter boss comes clean – now we know, their leaders seek no solutions…      
__label__1 perhaps i’m in the minority here, but i didn’t see a “clear winner” from the debate. hillary clinton was scripted and robotic as ever. donald trump was a more restrained version of himself. i feel like there were so many missed opportunities on his part. he should’ve brought up the clinton foundation. he should’ve slammed hillary after she accused him of being a sexist. he should’ve hammered her on benghazi. still, there were no major gaffes, so that’s a relief. and honestly, i think donald trump will perform even better in the next debate. he has a good feel for it now and will probably make sure he doesn’t let opportunities slip away. still, some say there was a clear winner. here are the results from a series of online polls. drudge report:  time:  breitbart:  the hill:  here’s where it gets really interesting: cnbc:  abc:  obviously, online polls aren’t scientific (sample sizes vary and aren’t always reflective of the population and so on), but still. she’s behind gary johnson and jill stein in abc’s online poll. if that’s not embarrassing, i don’t know what is.      hillary clinton falls behind third party candidates in abc’s online survey      
__label__1 scott adams, the creator of the dilbert cartoon, wrote a blog post about switching his endorsement from hillary clinton to donald trump, and it’s a great read. adams was ready to help make herstory until hillary proposed her most recent tax plan, which includes raising estate taxes, which adams views (correctly) as “robbery by government.” in case you hadn’t heard, hillary wants to force people with a net worth of over $500 million to give the government sixty-five percent of their riches.  well over half, you guys.   and worse, as adams points out, the actual plan would result in increased taxes on lower value estates too.  and these estate taxes would be on top of the income taxes that have already been paid.   adams paints the picture: in my case, a dollar i earn today will be taxed at about 50% by various government entities, collectively. with clinton’s plan, my remaining 50 cents will be taxed again at 50% when i die. so the government would take 75% of my earnings from now on. there’s a good reason adams opposes the estate tax, and there’s a good reason you should too: i oppose the estate tax because i was born to modest means and worked 7-days a week for most of my life to be in my current position. (i’m working today, sunday, as per usual.) and i don’t want to give 75% of my earnings to the government. (would you?) how does anyone defend such a proposition?  it’s theft, plain and simple. as you might expect from a hilarious cartoonist, adams also gives snarky reasons he’s switching his vote.  like this one: it seems to me that trump supporters are planning for the world’s biggest party on election night whereas clinton supporters seem to be preparing for a funeral. i want to be invited to the event that doesn’t involve crying and moving to canada. adams explains trump’s strategy in a way that even trump’s top strategists should be taking note of, because it’s perfect: trump always takes the extreme position on matters of safety and security for the country, even if those positions are unconstitutional, impractical, evil, or something that the military would refuse to do. normal people see this as a dangerous situation. trained persuaders like me see this as something called pacing and leading. trump “paces” the public – meaning he matches them in their emotional state, and then some. he does that with his extreme responses on immigration, fighting isis, stop-and-frisk, etc. once trump has established himself as the biggest bad-ass on the topic, he is free to “lead,” which we see him do by softening his deportation stand, limiting his stop-and-frisk comment to chicago, reversing his first answer on penalties for abortion, and so on. if you are not trained in persuasion, trump look scary. if you understand pacing and leading, you might see him as the safest candidate who has ever gotten this close to the presidency. that’s how i see him. adams attributes trump’s suitability for the role of president to his persuasive personality: most of the job of president is persuasion. presidents don’t need to understand policy minutia. they need to listen to experts and then help sell the best expert solutions to the public. trump sells better than anyone you have ever seen, even if you haven’t personally bought into him yet. you can’t deny his persuasion talents that have gotten him this far. no.  you really can’t deny his persuasion talents. 41 more days, y’all.  41 more days.      dilbert creator switches presidential endorsement      
__label__1 there’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now. there is one thing that has baffled many…. hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! she was so ready with answers and detailed facts. almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. this is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking! the latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? or just something fashionable for old ladies? twitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?  it certainly wouldn’t be the first time hillary had to use a device for help. what do you think? could it be a trick of light and shadows? a puffy zipper, perhaps? or was hillary actually hiding a “cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?  hillary clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece. fox news reported that “clinton spokesman nick merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the tv lights or a flash.” while we aren’t sure what was going on inside hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by woods from clinton and huma abedin that the wikileaks archive released, “did u take your earpiece or do i need to get it?”  woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“she can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”  then woods added: “she literally can’t help herself. she’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.” of course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. hmmm no one has talked about hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches. some claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights. we’ll let you be the judge.       people noticed something odd about hillary’s outfit at the debate last night      
__label__1 a mcdonough, georgia wal-mart employee refused to make a thin blue line cake for an officer’s retirement party and it sparked an online firestorm. the cake design was relatively simple, a black and white american flag with a blue stripe in it. i’m no pastry chef, but that seems fairly easy to me. below is an example:  but it wasn’t the ease of the cake design that kept the bakers from fulfilling the order, it was the fact that “some could perceive it as racist.” the customer, the officer’s daughter, then thought she could receive a more favorable answer by asking for just a thin blue line on a chocolate background, but the baker said she wasn’t comfortable doing that either. confused by the resistance to make such a cake, the daughter asked the baker, “is there something wrong with cops?” a family friend, who is also an officer, posted about the incident on facebook:  the manager of the wal-mart reached out to the woman to offer her a gift cart, party supplies as well as a cake, but the damage was done. the daughter had also gone to kroger to have the cake made. the cake that the family received was poorly made and looked completely unprofessional, according to the daughter. a picture of the cake is below:  in an exclusive interview with todd starnes, the daughter said that if she refused a customer’s request, she would have been fired. “i work in retail,” the officer’s daughter told starnes. “if i didn’t want to deal with a customer — and said ‘no’ — i would get fired.” so, let’s set something straight, conservatives have already made it very clear that nobody should be forced to make a cake that they object to and it’s true, they shouldn’t. the family here did what everyone should do and they moved on to another bakery that made the cake without objection. what also happened here is what should also happen, the public put pressure on the company to either stand up for what they did, or to cave and make the cake. the free market should take care of the public’s opinion on a business. if you refuse business for any reason and you’re in a non-emergency profession, you should be able to do so. and that person who you refused should be able to go out and express their opinion about your refusal, and the public should decide whether or not to continue to visit your business and spend their money there. if this wal-mart was in my area, i would refuse to shop there because i fundamentally disagree with the kind of people they hire. just keep in mind that despite how much anger this story creates inside you, you should not fall into the trap of demanding someone comply with your desires.       disgraceful: wal-mart employee refuses to decorate pro-cop cake because ‘that’s racist’      
__label__1 after colin kaepernick knelt during the national anthem before a football game, he became a nationally recognized name. some people decided to burn his jersey for disrespecting our nation and some held him up as a hero of the first amendment. and there is the owner of krossroads rock and country bar in virginia beach, virginia who saw the act as disrespectful and decided to make a statement of his own. he used a kaepernick jersey as a doormat and posted a sign on the door reminding patrons to “wipe their feet.”  one patron, james perry, not only viewed this as inappropriate but also, wait for it, racist. the facebook post he made is below, but he does use some foul language, so watch out for that.   the business owner said what the rest of us already know, that this was about him disrespecting our flag, not race. just because he’s half-black doesn’t make this racist. these people are using words they don’t even understand to try to shut down free speech because they don’t like it. perry cries about how kaepernick was just using his first amendment right to express his opinion, but the reality is that this bar is just doing the same thing. one of his friends mentioned that they had plans to steal the jersey from the front of the bar and another insinuated that they would give it up because they’re afraid of riots. (because that’s a good reason to riot, you buncha’ buffoons.)  unfortunately for these morons, that would be considered theft of private property and they could end up in prison. but something tells me that wouldn’t bother them.       a bar in virginia used colin kaepernick’s jersey as a doormat & liberals are upset      
__label__1 the fbi investigation of the hillary clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like fbi director james comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. comey gave immunity to all of hillary’s top aides, including chief of staff cheryl mills, even though mills had refused to cooperate with the fbi throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. now, the house judiciary committee has scheduled a hearing for september 28th that will decide comey’s fate.   former u.s. attorney joseph digenova has loudly called for comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “this now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” digenova said. he believes that the fbi should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for mills’ computer. “the contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the fbi because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “this was not a real investigation. this was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.” digenova demanded that congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. this week, comey will have to answer for his behavior.   will congress hold comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? he isn’t just having to face a hearing; he’s been issued a subpoena from congress, too. congress has repeatedly requested that comey provide certain documents on clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. in a further attempt to get comey to comply, lamar smith of texas has slapped comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents. how loyal is comey to hillary, really? is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her? and if the answer to that question is “yes,” then the new question becomes… why?       breaking: steps to force fbi director comey to resign in process – hearing decides his fate sept 28      
__label__1 it would not surprise me in the least if the moderators in tonight’s debate help hillary clinton. in fact, i would bet on it. however… trump is no wallflower or wilting lily. if the moderators are unfair to him, he’s going to come out and challenge them. there won’t be political niceties here. he’s a scrapper. i may not support the man, but trust me, i think he will mop the stage with these limp marxists. that’s his brand. hillary may think she has it in the bag and that the moderators will protect her and correct trump at every turn, but not so fast. trump has an unsettling effect on people. he’s known for throwing them off balance. and he loves the limelight… you don’t think for a moment that he will let someone like clinton upstage him, do you? don’t be silly.  from rasmussen reports: voters are pretty convinced the moderators at the presidential debates scheduled to begin tonight will be helping hillary clinton more than donald trump. a new rasmussen reports national telephone and online survey finds that a plurality (46%) of likely u.s. voters believes most moderators will try to help clinton in the upcoming debates. only six percent (6%) think they will try to help trump instead. just 32% say most of the moderators will try to be unbiased, while 15% are undecided. (to see survey question wording, click here.) seventy-eight percent (78%) of voters who support trump think the moderators will try to help clinton. most clinton supporters (56%) say the moderators will try to be unbiased, but 20% say they’ll try to help their candidate. twelve percent (12%) of clinton voters think the moderators will try to help trump, compared to just two percent (2%) of trump supporters who feel that way. four years ago before the first debate between president obama and republican nominee mitt romney, 71% of republicans and 56% of unaffiliated voters said debate moderators are biased, but democrats by a 47% to 30% margin felt they were not biased. in 2008 before the first debate, 22% felt the first moderator, veteran pbs newsman jim lehrer, would try to help obama, while six percent (6%) expected him to help gop nominee john mccain. forty-three percent (43%) though lehrer would play a neutral role. this year’s debates are potentially a breakaway moment for either clinton or trump who have been running neck-and-neck for weeks in rasmussen reports’ white house watch survey. trump is ahead by five points in the latest survey, but it’s too early to say if he is gaining any traction over his rival. i consider everything out of both of their pieholes to be a lie, so i have no horse in this race. but, i am in it for the entertainment factor… sort of like eating popcorn during an apocalypse. frankly, i think this is trump’s to lose and i highly doubt he will. but i’m sure there are bookies out there laying odds on something going amiss with clinton: a potty emergency, fainting spell, seizure, brain freeze, coughing fit… any of those and she is toast. trump looks hale and hearty in comparison. this is the ultimate bread and circuses in america. behold an election as reality tv. and trump is known for saying, “you’re fired!” clinton may very well exit the show stage left tonight.        right before tonight’s debate hillary gets good news – moderators accused of…      
__label__1 in another revelation from wikileaks we find even more information! hillary has accepted donations from the head of a company who has also accepted donations from isis…good gosh, just when you think this vile woman couldn’t get any worse!   the company is french industrial giant lefarge, from which hillary accepted over $100,000.  let us also not forget this:  what is also shocking is that the city of paris signed contracts with this company, despite information linking them to the islamic state. thecanary.co reported on this shocking discovery: documents obtained by several journalistic investigations reveal that lafarge has paid taxes to the terror group to operate its cement plant in syria, and even bought isis oil for years. yet according to the campaign group, sumofus, lafarge is the corporate partner and sand provider to the city of paris for this summer’s paris-plages urban beach event. the project run by office of the mayor of paris, anne hidalgo, will create artificial beaches along the river seine in the centre and northeast of paris. lafarge also has close ties to democrat presidential candidate hillary clinton. apart from being a regular donor to the clinton foundation, clinton herself was a director of lafarge in the early 1990s, and did legal work for the firm in the 1980s. during her connection to lafarge, the firm was implicated in facilitating a cia-backed covert arms export network to saddam hussein. the report went on to confirm that the company’s paris office was well aware of the operations conducted with the islamic state for cement and oil transactions. lafarge bought oil for its own operations, but also allegedly supplied the islamic state with cement for its operations. you can’t sit on the fence with a terrorist organization, you’re either with them, or you’re not. you can’t have a middle ground because if you try to they will obliterate you. you don’t mess around with terrorists unless you are in clear support of them. hillary has borrowed over $100,000 from the very company who’s in support of isis, you know the group of crazy muslims that want us all dead. hillary clinton is a traitor.  unfortunately, the laws don’t apply to hitler…i mean hillary.      breaking: wikileak strikes again- reveals financial connection between hillary and isis!      
__label__1 we still can’t believe this devastating news!!! as of sunday evening, we have lost one of the most legendary men in our nation. arnold palmer has passed away at the age of 87 years old. many people were shocked upon hearing this news. the golfing community is obviously devastated by the loss of such a legendary man. upon hearing the news, the u.s. golf association released a saddening yet inspirational statement. “we are deeply saddened by the death of arnold palmer, golf’s greatest ambassador, at age 87,. arnold palmer will always be a champion, in every sense of the word. he inspired generations to love golf by sharing his competitive spirit, displaying sportsmanship, caring for golfers and golf fans, and serving as a lifelong ambassador for the sport.  our stories of him not only fill the pages of golf’s history books and the walls of the museum, but also our own personal golf memories.  the game is indeed better because of him, and in so many ways, will never be the same.” he was known as “the king of golf”, but was known for much more than that. palmer received many awards in the sport as well as outside the sport.  awards with high honors such as the presidential medal of freedom, the congressional gold medal, and more.  every time palmer accepted these awards, he offered some golf tips to whoever presented him with the awards…which was most of the time the president of the united states!  anyone who came into contact with him, golfer or not, immediately encountered a good time. he knew how to relate to everyone, no matter the age, occupation or position they were in life. palmer started out as an avid pilot who loved to play the game of golf. he attended wake forest college on a golf scholarship, which only grew his love for the sport even more. palmer won his first tour during his rookie season in 1955, and the rest is history. palmer brought a new attitude to golf. unlike the other players, he took risks and tried things that ultimately may have made him look crazy from time to time. he wasn’t your average straight laced golfer, and that’s what made him rise to stardom as well as success in the golf world.  palmer had a major influence on practically every golfer in the world. upon hearing the devastating news, american golfer, tiger woods, expressed how impactful palmer has been over the years. “arnold meant everything to golf. are you kidding me?. i mean, without his charisma, without his personality in conjunction with tv — it was just the perfect symbiotic growth. you finally had someone who had this charisma, and they’re capturing it on tv for the very first time. everyone got hooked to the game of golf via tv because of arnold.” arnold will be missed by many people from many walks of life, as numerous people of high status and beyond have already started to mourn. here's to the king who was as extraordinary on the links as he was generous to others. thanks for the memories, arnold. pic.twitter.com/ulyfpibol2 — president obama (@potus) september 26, 2016  i just got the news at about 8:45 that arnold had passed. i was shocked to hear that we lost a great friend (continued) pic.twitter.com/skehusqgww — jack nicklaus (@jacknicklaus) september 26, 2016  we’re praying for the many friends and family arnold has left behind. long live the legend who did way more than just play the sport of golf.       an american legend has just passed away, may god be with arnold palmer’s family      
__label__1 why in the hell do we still support saudi arabia? we don’t need their oil… we would make do. the majority of the 9/11 terrorists came from saudi arabia, as does the bin laden family. the saudi deputy crown prince told reporters in june the kingdom of saudi arabia has funded 20% of hillary clinton’s campaign. she’s taking money from a stone cold enemy and that’s not the only one by any means. you do not consort or take money from those who intend to destroy your country… period. that goes for middle eastern countries such as saudi arabia, russia, china, iran and north korea. it also includes any dictatorship or communist strongman. we never learn our lesson, do we? now it comes to light that saudi arabia is selling isis sex slaves off to the highest bidder at public auctions. iraqis, syrians, saudis and westerners all bought slaves at the auction. this is monstrous and going on right out in the open. it should be stopped cold… whatever it takes. britain needs to stop selling the saudis weapons and we need to pull our politicians out of the saudi bedroom and back home. they are killing us and enslaving women and children. how can we silently stand by while this evil goes on?  from jihad watch: it isn’t news that the islamic state has long been abusing and trafficking sex slaves – especially yazidi girls – but it has been now discovered that the sex slaves of is are being “sold in horrifying auctions to uk ally saudi arabia.” an eyewitness reported: dozens of women were being held in a large room, and it was not only iraqis and syrians trading women but also saudis and westerners, whose actual nationality was not clear. western women have also been reported to be among the victims in keeping with the islamic state’s practice of enslaving kafir women: the islamic state’s human trafficking operation includes enslaving women who they consider to be ‘kafir’, non-muslim people like yazidis and christians, before selling them for money. the depraved thugs are also involved in the radicalisation of young women all over the world and try to tempt them to come to their caliphate with false promises of wealth, marriage and forgiveness of sin. as these women are ‘rescued’ from isis, they are not being given freedom. they are being sold on the auction block into a hellish existence. these are the people that hillary clinton takes money from, makes deals with and hobnobs with. monsters of a feather. i have said for a long time, not only are the saudis sponsoring isis, so are the russians. we are being played. our own president is complicit. let’s not elect another corrupt demon who cares nothing of women and children being sold to rapists. after all, hillary clinton is married to one.        hillary’s top donor country just auctioned off isis sex slaves…      
__label__1 cities and towns across the nation are fighting obama’s refugee resettlement efforts to terraform and seed the nation with islamists. imperial beach is a suburb of san diego and the fighting citizens there want no part of it. mayor serge dedina issued a proclamation declaring imperial beach as a welcoming city. people have pretty much figured out that means sanctuary city and the muslims are being forced on their community. he just retracted the proclamation because a) he bypassed the city council and just did it and b) he pissed off most of the residents there. i don’t blame them for being mad. this fight can be won. the good people of imperial beach pushed back and won. all of us should be getting involved and doing the same in our individual communities. it’s a matter of safety, national security and survival. it only took a small, vocal group to make the mayor back down. that’s true patriotism and i’m heartened to see people taking a stand.  from 100percentfedup.com: last month, mayor serge dedina issued a proclamation, declaring imperial beach to be a “welcoming city.” the “welcoming communities” program is an obama initiative intended to resettle large numbers of refugees from syria, the rest of the middle east and latin america in cities and towns across america as part of his “fundamental transformation.” at the time, mayor dedina thought it was pretty harmless, but some people believe it goes deeper than that. they’re suspicious that the words, “welcoming city,” is another way of saying, “sanctuary city.” but mayor dedina says that a small town, and a relatively poor town, like imperial beach couldn’t handle such a thing, even if they wanted. but that’s not good enough for some skeptics. they want the proclamation erased. the mayor tried to claim the whole thing was a misunderstanding. sure it was. he knew exactly what he was doing. so now he comes off as a shifty liar as well. then he tried to dance on the subject and evade questions. typical sleazy politician. time to find a new mayor guys. refugee resettlement is being used to bring into america hundreds of thousands of islamic refugees and they are being settled in cities without telling the citizens. they bring mosques, sharia law, disease, intolerance, hatred and crime with them. combine that with illegal immigrants who are also being shipped all over america and you have the makings of a political coup. americans must stand up and fight back or we will lose our country and our freedom through these marxist programs.              this small town fought against refugee resettlement – and won!

__label__1 this is just getting pathetic. a restaurant owner in florida took exception to hillary’s “basket of deplorables” remark. so on his sign outside, he made a statement: nra member… concealed carry ok… not a deplorable… vote trump. this enraged hillary clinton supporters who began to mobilize to protest the restaurant. you would think that would actually be a threat since she has 57 offices in the state of florida and trump has six. you would be wrong. the owner of the restaurant, bill davis, called trump supporters and they decided to counter the clinton mob even though they had a 24-hour head start. it wasn’t even a contest. 16 clinton supporters showed… over 100 trump supporters made them look weak to say the least. florida is a must-win state for clinton. looks to me as if she is in serious trouble there.  from top right news: a restaurant owner in florida decided to post a sign in favor of trump, hillary clinton’s local office immediately rallied supporters to protest on facebook. but when they got there, the democrats found themselves outnumbered — more than 5-to-1 — by trump fans. bill davis, owner of the seafood restaurant barnicle bill’s in sarasota, was upset with hillary’s description of trump supporters as “a basket of deplorables.” so he decided to post a sign supporting the gop nominee:  the sign reads: nra member concealed carry ok not a deplorable vote trump the first debate is tonight and my money is on trump walking away with it. clinton is terrible in a debate and the trump persona will literally overshadow and dwarf the hildabeast on stage. trump is leading clinton in florida… shows of support like this must terrify hillary and that is sure to be uppermost in her mind when she scales that stage tonight. clinton has outspent trump 5 to 1 and is still losing. and although the polls still show her with a minor edge on winning the election, that is bound to change at this rate. the worm is turning and in the final stretch, trump could leave her in the political dust of history. if trump walks away in the debate tonight, clinton will be all but finished. if she has a potty attack, a seizure, a brain freeze, a stroke or a fainting spell… well, trump can start picking out drapes for the white house. trump’s followers have enthusiasm and passion for their candidate. hillary can’t even get a soul to show up to go door to door for her. her crowds have been underwhelming to say the least. barring the rigging of the election, it looks like donald trump will be the next president of the united states.         video: hillary supporters protest restaurant’s pro-trump sign – didn’t realize who was watching…      
__label__1 as most of our readers are well aware, there has been immense speculation recently regarding the health status of democrat presidential nominee hillary clinton. following in the wake of clinton’s near collapse at the 9/11 memorial service earlier this month, some have suggested that clinton may be suffering from some sort of neurological disorder that is causing her to have dizzy spells and difficulty walking or standing, particularly when dealing with steps. there is sure to be renewed speculation in that regard following a bit of video that emerged sunday via a twitter post from clinton pool reporter and abc news journalist liz kreutz, who happened to catch clinton as she was leaving a building in new york city, according to the conservative treehouse. clinton was exiting the appleseeds kids center and preparing to descend a set of stairs when kreutz approached, camera rolling, and began to ask questions of the candidate.  clinton just left "apple seeds" kids center in flatiron. feeling good about debate? "getting ready, getting ready!" pic.twitter.com/mxxbbmivcu — liz kreutz (@abcliz) september 25, 2016  as can be seen in the video, clinton seemingly ignored the reporter’s first questions, instead remaining intently focused on grabbing the handrail and her footing on the steps as she descended. once she was about three-quarters of the way down the stairs, only then did clinton turn her attention to the reporter, flashing a sudden smile but continuing to ignore the questions, replying with only “getting ready” when pressed about her preparedness for the first presidential debate monday evening. she then carefully hoisted herself up into her special campaign van, without any assistance, though a secret service agent stood ready to perhaps lend a hand right behind her. while it is entirely plausible that clinton didn’t see or hear the reporter until she had reached the bottom of the steps, this video clip will likely still serve as further proof that she is suffering from some sort of medical issues that make it difficult for her to walk up and down stairs. the video certainly reinforces the supposition that clinton suffers from selective hearing, picking and choosing which questions she will acknowledge and answer while ignoring others that may prove difficult or too revealing for her. please share this on facebook and twitter so that everyone can see hillary clinton seemingly struggle in her effort to successfully descend a flight of stairs, so much so that she virtually ignored a reporter standing and watching in close proximity. what do you think of the apparently extra-careful manner in which hillary clinton was spotted descending a small set of stairs? scroll down to comment below!      breaking: reporter ambushes hillary on steps, catches what she’s hiding on tape

__label__1 this is just disgraceful. texas… you can do better than this. a judge took to facebook to vent her feelings after seeing a police officer named sgt. demetrick pennie sue black lives matter and others for causing disparagement of police and causing racial division. he also charges their actions led to the deaths of five officers in dallas and others across the country. for that, this judge called him a clueless slave. others on her facebook page called him derogatory names and went to town on the officer. one of them was a texas state representative, if you can believe it. sergeant pennie recently petitioned the federal court to expedite his case due to the incoming threats received. everything is about race now and cop-hatred. i don’t even recognize my country anymore. andrea martin, 304th district court judge in dallas county (d), should be removed from the bench permanently. she is supposed to be non-partisan, unbiased and fair as a judge. she is obviously not. she should be reported to the state bar and held accountable.  from breitbart: a texas judge likened a black dallas police sergeant to a clueless slave in response to the cop’s lawsuit against black lives matter and its high-profile supporters. andrea martin, 304th district court judge in dallas county (d), told her network of friends on facebook saturday that sgt. demetrick pennie was like a slave that harriet tubman could not free because he could not comprehend his own bondage. the post elicited a number of supporters to judge martin’s sentiment, typically calling pennie a “coon” and other derisive messages. a sitting texas state representative apparently joined the racialist banter as well.  martin’s thoughts led others to compare pennie to a “coon”, “judas” and samuel l. jackson’s house slave character “stephen” in the 2012 film, django unchained. the derisive comments were repeatedly cheered by martin’s lines of “laughing-so-hard-i’m-crying” emojis and others.     texas state representative eric johnson (d – dallas, mesquite) also appears to join in with a “stephen” reference via his facebook account. judge martin currently serves in the 304th juvenile district court. she originally graduated from texas wesleyan university school of law in 2000 and later worked for the dallas county district attorney as a general prosecutor and subsequently represented child protective services. texas state representative eric johnson (d – dallas, mesquite) should be recalled immediately as well. such behavior is unbecoming of a state leader. these people are stone cold racists and they are pushing bigotry and hate. these are the sentiments and comments that tear communities apart. they are extremely destructive. all elected officeholders should be held accountable for their racially-derogatory language.        judge compares dallas police officer who’s suing blacklivesmatter to a slave…      
__label__1 media outlets have made it official: just before tonight’s first 2016 presidential debate, republican presidential candidate donald j. trump is leading! democrats were recently ready to measure the drapes in the white house. but according to bloomberg politics, clinton’s once seemly insurmountable lead has officially “collapsed.” as bloomberg reports: donald trump and hillary clinton are locked in a tied two-way race for the presidency as they head to hofstra university in new york on monday night for one of the most highly anticipated debates in modern politics. the republican and democratic nominees each get 46 percent of likely voters in a head-to-head contest in the latest bloomberg politics national poll, while trump gets 43 percent to clinton’s 41 percent when third-party candidates are included. clinton faces higher expectations as tens of millions of people tune in for a television spectacle that could reach super bowl viewership levels. about half, 49 percent, say they anticipate the former secretary of state will perform better, while 39 percent say that for trump, a real-estate developer and former tv personality and, hillary has lost support among women and younger millennial voters: ann selzer, the iowa-based pollster who oversaw the survey, said there are signs that clinton’s margins with women and young voters have eroded over the past three months, helping to explain trump’s gains. new national bloomberg poll just released – thank you! join the movement: https://t.co/3kwol2ibaw. #trumptrain #maga pic.twitter.com/4kqx4pmt0i — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) september 26, 2016  in addition, pollsters noted that more of trump’s voters are excited to vote for him than hillary voters are about voting for her. it’s clear that hillary clinton’s ongoing criminal activity, the questionable ways she became wealthy, and her ongoing health struggles have doomed a campaign that once looked invincible. the clinton political machine that used to control the message through the liberal media in the 1990s simply can’t hide from today’s alternative media. hillary clinton is being exposed, and voters are paying attention. this is what hillary clinton’s poll numbers look like today: what do you think about hillary clinton’s collapse in the polls? please leave us a comment (below) and tell us what you think.        site navigation once leading in the polls, hillary clinton has collapsed!      
__label__1 like father like daughter. just sayin’. on the day that al sharpton is due here in tulsa to try and gin up riots, i read that his daughter has run into a snag on her $5 million lawsuit against new york city. you see, once upon a time, two years ago, dominique sharpton decided to cross the street in the big apple. she claims she stepped into a pothole and heard a loud snap. and so commenced sharpton jr’s lawfare. there seems to be a number of problems with dominique’s lawsuit and her attempt at becoming an instant millionaire. first off, when she went to the emergency room, nothing was broken. drat! but she sued anyway citing physical therapy and emotional distress. she had to exist in a therapeutic boot and have ligament surgery… allegedly. but of course, that’s not the end of the story by a long shot.  from the independent review journal: nearly two years ago, on october 2nd, 2014, sharpton said that she suffered an injury while crossing the street in new york city. she says that she stepped into a pothole in the street at the intersection of broome st. and broadway, at which point she heard “a snap.” soon afterward, sharpton pursued a lawsuit against the city, citing continued pain and suffering. her medical records showed a visit to the emergency room (nothing was broken), physical therapy, some time in a therapeutic boot, and ligament surgery. but as the details of her $5 million lawsuit came out, people began to notice that she wasn’t exactly behaving like someone who was in constant pain: sharpton was dancing at her father’s 60th birthday celebration just hours after her horrific accident… in high heels. she’s made constant trips to miami to be with her love interest and best of all… she went hiking in bali. a judge has now ordered she cannot delete the photos that she stupidly posted to instagram. double drat!! it’s getting harder and harder for a budding shyster to make a living these days. dominique claimed that she could only wear heels for a very short period of time. on her hike in bali, she claims you couldn’t see that she was helped constantly by comrades and had to take frequent breaks. my heart breaks, i tell ya. she also lamented her inability to “dive off a diving board, go skiing, or go run marathons.” now comes the hysterical part… when city attorney michelle fox asked sharpton if she had been a marathon runner prior to her accident, sharpton replied: “not necessarily. but if i, you know, if i needed to do it and i was exercising or something like that, i was capable of it. now, i can’t.” it sounds like a very bad joke, but unfortunately it is not. the judge should dismiss this frivolous lawsuit and send sharpton a bill. tell her daddy he can pay for it… he won’t. he never does pay his bills and corruption is a family pastime.         al sharpton’s daughter sues nyc for 5 mil over ankle injury, but look what she’s done on her ankle

__label__1 is it just me or has there been a rash of teachers behaving poorly across the nation? maybe it’s always existed, but now because of social media, it comes out faster. whatever the reason for the seeming increase of crappy educators, we can all agree that it’s not okay for anyone to call our kids “racists” for any reason. period. end of discussion.  veronica welsh of smithtown, ny called her students “racist” for doing absolutely nothing racist. they weren’t using racial slurs, they weren’t excluding minorities from their clubs, teams, groups, etc. they weren’t doing anything except, wait for it, wearing pro-trump gear on usa day. these teachers are just part of a growing group of increasingly-liberal educators that have our children 7-8 hours a day. if this doesn’t frighten you, then you’re not paying attention. the smithtown superintendent called the act: “…an extremely unfortunate incident and these actions are not promoted by the smithtown central school district administration and board of education, nor do they reflect the attitudes of our students and staff.” of course when people get caught being jerks to others, they preach about their first amendment rights and complain about the repercussions of their actions. let’s not get into the fact that the first amendment protects you from the government, not from being fired from your job for saying something outrageous. are you being imprisoned? no? alrighty then, you’re exercising your first amendment rights and we’re exercising our right to hit back against your rhetoric. but let’s look into what punishment this teacher faced, because i think you might be surprised to hear what happened to her almost immediately after this nasty facebook post hit the web. the smithtown superintendent said that veronica walsh has been sanctioned and “administratively reassigned.” gotta love that karma bus. it’s going to be a difficult road trying to get another job in education with a history that is currently all over the news.       high school teacher calls trump-supporting students ‘racists’ on facebook & gets instant karma      
__label__1 millions of americans nationwide are upset with the black lives matter movement because they only appear after a widely publicized cop-on-citizen shooting. it would appear, based on just that alone, that they are only in it for the media attention and the money that comes along with that. of course, there is also the looting and rioting and burning of private property, but they don’t want us to focus on that because racism or something.  a 15 year-old kid was found burnt and tossed in a garbage can. he was the kind of kid that every parent hopes for, helping out neighbors by walking their dogs, always following curfew and was always good-natured. but on september 16th, demetrius griffin jr. didn’t come home at curfew. that is when his mother realized something was very, very wrong. after his body was found, his mother and aunt pleaded with the community to come forward with any information they had about his murder(ers). ‘what i need this community to understand is when you took this baby’s life you affected this whole family. you didn’t just take his life. and if you’re out here and you see this and you’re listening, look at what you did to this family.” when his aunt virginia riley took to the microphone, she called out black lives matter, who has been noticeably silent during this whole case. “don’t turn your back this time, y’all. we really need to find the solution or real, i mean, if you all talk about ‘black lives matter,’ this life did matter.“ unfortunately, this is just one of the 500 murders that have taken place in chicago during 2016 alone. without a doubt, this is one of the most heartbreaking cases of murder that the country has ever seen, but it will fade from the headlines soon enough. the nation will forget young demetrius’ face, but a family and a community will be affected forever. they will have to walk to the mailbox remembering when demetrius would walk the neighborhood dogs around the block. they will continue living in the house filled with his laughter and memories of his adorable face and piercing blue eyes. black lives do matter, just as much as every other life on the planet. this young boy had his life ripped from him by a thug who doesn’t know what it is to love someone more than you love yourself. we need to make it a point to keep stories like this in the headlines until it is solved and the creature or creatures who did this are behind bars.       family of burned chicago teen left in trash can has message for those saying ‘black lives matter’      
__label__1 it’s true that conservatives have a tendency to take the opinions of reality stars with many grains of salt, especially because they have a tendency to be mindlessly liberal and ill-informed. brody jenner, however, has said something worth sharing. brody is the son of caitlyn (then bruce) jenner and actress linda thompson, and stars in “the hills,” a show that i’ve never seen and for which i can give you no description.   twitter exploded after brody jenner posted a comment on instagram claiming that not everything is about race. of course, adding “all lives matter” was pretty much the end of it. the perpetually-offended crowd took to their keyboards to let him know that he’s a terrible person because he’s white and a man, and straight and “cis-gender.” below is the offending post: “i normally don’t speak about this type of stuff, but this is just ridiculous. i can’t even watch the news anymore without getting pissed off. this has nothing to do with race. white, black, brown, any color…if you have an officer of the law telling you to exit your vehicle (or do anything for that matter)…you comply. and not only do you comply, but you do so willingly and follow directions completely. and why in the world would you exit that vehicle with a weapon in hand (allegedly?!) that makes no sense! and if, let’s just say, you don’t have a gun, why would you not put your hands up in the air and state “i do not have a gun” so that the officers can clearly see that you don’t??” after receiving backlash, he posted another photo on instagram, salting the wounds of the whining babies on the left.  predictably, liberals lost their ever-loving minds over this, but it’s honestly just par for the course with these people. they are always looking for something by which they can be offended.       liberals are furious when reality star brody jenner tells the truth about police shootings on twitter      
__label__1 for many americans, the choice they make on their ballots in november has everything to do with the role the next president will play in shaping our supreme court. conservatives have emphasized how important it is that we elect someone who will fight for and preserve our constitutional rights by nominating justices who follow in the footsteps of the late antonin scalia. both donald trump and hillary clinton have laid out their plans for the country if elected, but, as pointed out by conservative evangelical leader franklin graham, only one candidate has released a list of potential supreme court nominees — trump. “the public needs to recognize that this presidential election is not about personalities the way the media is trying to make it sound,” graham wrote in a facebook post monday. the prominent religious leader argued, instead, that this presidential election is about filling the supreme court vacancy with someone who will follow the u.s. constitution. “this court and their rulings on issues of religious freedom, marriage, abortion, and much more will impact this country for our lifetime and the lifetime of our children and grandchildren,” graham wrote. “there’s so much on the line here.” pointing out that the next president would nominate at least one justice — and potentially several more — over the next four years, graham asked his friends to “pray about who to vote for.” but, he also challenged us to educate ourselves on the candidate’s potential supreme court nominees, so we will know where they stand on the future of the nation’s highest court — something that is possible with only one candidate, trump, because clinton has not released a list of names she would consider.  on friday, trump released his most recent update to a list of potential supreme court nominees, and it included a highly qualified and diverse field of candidates that is sure to satisfy conservatives and freedom-loving voters across the country. meanwhile, we’re left to simply speculate about which anti-gun, anti-life and anti-religious freedom justice clinton would nominate. that’s a scary thought, folks, and a risk not worth taking. like and share on facebook and twitter if you agree with franklin graham that the supreme court is the most important issue of this election. which candidate do you trust more to nominate justices who respect the constitution? scroll down to comment below!      franklin graham reveals 1 thing trump did before debate that hillary did not do      
__label__1 everyone knows arnold palmer as being a spectacular golfer and the inventor of a drink that is a mix of lemonade and iced tea. (i personally thank him for the last one, because i am in love with arnold palmers, especially in the summer months.)  aside from being a great athlete, palmer was also a great american, as evidenced by his comments about the star spangled banner. “we don’t play ‘the star-spangled banner’ enough during the matches, and that is one of the things i think we need to do,” palmer said then. “it’s a patriotic situation, and it belongs to both sides,” palmer added. these comments came after the national football league saw the beginning of the sitting protests that have sparked so much outrage. this weekend, we saw desean jackson of the washington redskins greet our national anthem with a raised fist, which is being used as a symbol of solidarity with the black community. he later made a statement on instagram: “no matter how much or what we stand 4 as black people this will continue to happen , another love 1 is taking from his family and killed unarmed , when will this s— stop , this man was shot & killed for what ?? was he a threat ?? us as black people are a threat , so jus take our lives smh the system been set up for us not to live and make it thru all this bull—- another rip #terrencecrutcher but they say have faith & trust ?? in what them to keep killing our love 1’s,” he posted. the giants played washington that weekend and all of the players stood for the anthem. later, he questioned whether these gestures on the field are actually being turned into actions. “does anybody want to resolve the issues? that’s what we have to find out,” said running back rashad jennings. “we’re talking about gestures. the gesture of taking a knee, the gesture of posting something (on social media). those are all gestures. it’s whether the actions are taking place,” he said. we need more athletes like palmer who love their sport and love the country that has made their life and lifestyle possible.       golfing legend arnold palmer said this about the star spangled banner in one of his last interviews      
__label__1 so here is a moral question, are you responsible for telling your partner you have an std or is it only if they ask? or is your partner responsible for keeping themselves clean? apparently jim carrey’s ex-girlfriend committed suicide after contracting a sexually transmitted disease and/or infection from him. carrey found out that he is being sued for her wrongful death by her estranged husband.   according to the reports, he’s being sued for illegally acquiring pain killers that were found in her body and were eventually ruled to be her cause of death. he denied the claims that he gave her three stds, herpes 1&2 and gonnorhea. now, a handwritten letter has been made public that details the torture that cathriona white faced after she contracted the diseases. say: ‘i gave you this, intentional or not, i gave it to you. i understand that this is something that will affect you for the rest of your life and future relationships. what can make this right?’ instead of that, i was disrespected, degraded, called a whore, an opportunist, threatened, our relationship belittled. …and i don’t really think you can see. like it’s not an issue to you. i’m just an ungrateful bitch who you’ve done so much for and i took advantage. that simply is not true. picking myself back up emotionally and mentally is one thing, people have bad experience and break-ups, it’s hard but with time they move on, meet someone new, start over. add in disease. how does someone move on and meet someone new? …i am damaged. i am disgusting. when i shower i feel sick. getting turned on…what’s that? certainly not something that happens (to) me any more. i will always be damaged goods and have a stigma attached. so i have to accept something i was always afraid of. being alone. being abandoned and alone.” the closing of her letter is perhaps the most heartbreaking part of the whole thing, and honestly, it made me cry. “be good to yourself. i will always have love in my heart for you. i pray that you are content and have peace in your life and in your soul.” it takes a big person to wish well the very person who is the reason she is so miserable that she took her own life. whose side are you on, team carrey or team white?       letter from jim carrey’s girlfriend who killed herself reveals torment over contracting stds from him      
__label__1 hillary clinton had a major slip up on thursday. in a public video message to american laborers, democrat presidential candidate hillary clinton put her true personality on full display! it was just what would expect from the little she-devil: shrill, manic and apt to inspire shudders of trepidation in little children. “‘why aren’t i 50 points ahead?’ you might ask,” hillary bellowed like an asylum patient. “well, the choice for working families has never been clearer. i need your help to get donald trump’s record out to everybody.” “nobody should be fooled!” she snidely added in a voice so ear-splittingly loud that even deaf laborers most likely heard it. throughout the rest of the video, she maintained that same flair — the unnecessary indignation for her opponent, gop candidate donald trump. to her demise, instead of directing her rage at him, she inadvertently wound up unleashing it upon the very people she wanted to bubble her name in on the ballot. you can watch a snippet of the video below, just a tip, don’t watch it in front of your kids, lest they go to sleep tonight complaining about the “hillary bogeywoman” hiding in their closets:  that is one frightening old lady!! does she actually think that’s going to win her votes? take note to this version of hillary clinton compared to the one usually seen of her. when speaking at campaign events or with the media, she attempts (rather unsuccessfully) to present herself as amiable, humble and, of course, likable.  the hillary depicted in the clip above is much more like the version of her described by her former secret service escorts. take for example former agent gary byrne, who described the former first lady as “erratic, uncontrollable and occasionally violent.” this hillary definitely fits the bill of the heartless benghazi murdering type we have read so much about! even byrne admitted that hillary often screamed obscenities at secret service agents, white house staff and even her own husband, former president bill clinton. and everyone lived in fear of her next crazy outburst. that sounds spot on….        watch: the real hillary just got captured on camera… arms flailing, eyes bulging, furious voice

__label__1 denver broncos' linebacker brandon marshall lost another endorsement over his controversial protest against the national anthem. centurylink followed air academy federal credit union in withdrawing support for marshall, the denver post reports. the company said that while it respects his right as an american to show his dissent, his actions conflict with its values. "while we acknowledge brandon’s right, we also believe that whatever issues we face, we also occasionally must stand together to show our allegiance to our common bond as a nation," wrote centurylink in a statement. "in our view, the national anthem is one of those moments. for this reason, while we wish brandon the best this season, we are politely terminating our agreement with him.” inspired by 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick, marshall decided to kneel during the national anthem before the nfl game as a protest against police brutality and racism, bet reports.  “i’m against social injustice. i’m not against the military, the police or america at all. i’m against social injustice,” marshall explained. “people that aren’t minorities, they don’t know what it’s like to be a minority in this country,” he added. “and i’m not saying it’s terrible. i love this country. we have great opportunities, but at the same time, if you’re not a minority you don’t understand. i speak for everybody when i say that, because i know they agree with me." since then, marshall has experienced intense backlash, ranging from withdrawal of endorsements to loss of fans. one man even set an orange shirt with marshall's name on it ablaze.  despite the criticism, the once fan-favorite marshall has no regrets, will kneel again during the sept. 15 game, and says he sends love to all. "it’s cool, because people can call me the n-word or cuss or at me or say they wish i’d break my neck all they want," he said.

"they went out to the airport and left, but they never arrived in seattle," joyce told abc 6. "so for many many years, we didn't know what had happened." now, more than half a century later, joyce has received a very special gift that belonged to her mother: her wedding ring. the ring was discovered by nick buchanan, a washington logger who came across it near the crash site. buchanan wanted to find the rightful owner of the ring, and with the help of his nephew and ancestry.com they were able to track down joyce who lives all the way across the country in new jersey.  buchanan called joyce to tell her he had found the ring and wanted to return it to her. "he said 'joyce, i have your mother's ring, and i've been looking for you all these years and i want you to have this,'" joyce said. it took buchanan years before he found joyce, but his determination paid off.  "my mouth was open," joyce said. "i couldn't believe what i was hearing...it restores your faith in human nature, because there's so many bad things happening. and yet there are good people out there, kind people. people persevere.

__label__1 this is one that will have you proud that protectors and sheepdogs don’t give a hoot about the color of skin. a schoolyard fight was caught on camera again, but it goes down quite differently than what you would expect, based off the first couple seconds of the brutal recording. one part that will have you disgusted with the tactics used by two bullies and another part will reveal that racist hate groups like blacklivesmatter and the new black panthers aren’t as influential as the liberal media would have you believe.  you are going to witness how the color of one’s skin doesn’t keep you segregated as these hate groups would have you think and believe. as the clip opens up, a white male student is seated at a bench on school property, playing with his phone, when all of the sudden, two black students swing on him from behind. the first punch lands square on the kid’s jaw and he’s left with the only option of curling up in a defensive position. the two bullies are throwing punches as fast as they can, hitting their victim anywhere they can connect. all seems lost for the victim at first…until two students, one male and one female, step in to even the odds and protect the defenseless boy. oh, and guess what? they’re black.   now, it shouldn’t be a surprise to the majority of americans living today that these two good samaritans would stick up for another white student. the color of one’s skin isn’t a measure of the heart and if you don’t believe that, you are either a progressive racist, or you are an elderly racist living out life in the past. that’s not american. these two sheepdogs didn’t give a crap about the color of skin. they saw a sheep being devoured by wolves and they came roaring in to protect him. these two are truly heroes.       video: white boy gets help from an unlikely hero while being jumped by two guys

__label__1 there shouldn’t be an estate tax period. right now the rate stands at 40%. if hillary clinton gets her way, she’ll raise it to a whopping 65% and i would not be surprised to see it go even higher. we are being taxed to death and hillary loves taxes. taxation equals slavery… it is enforced compliance and i view it as unconstitutional. but these rules don’t apply to elitists such as the clintons who are now definitely in the top 1% of the wealthy out there. they have several tax shelters that keep this from applying to them. isn’t that nice? i guess when they kick off, they want to make sure that chelsea gets their wealth. but it isn’t just the estate tax with these people… they have accounting methods that shield them from almost all taxation.  from breitbart: hillary clinton wants to increase the estate tax to 65 percent on the wealthiest americans, according to her latest tax plan. the clinton campaign estimates that the increase would raise an addition $75 billion in revenue over the next decade. the current rate maxes out at 40 percent. but hillary clinton and her husband bill have created a number of tax shelters in recent years to dramatically limit their payment of the very same tax. as bloomberg reported back in 2014: “to reduce the tax pinch, the clintons are using financial planning strategies befitting the top 1 percent of u.s. households in wealth.” in 2010 the clinton created “residential trusts” and the following year moved their chappaqua estate into the trust, according to their financial records. as david scott sloan, a partner at the firm holland knight explained the clinton trust to cbs news, “you’re creating things that are going to be on the nontaxable side of the balance sheet when they die.” the move will save the clintons hundreds of thousands of dollars in estate taxes, according to accountants quoted by bloomberg. these types of taxation shelters are common among the wealthy. they do not typically apply to the rest of us. if clinton could get away with it, she would impose a 100% tax rate. in essence, they are already doing that by using multiple layers of taxation. creative accounting seems to only apply to the wealthy. those who see themselves as above the rule of law. just as clinton skated on the email scandal and other felonies, she has found a way to shelter her wealth. she’s also adept at money laundering. she’s a multi-talented corrupt barracuda and should be in prison, not running for the presidency.        hillary clinton says higher estate taxes for everyone, except her family…      
__label__1 toby keith has been forced to cancel his show in south carolina and it was totally unexpected. toby keith was scheduled to perform at the florence civic center in south carolina on september 22 and he was forced to cancel. unfortunately the night before the concert toby keith sent out an update to all of his fans sharing the heartbreaking news.  the good news is that toby keith didn’t have to cancel his concert because he was ill or hurt. the bad news is that there are huge fuel shortages in south carolina and the gas prices are continuing to rise in the southeast. the general manager of the florence civic center,kendall wall, shared that the venue had received many messages from fans stating that they weren’t going to be able to make it because of the fuel cancern. both keith’s managers and the florence civic center decided that it was best for the fans if the concert was postponed to a later date. they wanted it to be fair for everyone who had already purchased their tickets. “this is a major show for the region which attracts fans within a one- to two-hour drive and beyond…we understand the growing concerns for toby’s fans and our own fans, as we’ve been receiving distress messages over the past couple days…it would be unfair for these fans and unrealistic for them to travel given the current dismal situation with gas prices and availability.”  the rescheduled concert date is march 7,2017 and the tickets will be honored for that concert. if any fan is unable to make the rescheduled concert date, there will be refunds made but only for a short amount of time. toby keith is one of the most respected country artists and we hope that those fans who could have made the concert are understanding of the cancelation.  i’m glad that everyone is okay, but it is such a bummer that these things have to happen. pray for south carolina!      breaking: toby keith forced to cancel show, i didn’t expect this      
__label__1 imagine that… at least 70% of the rioters in charlotte, north carolina were bused in. they had out of state ids. looks like it was well planned. i know here in tulsa, hubby had to leave work early yesterday. we got word that black lives matter was busing people into tulsa as well. in our case, things stayed pretty peaceful fortunately. they weren’t so lucky in charlotte. the head of the police union there came right out and said these were professional criminals that were brought in. this is the way the communists have organized these protests from the beginning. wait for something to happen that causes outrage. use the black community as useful tools for your agenda. bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. the people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. charlotte was a wild success for them… tulsa, not so much.  from louder with crowder: wait, the bulk of the people rioting in north carolina are coming from out of state? shut up. generally speaking when there’s a riot like this, it’s all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they’re even rioting about in the first place. no, no, that’s not sarcasm. shut up. take it away cnn…   “this is not charlotte that’s out here. these are outside entities that are coming in and causing these problems. these are not protestors, these are criminals.” “we’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. they were coming in on buses from out of state. if you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. i can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state ids. they’re not coming from charlotte.” i think the reason it did not work here in tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to black lives matter. also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with manslaughter. i still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. charlotte has a large black lives matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. it’s not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda. these people don’t care about the facts or that black people are dying. they are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. that’s their goal… it’s part of wanting to burn all of america down. it’s what communists do – they want their revolution and race wars and they want them now.       surprise! 70% of charlotte rioters are not from there – guess what that means… [video]

__label__1 as idiots like colin kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in charlotte, nc took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters. that says a lot and shows a huge difference. one is self-centered and obsessed over perceived slights, the other focuses on faith and god. a picture was taken by the north carolina troopers association of these officers praying. it went viral almost immediately and with good reason. this is who we are. radicals were bused into charlotte to create havoc and violent chaos. they were also bused into tulsa yesterday. we were fortunate here in that prayer prevailed and the protests were mostly peaceful. charlotte was not so fortunate. i saw good people stand between the protesters and police trying to stop the radicals. i saw them kneel in the street praying that it would stop. faith in god is colorblind… racism and violence are not of god.  from the independent review journal: but after an officer-involved shooting in charlotte left 43-year-old keith lamont scottdead, another photo of people “taking a knee” began to circulate on social media. these people weren’t on their knees in protest, however. they were on their knees in prayer.  the photo, originally posted by the north carolina troopers association, was shared nearly 100,000 times in less than 24 hours and included the following caption: “north carolina state troopers having a word of fellowship and prayer before being deployed on the streets of charlotte. please keep them in your thoughts and prayers as they work to protect us and help the city rebuild.” and the troopers weren’t alone. there were a number of people who took a knee in the streets, filling the gap between protesters and police:  people in memphis knelt and bowed their heads as well. there were prayers said across the country and you know what? race didn’t matter. there are a few people making this ugly and rioting in the streets. they are for the most part useful idiots egged on and controlled by marxists whether they know it or not. i was heartened to see the rapid response team from billy graham’s ministry there… they are good people of faith and are greatly needed in charlotte right now. we need to turn away from this hate and division and turn towards god. he is the only one who will lead us out of this. i’m so very proud of these police officers… they have their priorities straight. black lives matter is not a good group… they prefer violence and hatred, as opposed to prayer and faith.          nc state troopers take a knee before protecting charlotte – but it wasn’t to protest the national anthem…      
__label__1 during the violent protests in charlotte, nc, a protester shot into the crowd there. he wound up shooting justin carr in the head. at first the media reported he had died… justin did not die until last night – he was on life support. this morning, the police apprehended the man they think killed him… rayquan borum. there are those saying the police killed justin with rubber bullets. i don’t believe that at all. surveillance video shows borum shooting the gun that killed justin. lay blame where blame is due. the shooting happened the second night of the protests in charlotte. it was an awful, bloody scene. i don’t know why anyone would just fire into the crowd like that. it makes no sense. someone was bound to be hit and die. maybe the guy just didn’t care. a white man was also kicked and beaten brutally in a garage by the protesters there. so much violence over a justified shooting by a black police officer. it’s as if facts don’t matter… they just want revolution in the streets.  from the federalist papers project: the several nights of chaos in charlotte, north carolina led to the death of a man who was present at the protests; his name was justin carr. he was shot on wednesday night and and died thursday morning. amid the chaos, it was difficult to tell exactly what happened. all we have known up until this point was that one of the protesters fired on carr and that his injuries led to his death. however, there are new developments out of charlotte. fox news has more: rayquan borum, 21, was charged friday morning in shooting death of justin carr, who died a day after being shot during protests in trade street, charlotte-mecklenberg police chief kerr putney said. putney said surveillance footage supplied by buildings in the area helped identify the suspect. the shooting occurred wednesday night, and charlotte police initially said the man had died, although he survived on life support until thursday. witnesses gave conflicting accounts about who shot him, with some insisting they saw police gun him down with rubber bullets, while others said he was killed by a fellow protester.  who will protest for justin carr? certainly not black lives matter. to them, he is a war casualty. they’ll just step over his body and riot on. there will be no marches or demands for justice for justin. these people use others and then discard their dead bodies as they go. it’s the communist, radical way. they are now trying to lay the blame for justin carr’s death on the police. i don’t believe it and won’t until i see video proving it. it is far more likely it is the guy that has been arrested. my only question is did someone pay him to shoot things up?  new: charlotte police chief says they've apprehended suspect in murder of justin carr, who was shot during protests. https://t.co/b29wwib7wa — abc news (@abc) september 23, 2016            breaking news: arrest made in death of charlotte protester – details [video]      
__label__1 mark another university off your list… the university of vermont this week flew the black lives matter flag beside the american flag and their state flag. no word on whether next week it will be the isis flag or not, but it wouldn’t surprise me at this point. so, now our schools of so-called higher education are teaching that a terrorist group that pushes violence and racism should be respected as much as the american flag and our founding fathers. that is just obscene in the extreme. if this is symbolic support of their community, i want no part of any of them.  from gateway pundit: it’s an obama world… the university of vermont this week flew the “black lives matter” terrorist flag beside the american flag on campus. this is what they are teaching america’s children today on college campuses– that a terrorist flag is to be respected and the american flag is to be disrespected. campus reform reported: the university of vermont’s burlington campus is flying a black lives matter flag alongside both the american and state flags. several students from the school took to social media to express their support for the move, with some saying the school is “winning for this” and another noting that since the school is supportive of the movement, “we should be too.” one local news outlet is reporting that the flag is being sponsored by the school’s student government association (sga), whose president called the move a way to “show symbolic support for our community.” the flag is being sponsored by the uvm student government association. they should be ashamed of themselves. the flag apparently appeared on campus the day after the start of the riots in charlotte, which have now taken one life and injured about a dozen police officers and a number of protesters. many students at the school are saying they are happy to see the blm flag on their campus, with some even saying they would like to see the flag stay up on campus “forever.” i guess i should not be surprised. vermont is uber liberal. not everyone thought it was keen… “the university is known for being very liberal, but this statement of support for black lives matter goes beyond anything that can be excused,” one student, who did not wish to be identified, told campus reform. “a public university, funded by the taxpayers…has no right to make such a blatant political statement. it is inappropriate for a public university, where opinions and views are supposed to be freely expressed, as blm is known…to stifle free speech.” that flagpole can evidently be sponsored by any student organization for any cause. this one is revolutionary and violent.        university now flying ‘black lives matter’ flag alongside u.s. flag on campus…      
__label__1 i’m so disappointed by this. we mentioned this on our show earlier this week, but the perpetually offended brigade set their sights on disney’s maui halloween costume, calling it “brownface” and disrespectful to polynesian cultures, and cultural appropriation, and probably a bunch of other stupid things that only perpetually offended losers get bent out of shape about. here’s the maui character from the upcoming disney film moana.  perhaps you remember the outrage from a couple months ago, when people decided they were also angry that the maui character is fat.  if you missed that story, here you go.  in that post, we are reminded that maui is a demi-god character in an animated fictional disney movie.  and yet, people are still mad. but the outrage went even further, because now people are mad about the maui halloween costume.  here’s what it looks like:  infuriating, huh.  i mean, how dare they create a costume that so closely resembles the character? someone correct me if i’m wrong, but isn’t the point of dressing up as a character for halloween to look as much like that character as possible?  and if in fact, that is the point, then wtf is all the fuss about?  the costume is made to look like the character.  which is fictional. that’s it.  end of story. but squeaky wheels apparently get the grease in our culture now, so disney has pulled the costume, which i think is patently ridiculous.  they will no longer sell it.  their statement said: “the team behind ‘moana’ has taken great care to respect the cultures of the pacific islands that inspired the film, and we regret that the maui costume has offended some. we sincerely apologize and are pulling the costume from our website and stores.” translation:  we have no backbone.  or testicles.  or common sense. please add this to the ever-growing list of things that progressives insist on being total killjoys about. way to let the sjw morons win, disney. gawd.      omg disney caved, you guys. they caved.      
__label__1 i’m convinced that the rioters in charlotte are just doing this for attention. they want to be the next viral sensation on social media (even if that’s for beating the crap out of an unarmed white guy trying to get out of a parking garage). that’s why they trek across state lines to be where all the action (and the news coverage) is. and, of course, they have their own cameras in their phones to document their stupidity. there was this “die-in” protest in charlotte last night – presumably to “illustrate” how many black people are supposedly killed by cops (if this were true, would the police have time for anything else? my best guess – probably not). but while the protesters were supposed to play “dead,” they couldn’t help but take selfies of themselves while doing it – die-in outside #cmpd #cltprotest pic.twitter.com/tj4dmhoqzx — ann doss helms (@anndosshelms) september 23, 2016  “we’re supposed to play dead? hang on – gotta post it to twitter!” yeah, that’s justice for keith scott. lemme tell ya… “die-in”…and they can’t put their damned phones down? pfffft. https://t.co/sbrlvwkerx — michelle malkin (@michellemalkin) september 23, 2016  @anndosshelms it’s pretty cool how so many dead people are taking selfies of themselves. — mr writein (@thewriteinparty) september 23, 2016  some “die-in.” the dead don’t text, you stupid millennials. https://t.co/oribkoeulu — dick n. bimbos (@crapplefratz) september 23, 2016  glad to see you morons got your fifteen minutes of fame. because that’s all this stunt is about. it certainly isn’t to help make things any better for black people.      notice anything odd about these ‘die-in’ protests in charlotte?

__label__1 you’ve got to be freaking kidding me. this is just simply unbelievable. not only was the hildabeast’s it guy granted immunity, they gave immunity to cheryl mills and two other staff members. no wonder they couldn’t convict her. the revelations of the immunity granted left republicans in utter shock. then they got furious, but i guess they got out-maneuvered on this one. i told you these people aren’t stupid. there were a myriad of ways that mills herself violated the law or at a minimum assisted clinton in skirting it. in the new york post earlier this month, paul sperry bluntly accused mills of being the evil mastermind behind the clinton email coverup: … mills ultimately made the determinations about which emails should be preserved before she and clinton decided to delete the rest as “personal” … mills was the one who ordered the server host to move the emails from the server to a laptop where she could screen them … and mills may have been a key player in the game of hide-and-seek.  from the federalist papers project: another top aide to hillary rodham clinton was granted immunity by president barack obama’s department of justiceinjustice during the fbi’s investigation into the former secretary of state’s use of a private email server, reported theassociated press. specifically, the fbi provided clinton’s former chief of staff, cheryl mills, and two other staff members with immunity. the bombshell revelation reportedly left congressional republicans in utter shock. “no wonder they couldn’t prosecute a case,” remarked rep. jason chaffetz, chairman of the house oversight and government reform committee. “they were handing out immunity deals like candy.” consider also why the fbi granted immunity — to procure more evidence to use against secretary clinton. yet the department ultimately failed to acquire enough evidence to pursue charges against her, as director james comey tried to explain two months ago:   every official in and out of the fbi involved in this whole investigation should be brought to account for this and should at the very least, lose their jobs, if not go to prison. according to the final house benghazi committee report released three months ago, as reported by politico, mills also tainted “the findings of an internal state department review of the 2012 benghazi terrorist attack.” why in the hell would you grant this woman immunity? oh, i know why! you never had any intention of prosecuting anyone involved. instead the fbi was so corrupt they handed out immunity deals like candy and everyone walked. the fbi is no longer viable. they need to be gutted and rebooted. seriously.       exposed: secret between fbi and cheryl mills has been discovered… [video]      
__label__1 throughout much of the presidential campaign season, the health status of democrat presidential nominee hillary clinton has been a hot topic of discussion, largely owing to her several coughing fits and episodes of bizarre behavior, culminating in her near faint and collapse at the 9/11 memorial service a couple of weeks ago. her health issues were likely a top concern of her campaign headed into the first presidential debate at hofstra university on monday, as the presidential debate commission just released clarifications on debate rules that could conceivably work against clinton. according to the drudge report, an unnamed source within the commission revealed that there would be no breaks during the scheduled 90-minute debate, even if clinton suffers a coughing fit or some other minor medical issue while on stage. “there are no commercial breaks,” the source stated. “period.” furthermore, moderator lester holt of nbc has zero authority to make cameras cut away from the stage or manipulate the audio microphones in any way, meaning clinton will have no place to hide from the eyes of potentially 100 million viewers (and voters) if she does suffer some sort of medical episode during the debate. in related news, the debate commission also shot down a request by clinton’s campaign for a step stool that she could stand on during the debate to help compensate for the immense size difference between her and her republican rival donald trump. clinton is believed to stand approximately 5’4″ tall, nearly a foot shorter than the 6’2″ trump, who will no doubt appear dominating in comparison. however, the commission was willing to provide clinton with a custom-built podium specifically for her that should help to accommodate the obvious size difference between the two candidates. clinton’s campaign may look at loading up their candidate with whatever drugs they are feeding her on a regular basis to prevent another coughing fit or dizzy spell on stage that would likely ruin any chance she still retains of winning the election. please share this on facebook and twitter to spread the word that the presidential debate will have no commercial breaks or stoppages for clinton to hide, rest or recover if she happens to suffer another coughing fit or medical episode on stage. what do you think of the debate commission ruling that there will be no breaks during the debate? scroll down to comment below!      breaking: debate committee issues disastrous ruling against sick hillary      
__label__1 democrat presidential nominee hillary clinton’s camp requested to have the most embarrassing piece of equipment to help her stand tall against donald trump during the debate on monday — a step stool so that she would not be dwarfed by republican rival donald trump’s 6’2″ frame. hillary, standing at only 5’4″, was apparently worried that she would look short and weak standing next to the republican presidential nominee, but the commission for the debate basically said tough luck as the rejected her request. instead, according to the drudge report, they will be making a custom podium that will help accommodate for the differences in height. but wait, there’s more! hillary’s camp also reportedly questioned whether there would be any commercial breaks during the 90-minute showdown. the answer was a resounding no. in fact, debate moderator lester holt does not even have the authority to cut away from the stage during the debate — even if hillary faints or has another coughing spell. it was also noted that microphone audio for both trump and clinton was not to be manipulated, so everything will be out in the open — warts and all. can hillary clinton make it through another speaking engagement, this time actually having to stand up against trump, without having her health interfere? monday’s debate was reportedly expected to draw 100 million viewers, which would make it the biggest political event in history. if team hillary can’t rise to the task, it could spell doom for her campaign. hillary clinton recently had a 4-minute coughing fit at an rally stop in ohio, for example. if something like that happens, or worse — she looses her footing for any reason — that could seriously be the end for her. monday’s debate is sure shaping up to be quite the show. share this story on facebook and twitter and be sure to add your opinion to the comments below. do you think hillary should receive special treatment because of her health? scroll down to comment below!      breaking: hillary demands embarrassing piece of equipment for debate… gets rejected      
__label__1 texas senator ted cruz recognizes that 2016 is not his year. despite giving a valiant effort, his presidential campaign ultimately succumbed to populist appeal and the ever-increasing burden of slander.   because of this, the principled lawmaker ruffled gop feathers when at the rnc convention, he urged people to vote their conscience and noticeably refrained from offering an endorsement of donald trump, the perpetrator of the slander on the campaign trail. for this, cruz was vilified by many who seemingly never stopped and questioned why when cruz urged voting for a true conservative, they assumed he was not speaking about the chosen candidate, trump. after the dust settled, rnc chairman reince priebus stated that those who have not endorsed the republican nominee may find themselves bereft of gop support in the future if they intend to mount another presidential run – a run that is highly likely for cruz. because of this pressure, cruz relented to the power of the gop and offered his endorsement of trump on friday, explaining six policy points guiding his decision in a facebook post. check it out: this election is unlike any other in our nation’s history. like many other voters, i have struggled to determine the right course of action in this general election. in cleveland, i urged voters, “please, don’t stay home in november. stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket whom you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the constitution.” after many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, i have decided that on election day, i will vote for the republican nominee, donald trump. i’ve made this decision for two reasons. first, last year, i promised to support the republican nominee. and i intend to keep my word. second, even though i have had areas of significant disagreement with our nominee, by any measure hillary clinton is wholly unacceptable — that’s why i have always been #neverhillary. six key policy differences inform my decision. first, and most important, the supreme court. for anyone concerned about the bill of rights — free speech, religious liberty, the second amendment — the court hangs in the balance. i have spent my professional career fighting before the court to defend the constitution. we are only one justice away from losing our most basic rights, and the next president will appoint as many as four new justices. we know, without a doubt, that every clinton appointee would be a left-wing ideologue. trump, in contrast, has promised to appoint justices “in the mold of scalia.” for some time, i have been seeking greater specificity on this issue, and today the trump campaign provided that, releasing a very strong list of potential supreme court nominees — including sen. mike lee, who would make an extraordinary justice — and making an explicit commitment to nominate only from that list. this commitment matters, and it provides a serious reason for voters to choose to support trump. second, obamacare. the failed healthcare law is hurting millions of americans. if republicans hold congress, leadership has committed to passing legislation repealing obamacare. clinton, we know beyond a shadow of doubt, would veto that legislation. trump has said he would sign it. third, energy. clinton would continue the obama administration’s war on coal and relentless efforts to crush the oil and gas industry. trump has said he will reduce regulations and allow the blossoming american energy renaissance to create millions of new high-paying jobs. fourth, immigration. clinton would continue and even expand president obama’s lawless executive amnesty. trump has promised that he would revoke those illegal executive orders. fifth, national security. clinton would continue the obama administration’s willful blindness to radical islamic terrorism. she would continue importing middle eastern refugees whom the fbi cannot vet to make sure they are not terrorists. trump has promised to stop the deluge of unvetted refugees. sixth, internet freedom. clinton supports obama’s plan to hand over control of the internet to an international community of stakeholders, including russia, china, and iran. just this week, trump came out strongly against that plan, and in support of free speech online. these are six vital issues where the candidates’ positions present a clear choice for the american people. if clinton wins, we know — with 100% certainty — that she would deliver on her left-wing promises, with devastating results for our country. my conscience tells me i must do whatever i can to stop that. we also have seen, over the past few weeks and months, a trump campaign focusing more and more on freedom — including emphasizing school choice and the power of economic growth to lift african-americans and hispanics to prosperity. finally, after eight years of a lawless obama administration, targeting and persecuting those disfavored by the administration, fidelity to the rule of law has never been more important. the supreme court will be critical in preserving the rule of law. and, if the next administration fails to honor the constitution and bill of rights, then i hope that republicans and democrats will stand united in protecting our fundamental liberties. our country is in crisis. hillary clinton is manifestly unfit to be president, and her policies would harm millions of americans. and donald trump is the only thing standing in her way. a year ago, i pledged to endorse the republican nominee, and i am honoring that commitment. and if you don’t want to see a hillary clinton presidency, i encourage you to vote for him. i’m not sure that i buy that cruz’s endorsement is entirely voluntary, but the fact remains that he’s right. since the time on the campaign trail, trump’s campaign has become more serious and his policy outlines are more articulated. still, it would have been nice if trump had explained his ideas in the primary. instead, what we got was slander and shady smears.       breaking: ted cruz endorses donald trump…      
__label__1 people always think that bad things happen to “other people.” if we’re lucky, we float through life never having to endure harrowing situations of life and death. however, too often, “regular” folks become the target of criminals. citizens are mugged walking down the street; they are awoken by shattering glass as their suburban castle is violated by intruders. while many people throughout the world must suffer at the hands of criminals, americans enjoy the right to bear arms and are afforded the right to defend themselves.   early friday morning, three armed men broke into a home in georgia. a surveillance camera was running and authorities have released the tape to encourage the apprehension of two of the suspects. in the below footage, the trio breaks into a home filled with boxes. the occupant, a woman who reportedly is a restaurant manager who had stacked supplies for the restaurant in the home, can be seen promptly coming out of the bedroom in her pajamas with guns blazing. she began firing on the suspects almost immediately and as bullets ripped through the drywall, the robbers returned fire as they ran for their lives. one man even jumped through a window to escape the barrage of bullets. the georgia woman kept firing and firing and even shot as they ran out the front door. one suspect was found dead on the driveway. after she ran out of ammo, the woman called 911 to report the incident. police reported that the woman acted in accordance with the law in that she acted to defend herself and her property. two of the suspects remain at large, but they did not cover their faces and it is likely that someone may recognize one or both of the criminals. the video is an extraordinary example of the importance of the second amendment. the left hates the fact that americans have the right to defend themselves. evidently, they would rather this article read, “innocent woman slain in her home.”         boom! woman wakes to 3 armed burglars robbing her – guess what she did next? video      
__label__1 i honestly don’t know what happened to the nfl. it was once an organization that promoted the best of sportsmanship. people like vince lombardi, george halas and tom landry all exuded a quiet dignity that permeated the sport.   today, we’re left with endless showboats, back-talk from multi-millionaire primadonnas and now displays of outright contempt for their country. for some reason, the nfl as an organization has allowed these spoiled children to do whatever they want and the sport has greatly suffered as a result. still, those that remember the good ol’ days of gridiron grit aren’t having it. legendary coach mike ditka recently weighed in on the controversy surrounding several ingrates who refuse to stand for the national anthem. directing his comments to colin kaepernick, the beginner of this nauseating trend, ditka had some strong words. when asked in a recent interview what he thought about kaepernick, ditka let loose: “i think it’s a problem, anybody who disrespects this country and the flag. if they don’t like the country, they don’t like our flag, get the hell out. that’s what i think. “so if you’re asking me, i have no respect for colin kaepernick. he probably has no respect for me, that’s his choice. my choice is that i like this country, i respect our flag. and i don’t see all the atrocities going on in this country that people say are going on. “i see opportunities if people want to look for opportunity. now, if they don’t want to look for them, then you can find problems with anything, but this is the land of opportunity because you can be anything you want to be if you work. now, if you don’t work, that’s a different problem.” ditka has also blasted president obama as the “worst president we’ve ever had” and voiced disapproval for the 2014 incident in which some rams players put up a “hands up, don’t shoot” gesture in solidarity with michael brown, a thug who was killed after attacking a police officer. this country as a whole needs to get a lot tougher and needs to reject this breed of radicalism that is tearing our country apart. our nation is not perfect, but i’m with ditka; if america is so damn bad, feel free to play for the canadian league.       legendary coach mike ditka gives kaepernick some advice: “get the hell out!”      
__label__1 a ukraine policewoman is dead after contracting tuberculosis from a suspect that spat in her face. arina koltsova, 35, was arresting a man on new year’s day when the suspect spat in her face, the daily mail reported. she didn’t know the man had tuberculosis at the time. koltsova went untreated for some time until she collapsed at work one day. she was then diagnosed with tuberculosis and started treatment.  “she became ill after new year's day,” her on-duty partner, officer mikhail kindrakevich, told the daily mail. “she had arrested this guy and he spat in her face. some time later she collapsed. she had received treatment. she underwent chemotherapy, she was fed food through an iv drip and she had lost a lot of weight”  koltsova died on july 25. she was buried in kiev two days later. “this is an irreplaceable loss for the whole of kiev police, fond memories of arina will remain in our hearts forever,” koltsova’s police department wrote on its social media page.  “arina wanted to change something for our country,” wrote one of her friends. “joining the police was a conscious choice, she wanted to change things for better.”  according to the national institutes of health, tuberculosis can be treated by taking antibiotics six to 12 months. some cases can be drug-resistant and are not easily treated. it is unclear if koltsova had a drug-resistant form of tuberculosis or if she was not diagnosed quickly enough for effective treatment. it is unclear if the suspect will be charged in koltsova’s death.  sources: daily mail, inquistr, nih / photo credit: arina koltsova via cen      cop dies from tuberculosis after suspect spat at her      
__label__1 an ohio judge ordered an attorney jailed for five days after she refused to remove a black lives matter pin she wore to court. the lawyer is appealing the case.   attorney andrea burton of youngstown, ohio, was charged with contempt of court and given a five-day jail sentence on july 22 after she refused to take off the pin at judge robert milich's request, the new york daily news reported. the judge reportedly called burton, who was representing a client at the time, into his chambers and spoke privately to her about the matter. when the lawyer continued to wear the pin, he adjourned the proceedings and ordered her to be held on a contempt charge. milich told wkbn he made his ruling based on supreme court precedent that allows judges to prohibit political expression in courtrooms.  “there’s a difference between a flag, a pin from your church or the eagles and having a pin that’s on a political issue,” milich said. the judge claimed his decision was not influenced by his own personal views. "a judge doesn't support either side," he told wkbn. "a judge is objective and tries to make sure everyone has an opportunity to have a fair hearing, and it was a situation where it was just in violation of the law." burton has been released pending an appeal on the condition that she refrain from wearing any items that make a political statement in court. if she loses the appeal, she will have to serve five days in jail. the attorney told new york daily news that her constitutional right to free speech superseded supreme court case law and the judge's discretion. “it's an act of civil disobedience, i understand that," burton told ny daily news. "i’m not anti-police, i work with law enforcement and i hold them in the highest regard, and just to say for the record i do believe all lives matter. but at this point they don’t all matter equally, and that’s the problem in the justice system." mike brickner, the senior policy director of the american civil liberties union of ohio, said that judges are generally given a wide latitude in what they allow or don't allow in the courtroom, although their decisions must be reasonable and fairly applied. "there have been cases in the past when people have been given contempt of court for refusing to comply with a judge's order to remove an article of clothing that may have a message on it," brickner wrote in a july 22 email to wkbn. "many times this has been done to retain the defendant’s right to a fair trial."  sources: new york daily news, wkbn / photo credit: wfmj via new york daily news      lawyer jailed for wearing black lives matter pin in court      
__label__1 a pregnant southern california woman was allegedly brutally attacked by someone who responded to a fake "rape fantasy" ad on craigslist created by her husband's ex-girlfriend.  ontario-based michelle suzanne hadley, 29, was apprehended and jailed july 18 on a $1 million bond.  hadley dated a u.s. marshals service agent between 2013 and 2015. prosecutors say hadley placed ads posing as her ex-boyfriend’s new wife to lure men into sexually attacking the woman, who was pregnant with the couple’s first child, reports kcbs. hadley gave the couple’s anaheim address to men who responded to the ad on craigslist, asking them to drop by when she knew the victim would be home alone. numerous men showed up, one of whom assaulted the pregnant woman. fortunately, she managed to call for assistance.  the suspect was previously accused of threatening the same woman and her unborn baby. although the pregnant woman filed a restraining order against hadley on june 6, hadley violated the order by stalking the victim and was arrested june 24, according to the daily mail.  hadley was released on $100,000 bail, but prosecutors say she continued sending threatening emails and responding to the "rape fantasy" ads on craigslist. “hadley is accused of telling the responders that the victim wanted the responders to have forcible sexual intercourse with her, even if she screamed or resisted,” the orange county da said in a statement. “several of the responders showed up at jane doe's residence with the intention of raping the victim but did not succeed.  “one responder arrived at jane doe's residence and physically attacked the victim before she was able to call for help and the man fled the scene.” the jilted lover is charged with stalking, stalking despite a restraining order, assault with the intent to commit a sexual offense during a first-degree burglary, and making criminal threats, plus six counts of attempted forcible rape. hadley’s arraignment is scheduled for august 19. if convicted, she could face seven years to life in prison.      pregnant woman discovers why men kept coming to her home, trying to rape her

__label__1 alicia garza, co-founder of blacklivesmatter, has demanded that there should black communities without any cops. this ignorant statement of hers is turning heads throughout the whole country, but not for the reasons she wants.  in the wake of the latest spate of black men forcing cops to shoot them, one of the founders of the black lives matter movement says it’s time for the police to leave the black community. the idea apparently is that black neighborhoods, full of the worst criminals this country has to offer, would be safer without the protection of the police department. alicia garza co-founded black lives matter on the lie of trayvon martin’s death and it came to national prominence on the lie of michael brown’s death. with a foundation built entirely out of bullshit, it’s no surprise that everything that comes out of the mouth of one of their founding mothers is completely asinine. garza did an interview with complexand it was one for the ages. in regards to the recent police shootings of black men in tulsa, ok and charlotte, nc, garza hasn’t seen the videos, which support the police officers, but somehow she knows the cops were wrong. “i’ve chosen not to[watch the videos]. i think we know what it looks like when somebody is murdered, said garza. yeah, screw the facts. she doesn’t want them getting in the way of her preconceived notions and general hatred of law enforcement. then there is this about the charlotte riots, which erupted after a black cop shot and killed an armed black man: “the thing that people get so concerned about is how do we stop the violence in charlotte, but yet we’re not thinking about the fact that there’s been violence in charlotte since way before whatever is happening there has happened. the brother who was killed is a form of state violence. he was killed and the police will not release the video. the police are not taking accountability for the violence that they enact in our communities and yet there isn’t as much outrage about that as there is about some broken windows and lost property,” she said. a black protester shot and killed another random protester. mobs of blacks have beaten the shit out of innocent white people because of the color of their skin. this is more than broken windows and lost property and it’s based on yet another lie. “how do we stop violence, looting, and riots? the way that we stop that is by making sure that people have the things that they need to thrive. when people are systematically denied their right to adequate housing, adequate schools, to adequate food, to dignity—this is a response and a reaction that we should absolutely expect,” garza said. what a lot of people do to get adequate housing, schools, food, and dignity is work, you know, like at a job where they earn money to buy necessities. it works a lot better than looting for those things or hoping the government will give them to you. and finally garza says the black community would be better off without any police at all: “ultimately, policing in and of itself is problematic. i know that in this country we give a lot of veneration to police. in the ethos of this country, police can do no wrong. and if and when police do wrong, it’s a case of individual bad apples, as opposed to a corroded and corrupt system… quite frankly, many of our [black lives matter] members are continuing to investigate what it would mean to have police-free communities. i think what we’ve continued to see over time is that no moral appeal is actually stopping the deaths of black people, whether they be armed or unarmed,” said garza. interesting theory. she’s saying that cops kill blacks so getting them out of black neighborhoods will mean no blacks will ever be killed. this ignores the fact that almost all black people are killed by other blacks and that by removing cops from the equation there will be even more black killers running loose in the black community. but hey, good luck with that. do these people realize what a cop free community would look like? it’s not all happy and bliss as they think it would be. it would make matters so much worse. i can’t stress this enough; we need police. enchanted sep 26, 2016 at 4:34 pm i will bet ten dollars she wouldn’t live in a cop free zone.      blacklivesmatter co-founder demands cop free black communities…      
__label__1 kathleen willey, one well known former mistress of bill clinton, among an estimated 2,000 women over the course of his political career, was asked if she would attend monday’s presidential debate if invited by trump. her response? “i would refrain for now. let her do herself in on her own.” she continued, explaining that if every woman bill clinton had an affair with over the years was present at the debates, it would fill the hall. see her comment below: “most of us are well known and our stories have been repeated several times over the years, but what concerns me the most are the voices of my sisters who are still afraid to come out of the darkness. i have communicated with a number of them and they are still terrified of publicly sharing their experiences with the clintons. the real story here is not one of our presence in the front row at any of these debates, but the unhindered lust for power that the clintons have displayed for decades. hillary clinton has lied, cheated and stolen our lives from us. people have died in her wake of deceit. we could fill the entire audience. i would like to see the day when these women can step into the light and share their stories of brutality, terror and intimidation without the kind of fear of intimidation and recrimination that we have experienced for far too many years.” the clinton machine has spent years terrorizing bill’s mistresses. and much of that was orchestrated by hillary, who, for all intents and purposes is the attack dog that keeps her husband from having to answer for his sleazy lifestyle.   hillary would be a shameful president and an exceedingly poor example to our daughters. she models the “break the rules to get ahead” mentality. just being a woman does not make her a good role model. american women and girls deserve better. they deserve a woman president who is honest. and hillary certainly isn’t. no matter who sits in the front row at the debate, hillary will still be there; lying, fabricating, screeching and coughing…and that’s just the introductions. trump will wipe the floor with wicked hillary. and all those women victimized by bill and hillary over the years will be laughing hysterically. what goes around, comes around. and you, mrs. bill clinton, are overdue for some karma. never hillary.         boom! kathleen willey says clinton’s victims could fill entire audience at debate [video]

__label__1 cnn had an ominous headline today (it’s showing on google but they changed it on the story): trump, netanyahu meet for nearly 90 minutes. it’s like a big deal to cnn that netanyaho met with trump longer than clinton saying that ‘her meeting with the prime minister was somewhat shorter than his talk sunday morning with trump. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu met hillary clinton sunday night at a new york hotel, after conferring earlier in the day with donald trump for nearly 90 minutes at trump tower’.   so why do you think netanyahu met longer with trump than hillary? well hillary has been the secretary of state during an unprecedented time where the united state’s devotion to israel has waned dramatically. under hillary as secretary of state, the u.s. has given over $100 billion to the terrorist regime in iran whom obama supports over israel. this is what leaders look like.  the meetings between netanyahu and trump and hillary materialized over 24 hours on friday. trump’s aid made a phone call to one of the prime minister’s advisers. once it was clear that a meeting was going to happen, netanyahu’s office contacted clinton’s campaign to hold a meeting with her as well, to keep the balance. the prime minister’s senior official explained that, “the prime minister’s instruction was clear – if we meet with one side, we must also meet with the other side. we are following the number of meetings to make sure that one side doesn’t get more meetings than the other.” the trump campaign statement said during the meeting, “trump agreed that the military assistance provided to israel and missile defense cooperation with israel are an excellent investment for america,” amid the backdrop of speculation that trump would support cutting u.s. military aid to israel. trump told netanyahu that if elected, “there will be extraordinary strategic, technological, military and intelligence cooperation between the two countries.” trump added that israel is a “vital partner of the united states in the global war against radical islamic terrorism.” the two also discussed the nuclear deal with iran and the fight against isis. “mr. trump acknowledged that jerusalem has been the eternal capital of the jewish people for over 3000 years, and that the united states, under a trump administration, will finally accept the long-standing congressional mandate to recognize jerusalem as the undivided capital of the state of israel,” the statement read. “mr. trump recognized that israel and its citizens have suffered far too long on the front lines of islamic terrorism,” according to the statement. “he agreed with prime minister netanyahu that the israeli people want a just and lasting peace with their neighbors, but that peace will only come when the palestinians renounce hatred and violence and accept israel as a jewish state.” does hillary have anything to worry about since she has hardly been able to retain a stable relationship between the us and israel and now trump is asking for private audiences reaffirming traditional promises the us has had with israel since before the obama presidency? when it comes to looking presidential, trump is really kicking hillary’s butt.    readout of donald j. trump's meeting w/ israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu#trumppence16 #standwithisraelhttps://t.co/rfnfs4hbot pic.twitter.com/u9dg05sufi — linda suhler, ph.d.

__label__1 a couple months ago, discover the networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by soros. they have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, muslim migration and social justice. so, why then is soros caught again?   now a new organization is going after trump and sure enough, they’re funded by soros too! it’s called ‘common defense pac’ and their mantra is: “as veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every american. we continue to fulfill this promise by standing against donald trump.” then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. on their social media you see the same stuff. they feature videos and materials from other pacs that are also funded by george soros. common defense pac shared one of its own anti-trump video ads, which has a common defense pac logo on it at the end, right underneath a url link to a moveon.org petition called “senator portman: disavow donald trump.” the pac routinely promotes the twitter hashtag #vetsagainsttrump, which is also promoted routinely by moveon.org. moveon.org’s political action arm has also put out advertising for the #vetsagainsttrump hashtag. the common defense pac logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a thunderclap campaign called #standwithvets: #dumptrump.” the campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor mark ruffalo and leftist pundit van jones. moveon.org was listed as the organizer of the thunderclap campaign. moveon.org and common defense pac worked together on a live protest to pressure john mccain to “un-endorse donald j. trump.” thinkprogress reported on august 4th that veterans “came to the capitol to deliver mccain a petition, organized by progressive group moveon.org in conjunction with veterans group common defense pac, calling for him to revoke his support for the republican presidential nominee.” common sense pac’s july quarterly filing report with the fec lists only one donor: a baltimore it consultant named marjorie roswell who gave $20,000 on june 30th. and then the group’s director, perry o’brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. his ‘iraq veterans against the war’ bio describes him: perry o’brien served as a medic in afghanistan with the 82nd airborne division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. for several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. he has been an active member of iraq veterans against the war, and was a key organizer of winter soldier: iraq and afghanistan. the pac that’s suppose to be veterans against trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. you can hardly call that a veteran, right? o’brien personally started a moveon.org petition called “tell gop leaders to disavow trump and his attacks on veterans.” the petition is probably what grabbed soros attention to get o’brien to start the shallow pac. with all of these shell groups being created solely to destroy trump and funded by soros, do you think that trump stands a chance against the left?       exposed: soros funding fake veterans’ pac to take trump down      
__label__1 you’d think that putting together a list of the 7 worst mass murderers in american history would be a straightforward task. unfortunately, it’s not, because there are quite a few “mass murders” that most americans don’t consider to fit the definition. for example, most people wouldn’t look at  the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the tulsa race riot, or 80 branch davidians dying when bill clinton’s department of justice moved in on them to be “mass murders.” so, as a definition, we’re talking about large killings on american soil, perpetrated by a single person or small group of people. what follows are the 7 worst mass murderers in american history.     location: newtown, connecticut nickname: sandy hook massacre year: 2012 method: semi-automatic rifle, semi-automatic pistol deaths: 27 adam lanza had asperger's syndrome and was anorexic and mentally ill; he became increasingly isolated and dysfunctional. on lanza’s 20th birthday, he shot his mother four times in the head with one of her guns while she slept. then he drove her car to the sandy hook elementary school where he killed 20 children between the ages of 5 and 10, along with 6 adults. after he finished his murderous rampage, lanza shot himself in the head and died on the scene.     location: blacksburg, virginia  nickname: virginia tech massacre year: 2007 method: two semi-automatic pistols deaths: 32 cho was born in south korea, but was a legal resident of the united states. he had depression and anxiety problems and seemed to have extreme difficulty talking with people. like adam lanza, some of his teachers were alarmed at the violent stories he wrote. in fact one of them, lucinda roy, said she was concerned for her safety when she met with him one on one and said she reported him to school authorities. unfortunately, nothing was done. cho spent months planning the attack, but it began in a bizarre fashion. cho murdered emily jane hilscher in her dorm room along with ryan clark who apparently tried to help her. there has been some speculation that cho had a crush on her, but there doesn’t seem to be definitive proof of that. after killing both of them, cho managed to escape back to his dorm room without being detected. there he mailed an angry, rambling manifesto to nbc. two and a half hours after the first killings, cho went to another building on campus and killed an additional 25 students and 5 teachers. afterwards, cho committed suicide by shooting himself in the head.     location: new york, new york nickname: wall street bombing year: 1920 method: dynamite (bomb) deaths: 38 in 1920, a horse drawn carriage filled with 100 pounds of dynamite and 500 pounds of iron was parked outside the j.p. morgan bank in new york city. the bomb killed 38 people and wounded another 143. there was speculation that communists or anarchists were behind the bombing, but unfortunately, the perpetrator was never caught.     location: rancho santa fe, california nickname: heaven’s gate suicide year: 1997 method: persuasion/suffocation deaths: 38 marshall applewhite was the gay leader of the heaven’s gate cult. applewhite, who had such a hold over his followers that he convinced six of them to join him in being castrated, told the cult members that they had to kill themselves in order to hitch a ride on a ufo hiding behind the hale-bopp comet. over a three day long period, the cult members, including marshall applewhite, took phenobarbital and vodka, then put plastic bags over their heads and suffocated to death.     location: bath township, michigan nickname: bath school disaster year: 1927 method: dynamite/pyrotol (bomb) deaths: 44 kehoe was the elected treasurer of the bath consolidated school board and was temporarily appointed as the bath township clerk. after losing an election for the position, kehoe, who was also deep in debt, stopped maintaining his farm. soon thereafter, his farm went into foreclosure. adding to the pressure on kehoe, his wife was ill with tuberculosis. yet and still, kehoe didn’t simply “snap.” he used his position as the school’s volunteer handyman to his advantage. it allowed him to spend months planting explosives near the bath school. kehoe started by murdering his own wife and then set his farm on fire. from there, kehoe went to the school and set off the explosives he’d planted. thirty seven children, most of whom were between the ages of 6 and 8, died in the explosions. however, kehoe wasn’t done yet. after rescue efforts began, kehoe drove up to a group including the school superintendent and detonated his truck, which was filled with dynamite. kehoe and 6 victims died in the blast. when his farm was searched afterward, a sign with the words “criminals are made, not born” was found.     location: orlando, florida nickname: orlando nightclub shooting year: 2016 method: semi-automatic rifle, semi-automatic pistol deaths: 49 omar mateen was a radical muslim whose father supported the taliban. mateen’s wife knew the attacks were coming and even helped him scope out the pulse nightclub. former classmates remembered mateen cheering the 9/11 attacks. there was rampant speculation that mateen was actually gay and taking revenge for being rejected by men in the club, but fbi sources have commented that they’ve found no evidence that mateen was “secretly gay.” at 2:00 a.m., mateen walked into the gay pulse nightclub in orlando and started shooting. by the time he was done, 49 people were dead. during his rampage, mateen called 911 and news 13 of orlando in order to let people know he was pledging allegiance to isis. after the police arrived, mateen took hostages. eventually, swat stormed the building and mateen was shot 8 times and killed.     location: oklahoma city nickname: oklahoma city bombing year: 1995 method: ammonium nitrate (bomb) deaths: 168 on april 19, 1995, which was the 2nd anniversary of the end of the branch davidian siege, a truck bomb was parked under the day care center in the alfred p. murrah federal building. it contained more than 4000 pounds of ammonium nitrate and the explosion was enormous with 324 nearby buildings damaged or destroyed while 168 people died and 680 were injured. within an hour and a half of the bombing, timothy mcveigh, the man who had driven the truck, was picked up on a traffic stop and quickly linked to the bombing. after searching the house of mcveigh’s father, evidence led the fbi to his co-conspirator, terry nichols. nichols turned himself in. at the trial, it was revealed that lori fortier knew about the bombing, but did nothing to warn anyone. her husband michael actually helped scout the location. timothy mcveigh was a militia member who was angry about government abuses in waco and at ruby ridge and took his revenge with the bombing. in may of 2001, mcveigh was put to death by lethal injection. nichols is still serving 161 life sentences. michael fortier, who testified against mcveigh and nichols in return for leniency for his wife and a reduced sentence, served 10 1/2 years while his wife was given immunity.        the 7 worst mass murderers in american

__label__1 tragedy has left the miami marlins team in devastation. their friend, colleague and someone they probably considered family, has died in a tragic accident. such unexpected shocking loss is not an experience to wish on anyone.  jose fernandez, their pitcher, was killed in a boating accident sunday morning. it was just last week he had posted a picture on social media of his girlfriend who had an obvious ‘baby bump’ in an announcement that they were expecting their first child. in its caption, he told the world he thanked his girlfriend for coming into his life and expressed his excitement for their future together as a family. a news conference was held by his team after learning of his death and the team’s manager, don mattingly, was very visibly shaken during the conference, in tears over the loss of his team player and friend. “i see such a little boy,” mattingly said. “the way he played, there was just joy with him when he played.” when the news conference was over, left fielder, christian yellich and the team’s second baseman, dee gordon, embraced and walked out somberly with other team members. a loss like this, so unexpected… was visibly painful watching them trying to get a grip on the situation. earlier, gordon had walked out to the mound at marlins park, where the grounds crew had painted a “16” — fernandez’s number — and placed a marlins cap. gordon stood looking at the tribute before kneeling down in a moment of silent reflection. “sadly, the brightest lights are often the ones that extinguish the fastest,” marlins owner jeffrey loria said in a statement.  we are stunned and devastated by the tragic news that jose fernandez, 24, has died in a boating accident. https://t.co/qibcniyj1i pic.twitter.com/sdzol6nmeb — mlb (@mlb) september 25, 2016    i will miss you… sorry if i never told you how valuable your friendship was too me… pic.twitter.com/hzstrzdbri — tom koehler (@tkrefresh22) september 25, 2016    you loved striking me out, and teasing me about it. i'm going to miss you bro #puiglovesyou pic.twitter.com/o3tqohrv5u — yasiel puig (@yasielpuig) september 25, 2016   losing someone close to you is one of the hardest trials of life. he leaves behind an unborn baby, that will never get to meet him in the flesh, and that is heartbreaking in and of itself. sending prayers of comfort to all those who are suffering from this loss. may he rest in peace.       tragedy strikes: marlins pitcher jose fernandez and two others killed in horrific crash      
__label__1 yet another black female sailor declared that she would sit during the national anthem. janaye ervin posted on facebook her intentions and declared the navy was punishing her for exercising her constitutional rights. the military is a realm unto its own. it is governed by military law and procedure. this woman has served in the navy for eight years… she damn well knows that and is using a marxist/terrorist tactic… she’s using our own freedoms against us. ervin is in violation of navy regulations. they require all uniformed personnel to stand at attention and face the ensign while the anthem is played. you do not get an exception because you are black. as john bloomer pointed out, anyone has a right to protest, but action conducted as a protest does not grant immunity from the law or a pass on any social consequence. the discipline within the naval ranks is warranted on her actions or lack thereof.  from the independent review journal: the national anthem protests — inspired by 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick — were just gathering steam when the first american military member raised eyebrows by joining in. facebook community, us army military police wtf moments, posted video of the sailor, who said that she would not stand for the anthem “until the u.s. proves that they’ve got my back as a black woman”:   although the navy did speak to the sailor in the video, officials made it clear that she would not be separated from the service for her actions. last week, as tensions increased following two highly publicized police shootings, another sailor came forward to say that she would be sitting out the national anthem as well:  ervin also said that she intended to “support and defend the constitution of the united states and to spread freedom and democracy around the world.” but she would do well to heed the observation of fellow african american martin baker who was reminded of something he was told in training: “i was told in basic training the simplest of phrases: we are here to preserve and defend democracy, not practice it. when you put the uniform on, you must put aside your personal feelings and remember at that moment you are a direct representative of the united states of america. you are, if need be, the advanced diplomacy of the american way of life. if at any time you feel you cannot stand and represent our flag and our nation even in something as simple as the anthem, you forfeit the right to wear that uniform.” that is exactly right and it goes right to the heart of her transgression. ervin’s actions could also be considered ‘political speech’, which is also against military regulations. because of these two incidents, the navy has issued new guidelines: according to navy regulation 1205, personnel in uniform must stand at attention and face the flag when the national anthem is played. navy active-duty personnel in civilian clothes will face the flag, stand at attention, and place their right hand over their heart. additionally, sailors will receive training on the appropriate usage of social media, and must not use it to discredit the naval service, and should be reminded it could potentially be used as evidence against them. while military personnel are not excluded from the protections granted by the first amendment, the us supreme court has stated that the different character of our community and of the military mission requires a different application of those protections.” neither of the sailors has been discharged… yet. but the new guidelines state that such actions will be punishable under article 92 of the ucmj and will be considered serious offenses — grounds for involuntary separation from the service. as they should. don’t enlist if you can’t follow the military’s rules, regulations and laws. and if you can’t bring yourself to stand for the national anthem, perhaps you should also find a different country where you have no issues with patriotism.       navy sailor proudly sits during national anthem in uniform – navy veterans set her straight!

__label__1 cbs exposing obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. but it got little media attention then and he’s still doing it. he’s diverting hundreds of millions of us dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. tell me again how he is not a muslim. this just screams it. and people wonder why he grovels before the mullahs of iran… why he gives isis a pass… why he is terraforming the us into a muslim nation. set aside for a moment that we are broke, due to marxist policies implemented ever since reagan left office… it’s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. by all accounts, we are funding islamic terrorists right and left. we are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques… we are funding their wars as well, even against america.  from truthfeed: “you didn’t build that”…oh wait, you did! a cbs news investigation found that the obama state department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with u.s. foreign aid. the united states ‘investment’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘good-will effort’ in muslim countries has upset many.   “we are spending money we don’t have. this is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said jared thomas, a taxpayer advocate. millions more dollars have been sent to places like cyprus. the state department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with u.s. tax dollars. many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. fully one third of americans are now out of work. we can’t make ends meet and our country can’t pay its bills… yet somehow, obama can send well over $770 million to islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. it makes your eyes bleed. the state department declined a cbs atlanta news request for an interview. anchor justin farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know. the state department did send cbs atlanta news an email saying that they are: “fighting islamic extremism by building relationships with islamic leaders.” what bovine excrement. let me spell it out. our so-called wealth is being redistributed to islamists and their countries. our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the us. and while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic. this is a coup from without and from within… the enemy is now among us.       outrage! obama spends $770m dollars in tax payer money to renovate mosques over seas… [video]      
__label__1 there have been so many deaths in country music over the past couple of months, and we thought that we were going to have to say goodbye to another legend saturday night. it was a normal saturday night at the cornstock concert on the hill in garnett, kansas until eddie montgomery collapsed on stage in the middle of his performance. many of you probably know the country star from the country duo montgomery gentry.  montgomery gentry was founded in 1999 when eddie montgomery and troy gentry came together and graced us all with their talents. the country duo has released 6 studio albums since their big debut and has had several no. 1 hits such as “if you ever stop loving me”, “something to be proud of”, “lucky man”, “back when i knew it all” and “roll with me”. the duo rose to fame shortly after the start of their career and they have continued to be a country favorite over the years. the duo was performing at their concert saturday (september 24th) when eddie montgomery collapsed on the stage.  the medics immediately rushed to the stage and it was just moments later that he was walking off. the concert continued as troy gentry lead the band out. it was just four songs later that eddie walked back out on the stage and apparently told the audience that he was not feeling well all day and that he was very dehydrated. and just like anything else, rumors started. fans all over were saying that eddie had a heart attack right there on stage. apparently, they weren’t listening or they didn’t believe that he was actually dehydrated. the next morning on the duo’s twitter they announced that eddie was doing well and that it was definitely not a heart attack. there are false reports floating around that eddie had a heart attack last night. not true. he was dehydrated and returned to the stage. — montgomery gentry (@mgunderground) september 25, 2016  eddie wanted to reassure everyone that he was indeed alive and that he didn’t have a heart attack, so a couple of hours after the initial post he took it upon himself to post a photo of him and his wife. not only that, but he made sure that all of his fans knew that he was drinking plenty of water – doing his best to prevent the same thing from happening again. eddie and jennifer send their regards from key west and thanks for all of the prayers and well wishes. and he's drinking plenty of h20! pic.twitter.com/xcjltzcihx — montgomery gentry (@mgunderground) september 25, 2016  we are so glad that eddie is feeling better! i can’t imagine how scary this was for him and his fans!  we are praying for you eddie!      breaking: legendary country star collapses on stage during performance, please pray for eddie      
__label__1 we are absolutely heartbroken to hear about the death of someone that was so special to everyone in country music. she always had a smile on her face and she lit up any room that she walked into. jean shepard was 82 years old and after only a couple of days in hospice care we had to say our goodbyes. jean shepard was a grand ole opry member and she wasn’t just any member. shepard was known as the “grand lady”. in 1955 she was inducted and in 2015 she was the only female that had ever been a member of the opry for 60 years – which is how she earned the name.  the grand lady was also inducted into the country music hall of fame a couple of years ago in 2011. she was passionate about country music, and loved what it stood for. of course, like many older stars she felt like country music just isn’t the same as what it used to be. in one of her final interviews with women of country at the grand ole opry she told all. “sixty years ago, i loved what the grand ole opry stood for,…i still love what it stands for, but not quite so much. isn’t it terrible being so truthful?”  the grand lady passed away from complications due to parkinson’s disease on september 25, 2016. jean’s publicist shared about her life in a press release and we are heartbroken. “jean was born ollie imogene shepard in oklahoma and raised one of ten children in visalia, california. at age 14 she was spotted by country star hank thompson singing and playing bass in the all-girl band she’d formed called the melody ranch girls. thompson brought her to the attention of capitol records and soon the trailblazing shepard was setting the precedent in country music for a young woman recording and touring on her own rather than as a member of a family act, a duo, or a band’s ‘girl singer.'” there is truly no one like jean, and there never will be another grand lady. she was survived by her husband and her 3 sons. please continue to pray for this family during their time of loss.  rip jean shepard      america just tragically lost a country music icon, please pray for jean shepard’s family      
__label__1 there’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. it’s because isis, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. with isis and other islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to islam and live their lives subservient to their muslim rulers. anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. isis even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.   while the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. they welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces. a series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that marines are ready for them. and it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the united states marine corps:   considering how many terrorist attacks the united states has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the marine corps to send this message to the terrorists. liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent americans from being able to defend themselves. who cares what they think? and this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. remember, what they want is to make people afraid. these billboards show that not only are the marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. if we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.   sorry, isis. game over. share this on facebook if you agree with this badass statement!       boom! marines send terrorists scathing message [video]      
__label__1 the rioting in charlotte has practically crippled the city. businesses were looted, windows were smashed. so-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. north carolina governor pat mccrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the national guard to get the situation under control. and now, government officials have had enough too. they just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.   officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. but it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. the parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. they could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children. “parents are responsible for their children. if they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official wilson stewart said during a press conference. “many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. we urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”   will this keep protesters from turning violent? will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents. let’s be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there’s a good chance you’re not doing a good job at parenting. officials have also put a curfew into place as they work to restore peace and order in charlotte.         boom! charlotte officials finally silence rioters with one e p i c announcement!

__label__1 i love texas! i mean i really love their attitude. they are like the honey badger, they just don’t give a damn about what everyone else thinks. governor abbott is the quintessential texan because he stands up and defends the citizens of his state even if it means spitting in the face of barack obama.   governor abbott told obama on wednesday that texas would no longer participate in his current refugee program because of the massive security concerns. abbott has a right to be concerned since we had 4+ terrorist attacks over the weekend in the united states. abbott doesn’t want to take chances that the hardly screened refugees settling in his state would have terroristic ideals. the texas state refugee coordinator gave their 120 days notice of their intention to withdraw. the office of refugee resettlement said in a statement its services to help integrate newcomers into u.s. society are only provided after they complete stringent us security screenings. currently the us refugee settlement processing protocol is riddled with security holes and has already let dozens of extremist refugees into the us. “the federal government’s refugee settlement program is riddled with serious problems that pose a threat to our nation,” the governor said in a statement. “the director of the federal bureau of investigation and the director of national intelligence have repeatedly declared their inability to fully screen refugees from terrorist-based nations. even with the inability to properly vet refugees from syria and countries known to be supporters or propagators of terrorism, president obama is now ineptly proposing a dramatic increase in the number of refugees to be resettled in the u.s.” “while many refugees pose no danger, some pose grave danger, like the iraqi refugee with ties to isis who was arrested earlier this year after he plotted to set off bombs at two malls in houston,” abbott said. “despite multiple requests by the state of texas, the federal government lacks the capability or the will to distinguish the dangerous from the harmless, and texas will not be an accomplice to such dereliction of duty to the american people,” he added. “therefore, texas will withdraw from the refugee resettlement program. i strongly urge the federal government to completely overhaul a broken and flawed refugee program that increasingly risks american lives.” so take that mr. president!         what texas just did will make you proud! – obama has 120 days to comply…      
__label__1 it’s not game over yet hillary! congress is out to find the truth and in a letter on sept 9, asked for comey to release all information he had regarding hillary’s email scandal that fbi went over as evidence. he did not comply. so now…congress has subpoenaed him! the washington examiner reported: house committee on science, space and technology chairman lamar smith, r-texas, subpoenaed fbi director james comey on tuesday for documents and information related to the security of the private email account and server hillary clinton used when she led the state department. smith asked comey for the documents in a sept. 9 letter, but then issued the subpoena after comey failed to comply with the request. “the committee continues to have questions about the structure and security of the email system used by former secretary clinton and whether she and her staff employed cybersecurity standards required by fisma,” the statement from the committee read. rep. smith earlier requested more information about hillary clinton’s server activities, such as the interviews with the platte river employees involved in setting up and maintaining the private server. recently, platte river networks employee paul combetta, who reportedly used bleachbit to “wipe” hillary’s server, plead the fifth before congress. the obfuscation from the u.s. government over the private email server of hillary clinton, whose communication practices while at the state department undoubtedly put the nation’s security at risk, is an alarming thing. the executive branch is ideally meant to be aloof from election matters; but as we have seen with the irs, epa and other government agencies stocked with card-carrying democrats, “everything is politics.” does this mean that a clinton indictment is still a possibility so close to election? anything could happen. the ramifications of an indictment so close to election day would be huge for their party- with quite a blow back. they should have just told the truth a lot earlier…to save themselves the embarrassment, and the trouble. the irony of it being, many democrats would have gladly traded in hillary for bernie or biden. only time will tell what’s going to happen. here’s hoping that hillary’s skeletons will bury her career all on their own. me sep 21, 2016 at 1:25 pm hahahaha, we can only pray that something good will come out of this for america’s sake!!!!!!!!!!!!!trump 2016!!!!!!      breaking: fbi director, james comey- subpoenaed by congress…      
__label__1 progressive liberals are only interested in “protecting children” when they get to define protection, which, apparently doesn’t involve using firearms, but it does include dismembering them for the mother’s convenience. since their definition of protection is kind of wonky, one school has decided to take the safety and well-being of your child into their hands and libs are going bonkers.  to nobody’s surprise, this school is in texas. some of the parents are perfectly okay with the sign and knowing the people who are supposed to protect their students can actually do so, if someone comes into the building with intent to harm. “schools have been a target for, for lack of a better word, crazy people, and i’m perfectly fine with it,” said jillian sides, who has two sons, one in 7th grade and one in kindergarten, at the school. the school also plans to place additional signs at all entrances to the school, so everyone entering the school knows that the teachers are packing heat. let’s set up a scenario for the people who might be against teachers having guns. let’s say you are dead broke and are at risk of losing your home. you decide, in a moment of desperation, that the only way to gather the money to pay off your debts is to commit robbery. so, you sit down and have a think. do you rob a bank? do you rob a convenience store? do you rob your neighbor up the street? how do you make this decision? well, banks have pretty serious security. cameras, sometimes armed guards and buttons that alert the police to any incident taking place. the local 7/11? they installed security cameras the other day after another robbery and you know from talking to one of the clerks that they now have a shotgun under the counter. what about the neighbor who has a “proudly anti-gun” sign in their yard? chances are that the security at that house is very low. so, any person thinking of committing a crime would be led to believe that hitting the building with the least amount of security would be the safest bet. sorry, mr. jones, that means you. criminals and crazy people know that schools are hugely gun-free zones, so they can cause the most amount of harm and chaos without fear of physical retaliation. they don’t want to be confronted by a courageous individual with the ability to stop them, so they go to places where the odds of running into one of those is very low. this school has officially made it known that they are dangerous to criminals, which will deter them and cause them to move on to the next target. god bless them for that and thank you for protecting america’s children.       libs mad! school warns they will do everything necessary to protect students – teachers armed…      
__label__1 there is a large portion of the american population that does not believe that the black lives matter movement is actually concerned about the preservation of black lives, rather, they are just looking for a reason to cause chaos and violence. matt walsh from theblaze isn’t mincing words when he refers to the group as “terrorists.” he gives reasons as to why he believe that with every iota of his being. if you support the message, but not the way blm is going about spreading it, this may very well be the most important op-ed you read all day.  he starts out with a breakdown of the kerfuffle taking place in north carolina. if you’re a little confused about what’s going on in charlotte, north carolina, allow me to explain: a black cop shot and killed an armed black man, so a bunch of black rioters decided to burn down a black neighborhood and loot black-owned businesses in order to protest racism against black people. make sense now? perhaps that is an over-simplification, but he’s absolutely correct. he continues: no, i suppose it doesn’t. there are many questions that immediately come to mind. questions like: why are they claiming keith scott was unarmed when all of the evidence clearly shows he had a gun? and no matter if the shooting was justified or not, why are they shouting “white cops are devils” when the cop who shot scott was black? and even if the cop was white and even if all white cops are devils (which seems unlikely, theologically speaking), why are they destroying their own community in response? and perhaps the biggest and most confounding question of all: why are we still calling this sort of brutal violence, mayhem and criminality a “protest”? at this point, it seems like too strange a coincidence that literally every single black lives matter “protest” involves chaos and bloodshed. i almost said it “descends into” chaos and bloodshed, but that wouldn’t be quite accurate. after witnessing this play out in cities across the country for the past couple of years, i think we can now officially declare that chaos and bloodshed are the point, not just unfortunate byproducts; not the result of an otherwise peaceful demonstration “devolving” into something decidedly less peaceful. the media keeps saying — as it has reported about every blm riot before it — that charlotte “started as a peaceful protest” and then became violent. but that’s like claiming a drive-by shooting “started as a peaceful jaunt through the city” until the passengers starting firing indiscriminately out of the driver’s side window. that may be true, in a certain sense, but the drive was always leading inevitably and purposefully to the shooting part, just as these “protests” are, from the beginning, merely a staging ground for savagery, looting and destruction. the riots are not aberrations. they are not surprising and unexpected developments in the midst of otherwise peaceful demonstrations. they are planned, coordinated and widespread. and they seem to only be getting worse with each successive incident. read the rest of his opinion piece here. it is absolutely worth your time.       blacklivesmatter is not a group of protesters – they are terrorists, here’s why…

__label__1 it almost pains me to say it, but israel probably has the only leader in the world in possession of an actual spine. don’t get me wrong – benjamin netanyahu is one of my all-time favorite world leaders. i only wish that we had someone to match his strength, conviction, morality, and spirit. instead, we have president mom jeans. today, bibi spoke at the united nations general assembly, which can’t be an easy thing for him to do. after all, an organization that puts representatives of nations who think israel doesn’t deserve to exist in positions of authority isn’t going to look too kindly on the israeli prime minister. but now that i think about it – if you’re speaking to a group of people who pretty much hate you and your citizens, you are pretty well free to speak your mind plainly. which is exactly what bibi did today. here’s a clip of his speech – here’s more of his speech – focusing on innovation, intelligence and water technology, netanyahu said that despite the un “deserving every word” of his previous criticism of the body, he was positive that israeli expertise in these areas mean it has a “bright future” in diplomacy. shortly after telling the assembled diplomats that they would soon change their voting patterns on israel at the world body, netanyahu openly called arab states “allies for security, prosperity and peace.” “for the first time in my lifetime many other states in the region recognize that israel is not their enemy, they recognize that israel is their ally,” he stated. “our common enemies are iran and isis, our common goals are prosperity and peace.” “i hope that in the future we will work together openly,” he added, truly taking the growing regional cooperation out of the closet. in his address, just one day after meeting with us president barack obama on the sidelines of the general assembly, netanyahu also focused on the “unbreakable bond” between the two nations. “our unbreakable bond with the us transcends parties and politics,” he said. “it reflects, above all else, the overwhelming support of israel among the american people, which is at record highs, and for which we are grateful.” the truth is that women and minorities in israel are the most free in the middle east, which totally freaks out places like saudi arabia and syria. they just use the un to punish israel for giving its citizens freedom and liberty, instead of forcing them to live under tyrannical religious extremist rule. but just for fun – compare what women in israel can do and have done (what pm netanyahu talked about in his speech), to what women in saudi arabia have to endure. yeah, no contest. if, for some reason, i was forced to leave america and i had to choose to live in either israel or some other middle eastern glorified sandbox, i would go to israel, no question.      israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu: the un has become a moral farce      
__label__1 what do you do if you’re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you’re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group? step one should obviously be to lock your doors to make it just a little bit harder for them to break in. step two is up to you. do you put the pedal to the floor and power through? do you call the police and wait. this guy had another idea entirely and it worked like a charm.  a random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in north carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. the photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through. that seems very bizarre considering that we’ve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. that being the case, why would they just let one guy go? well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone. while being white in the middle of an angry blm mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. when his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun. the group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination. this is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations. do you think that he did the right thing? or should he just have driven through?       white guy walled in car by blacklivesmatter protesters – they see what he’s brandishing and scatter…      
__label__1 an officer-involved shooting that took place over the weekend in tulsa, oklahoma, has drawn heavy criticism from the usual suspects in the black lives matter movement and their allies in the liberal media. video of the incident filmed from a helicopter overhead appeared to some to show a 40-year-old unarmed black man named terence crutcher with his hands over his head being shot and killed by white police officer betty shelby, seemingly confirming the narrative that police routinely use excessive force and deadly violence against black men who pose no threat to them. but according to tulsa world, evidence was discovered in crutcher’s vehicle that, while unknown to the officers on the scene at the time, could nevertheless explain some of the man’s behavior that led to the officer feeling compelled to fire her weapon. inside the vehicle beside which crutcher was shot and killed was discovered a vial of pcp, a highly dangerous drug that can often create a psychopathic and violent state of mind in its users. in fact, there were numerous anecdotal accounts of individuals on pcp who become nearly impervious to pain, including gunshots, continuing to attack police officers and innocent bystanders alike even as they are being shot repeatedly in locations that would instantly drop an ordinary non-drug using suspect. another matter that could very well help explain crutcher’s attitude and actions during the incident was that he had a lengthy criminal rap sheet, including several counts of resisting arrest and prior drug convictions for which he had served time. it is also noteworthy that crutcher had a warrant out for his arrest related to previous charges of resisting arrest and drug use, so he could have made clear through his words and attitude that he had no intention of peacefully being arrested or returning to prison. all of this is evidence that could conceivably corroborate the view of the officer on the scene who reportedly stated crutcher looked “like a bad dude” who “could be on something.” it was expected that the medical examiner’s office will release a toxicology report detailing whether crutcher had the powerful drug in his system at the time of the incident, along with the rest of the broader autopsy report. please share this on facebook and twitter to help spread the word that pcp was found in terence crutcher’s vehicle, which may explain why his actions prompted a tulsa police officer to shoot him. do you think the presence of pcp in this man's car changes anything? scroll down to comment below!      breaking: police find something a lot scarier than a gun in terence crutcher’s car      
__label__1 ambassador chris stevens’ former fiancée, lydie denier, said that former secretary of state hillary clinton resigned because she knew just how badly she had bungled the benghazi debacle. “she was at the top at the time; she was the secretary of state,” denier told newsmax. “what i always wondered is suddenly she decided to quit her job as secretary of state earlier than people were expecting.” denier addressed benghazi and its aftermath in a new book, “a voice for ambassador j. christopher stevens,” commemorating the sacrifice of stevens and the other americans who died in the attack on the american diplomatic compound in september of 2012. she speculated as to the cause of clinton’s departure from office: “did someone tell her, ‘listen, you made a big boo-boo and you have to get out?’ that subject has never been brought to the public.” understandably, she said that hillary clinton can’t be trusted for the country — she certainly proved that she couldn’t handle the one situation that claimed the life of denier’s fiancee. “if we cannot trust her for americans, how can we trust her for the whole country? it doesn’t make sense. in my book, i do talk about that and about what happened … chris was and knew, was extremely knowledgeable about libya and what was going on. he should’ve been listened to,” said denier. the book also took time to celebrate who stevens was as a person. his fiancée understandably remembered him fondly. “the chris stevens i knew was fun and loving, caring, always putting others in front of everything instead of himself,” she said. ultimately, steven gave his life for his country — but he shouldn’t have had to. please share this on facebook and twitter and let us know what you think of stevens, hillary clinton and benghazi. what do you think of hillary clinton's handling of benghazi? scroll down to comment below!      amb. stevens’ fiancee releases book, levels devastating accusation at hillary      
__label__1 it would be foolish to pretend that all police officers are upstanding professionals. just like any profession, there are many, many dedicated professionals and yes, there are some bad ones as well. police officers are people and sometimes they make mistakes and sometimes they’re just plain bad people of low moral character.   however, in a profession that requires people to literally put their lives on the line for the good of society, i feel comfortable asserting that while there are some bad apples to be found, the vast, vast majority of police officers in america are dedicated professionals worthy of respect and who should be offered a degree of freedom from unnecessarily second-guessing life-and-death decisions that must occur in a millisecond. but don’t tell that to the congressional black caucus… the caucus is demanding that radicalized and openly-corrupted attorney general loretta lynch step in to target police officers to help prevent officers throughout the country from reacting with deadly force to black men and women who pose immediate dangers. of course, the caucus does not frame the discussion in exactly that way, but that is the effort all the same. referring to recent high-profile killings of armed black men posing immediate dangers to police officers, rep. maxine waters, d-ca, read the letter to the attorney general outside the department of justice as the adoring media dutifully nodded in agreement. “the world is watching and we cannot continue to ignore these killings,” she grandstanded with the caucus standing in solidarity. the letter urges lynch to “aggressively pursue investigations, indictments and prosecutions through the office of civil rights against any and all law enforcement officers who harm or kill innocent unarmed black men, women and children.” of course, such a demand seems reasonable… if they’re truly innocent people. however, in many recent high-profile cases of blacks being killed by officers of varying ethnicities, the quickly-fabricated narrative concerning the conduct of the deceased radically differs from the reality of the situation that emerges after radicalized social justice warriors have already furthered a fictitious narrative that supports their manipulative media narrative.       congressional black caucus now demanding crack down on police officers nationwide…      
__label__1 one does not have to bleed red, white and blue in order to live in this country. however, whenever i encounter anti-american vitriol that masquerades as “enlightened” political correctness, i always wonder, “if you hate what this country stands for, then why do you live here?” that’s the question that should be posed to those who have forced students to change a school event’s “american theme” because it is supposedly offensive.   students at ramapo college in mahwah, new jersey, were planning on putting on a themed barbecue event for fellow students and faculty. the theme was “america.” as students made preparations for the event, however, they were informed by staff that they would have to change the event as the patriotic theme was too “offensive.” the staffer who issued the edict, bischoff hall assistant residence director ariana rivera, claimed that, among other things, the use of uncle sam on flyers was too “military and recruitment-oriented.” because college students looking for a good pulled pork sandwich might instead join the army? doubtful… rivera claimed that the order came from the administration. when asked who was issuing the order, she replied, “to be honest, i’m not sure. i think it was administrative. i was told that our advertising was too ‘military and recruitment-oriented,’ because we had the uncle sam saying ‘i want you.’ i think? however, we saw other posters with that same idea, so i really don’t know.” the event went forward with a watered-down theme and around 300 students were in attendance. college officials remained elusive and cagey about the reasoning behind the demands and claimed that the issue was a “miscommunication.” still, students tasked with putting on the event have vowed to move forward with finding answers for why there was an issue in the first place. in either case, what seems the most troubling is not just that there seems to be a pervasive element in academia that despises patriotism, but that people have become so comfortable with redundant bureaucracy that orders are passed-on mindlessly without ever discovering who is issuing such ridiculous orders and why. “because we said so” is the mantra of all bureaucratic tyrants.       students fight back after being forced to change bbq ‘american theme’ – because it’s offensive…      
__label__1 if you’re like me, you are eagerly awaiting the donald trump – hillary clinton debate. don’t get me wrong – as a policy nerd, i am disheartened to see that america has embraced two candidates who rely hardly at all on policy discussions.   trump advances himself through no-nonsense rhetoric aimed at americans who are very understandably frustrated with the current culture of political correctness and weakness that permeates every branch of government. hillary advances herself through lies, extortion and skillfully-crafted propaganda designed to hold out just long enough to dupe the american people into giving the unindicted felon a job promotion. still, the debate should be entertaining as hillary has a habit of melting-down when on-the-spot and trump thrives off of pushing back against unfair assertions and unwarranted attacks. to emphasize how this debate is likely to be different, consider how trump would have handled candy crowley’s shameful advocacy she pushed in 2012’s debate. as if going against trump isn’t scary enough, hillary is riding into the debate on a wave of ever-dropping polls. most polls have had hillary up considerably over trump since the conclusion of the primaries. then again, these polls have largely been rigged via selection bias and targeted samplings of respondents. the real clear politics average (which averages the results of dozens of polls) has hillary up by a measly 2.1%. when we account for the “bias factor,” we can see that at best, hillary is dead even with trump. the projections emerging from the polls indicate that given the downward trend hillary is suffering, trump is only a single state away from victory in november. that means a lot can change. the data is having an effect on even the most optimistic analysts. fivethirtyeight has placed hillary’s chance of winning declining from 70.6 percent on september 11th, to 56.8 percent on september 20th. while polls are becoming more and more meaningless (look at karl rove and his little whiteboard), the empirical reality is that americans are souring on hillary the more they learn about her whereas people decided on trump ages ago. many mistakenly believe that this is a two-person race. it’s not. it’s a race between donald trump, hillary clinton and “none of the above.” those who support trump have supported him for quite some time. they’re dedicated and view him as an agent of change. those who vehemently support far-left policies are still embittered by the railroading of bernie sanders and these vote do not necessarily translate to votes for hillary. in a direct, forced match-up between hillary and trump, it may be extremely tight. however, how many democrats are just going to stay home rather than risk the embarrassment of having voted for hillary? an even better question: if hillary cannot stand up to trump in a debate, will that finally demonstrate to liberals the validity of what trump has been saying all along? that she is too weak to stand for america at a time when our prestige is slipping on the international stage?       it’s just days before first debate – and hillary gets more bad news…

__label__1 arizona's laws on child molestation are so broad that a parent changing a diaper could be prosecuted for criminal activity. that is the opinion of defense attorney russ richelsoph and a minority of judges on the arizona supreme court, according to the arizona republic. child molestation in arizona is defined as intentionally or knowingly engaging in sexual contact with a child under the age of 15. sexual contact is interpreted as “direct or indirect touching, fondling or manipulating” of a child’s genitals or private parts. unlike other states, the arizona law does not require there to be an intent to harm, violate or arouse by the alleged perpetrator. in a recent ruling, the arizona supreme court confirmed that proving intent was not necessary. as a result, it ruled that a parent changing a diaper or a physician conducting an examination could be charged with molestation under the current interpretation of the law. “when you have a statute that criminalizes such a broad set of behaviors that everybody’s a criminal, everybody who has changed a diaper, every physician or nurse who has examined the genitals of a child, that’s a huge problem,” defense attorney russ richelsoph told the republic. maricopa county attorney bill montgomery disagreed and believes some common sense has to be observed. “i’m a parent. i have prosecutors who are parents,” montgomery said. “we know the difference between diapering and molesting a child.” montgomery said prosecutors handle such cases carefully. “if a defendant is going to bring that up in trial and we don’t have any evidence to show that there was sexual motivation, then juries are not going to convict, grand jurors are not going to indict,” he told kpnx. the court ruling said that changing the law was the responsibility of politicians. “we agree that the criminal code should clearly differentiate between unlawful conduct and innocent, acceptable behavior without unnecessarily broadly sweeping the latter into the former,” the court opinion stated, the republic reported. two judges authored a dissenting opinion. “parents and other caregivers who have changed an infant’s soiled diaper or bathed a toddler will be surprised to learn that they have committed a class 2 or 3 felony,” the dissenting judges argued. richelsoph described scenarios in which the legislation could be abused. “physicians get accused of molesting children. parents, especially in divorce situations, get accused of molesting children,” richelsoph added. “and then you have someone spending a lot of money on a private defense attorney or having to get a public defender.” sources: the arizona republic, kpnx / photo credit: the arizona republic      arizona parents could go to jail for changing diapers      
__label__1 a mother is outraged after council chiefs removed her deceased son’s star-shaped headstone following a complaint from another family who claimed it wasn’t “in keeping” with the rest of the cemetery. max corbett-gardener was just 4 years old when he passed away after complications from his severe epilepsy. his mother, jo corbett-weeks, 42, saved up $4,580 to design a specially-made headstone featuring a teddy bear holding a star inscribed with a tribute to her son, the daily mail reports.  the heartfelt memorial was erected on max’s grave to commemorate what would have been the boy’s seventh birthday. but three days later, the headstone was removed from great malvern cemetery by council chiefs in worcestershire. “it would have been max's seventh birthday on the sunday, and this was like a birthday present to him from me,” corbett-weeks, who has two other children ages 16 and 5, told bbc. “i chose a star-shaped stone because i wanted something suitable for max - something personal. “this stone is just so perfect for my poor little chap," she added.  a family had complained to the malvern town council that the headstone was not “in keeping” with the rest of the cemetery. corbett-weeks says the stone was then removed without her knowledge or consent and she is demanding that it be reinstated. “i was totally unaware this was going on. the council did not contact me and it was the stonemason who told me he'd been ordered to remove it,” corbett-weeks explained. “i feel upset, distressed and angry. we have been through so much as a family. i could understand if the grave was uncared for or unsightly, but it isn't. “the headstone meant a lot to me and the family but now we are fighting to have it put back," she said. "it's a horrible situation. we just want to have somewhere to grieve.” the memorial was placed in the adult area of the cemetery, where corbett-weeks had her son buried so that he could be close to other family members.  the council said that if the application for the stone had been received within the usual time frame, they would not have given the stonemason permission to install it in the first place. they added that had the star-shaped headstone been installed at the children’s area of the cemetery, it would have been allowed. “we have a conformity of shapes in our lawn cemetery. we were contacted by people who objected to the shape,” a malvern town council spokesman explained to bbc. “the longer it stayed up, the harder the process would have been. “it was a very difficult decision to remove it but one we had to make straight away," the spokesman said. the council added that the complaint was not so much about the shape of the headstone as it was about following protocol. 'it wasn't necessarily an objection to the shape but why we appeared to be applying one rule to one family and other rules to another,” the spokesman continued. “the stonemason in this situation did not have permission to put the stone up - and the stone is not in keeping with the graves in that area. “by not following the correct process he has caused considerable distress to both families," the spokesman concluded. the council is arranging a meeting with corbett-weeks to discuss a new design for her son’s headstone. sources: daily mail, bbc photo credit: bbc, worcestershirenews.co.uk      mother forced to remove deceased 4-year-old's headstone because of just one complaint (photos)      
__label__1 even though america’s focus at this time is either on nfl, or the race between two of the worst candidates in us history, the refugee problem all across the world still rages on and no more so than europe. over the last two years, the violent crimes perpetrated by muslim refugees have shot through the roof. new years of this year, cologne, germany faced several reports of gang rapes by muslim men. not only in germany, but also in sweden and many other european countries. the reports of violence in these host nations have been too much to bear for many of these countries and now one in particular is growing a pair and demanding it gain control of the situation.  hungary’s controversial prime minister has called for the eu to gather up the refugees and send them off to northern africa, or an island north of that, as they would be more accustomed to that particular culture. viktor orban, the prime minister suggested they should be ’rounded up and shipped out’ to ‘an island or some shore of north africa’ where they can make their asylum applications. many claim that orban and his country whose government has been criticized by all sorts of self-righteous ‘rights’ groups for stirring up xenophobia and intolerance…isn’t that just dandy. if you want control over who comes across your borders, you are a xenophobe. to hell with sovereignty. they are basically saying ‘we control you. go against our demands and face our wrath. we own you. slave.’ this country has already put up barbed wire fences and they are catching flak for that too. listen world… you all have your own countries, so mind your own damn business. if you are so disgusted about this hungary thing, then you take them into your country. what kills me is all hungary is asking for is that they do their asylum application before they are allowed into the country. ‘those who came illegally must be rounded up and shipped out. we must set up large refugee camps outside the eu, with armed security and financial support provided by the union. everyone who came illegally must return there. there they can file for asylum.’ did you catch that word, you progressive socialists? he said ‘illegally’. rules and laws are there for all to follow. law and order.         controversial leader calls for illegal immigrants to be rounded up and deported to guarded island… [video]

__label__1 the black man, keith lamont scott, who was shot by a black police officer in north carolina, was caught on dash cam footage getting out of his car with a gun drawn from a thigh holster he was wearing. he got back in the car and then got back out again, brandishing the weapon at the police – brandishing does not mean pointing by the way. the officer shot and killed scott because he was a clear and present danger to the officers. scott’s family has now watched the video from several angles showing that scott did indeed have a gun and was threatening the officers after repeatedly being told to drop his weapon. now the family has no comment and neither does their attorney. sounds like a justified shooting to me. they lied about the book and ginned up riots there. then they had a muslim spokesman come in and incite violence. they should all be arrested as far as i’m concerned.  from young conservatives: the family of keith lamont scott, the black man killed by a black cop after being ordered repeatedly to drop his weapon, said “no comment” when asked after watching video of the incident if the police were in the right. if that isn’t an admission then their lawyer wouldn’t have told them to say “no comment.” clearly, the video must’ve shown that scott was not obeying police officers (which we already know to be the case). had the family’s lawyers even for a second thought the cops were out of line, they would’ve instructed the family to scream bloody murder. tell me i’m wrong. i’m not, but you can tell me anyways. these riots cost the life of one protester and got not only other protesters hurt, but police officers as well. an emergency was declared by the governor and the national guard had to come in. these riots will carry a heavy price tag. the police chief says there is no definitive proof in the video that scott aimed the gun at the officers. it doesn’t matter. he had it in his hand and would not drop it. the officer that shot him followed procedure and the video bears that out. that is why the family is not screaming bloody murder over the video. they saw that scott was indeed a threat and that is why he was taken down.   just in: #keithlamontscott family just reviewed police shooting video; asked if video supports police, attorneys say “no comment” @wsoctv — dashawn brown (@dashawnwsoc9) september 22, 2016    #keithscott attorney asked if video showed presence of gun @wsoctv pic.twitter.com/06kxvheub5 — dashawn brown (@dashawnwsoc9) september 22, 2016    #keithlamontscott attorney says family viewed several angles of shooting video as often as they wanted; body cam, dash cams, dvrs @wsoctv — dashawn brown (@dashawnwsoc9) september 22, 2016          keith lamont scott’s family views police video of shooting – after inciting nc riot, now they claim “no comment”… [video]      
__label__1 blue bell just did the one thing we all hoped would never happen again, this is a nightmare. in 2015 we were all devastated when our favorite ice cream had a huge recall taking it off the shelves for months. this was their first recall in over 100 years! eventually toward the end of 2016 we started seeing blue bell back out on the shelves, but now there has been another recall on the products!  the company is now voluntarily recalling several of their ice-cream products because they are concerned that they may contain “listeria bacteria”. unfortunately, they have recalled two of their products that contain chocolate chip cookie dough. blue bell stated that the dough was being made by a third party known as aspen hills inc. the good news is that there haven’t been any reports of illness from the ice cream but blue bell is wanting to take precautions before their are any. the company posted the recall on their facebook yesterday. “out of an abundance of caution, we are voluntarily recalling select products that contain a chocolate chip cookie dough ingredient. aspen hills, inc., who supplies us with this ingredient, has issued a voluntary recall on select lots of chocolate chip cookie dough supplied to blue bell. no illnesses have been reported to date, but blue bell is taking this step because we remain committed to producing a safe, high-quality, great-tasting ice cream for you and your family to enjoy.”  apparently the ice cream was distributed in 10 states: alabama, florida, georgia, kentucky, louisiana, mississippi, north carolina, south carolina, tennessee and virginia. blue bell also posted a list of recalled products to ensure that no one is eating them. blue bell ice cream half gallons: code dates blue bell chocolate chip cookie dough 082618226 blue bell cookie two step 080418222, 081818224 blue bell ice cream pints: code dates blue bell chocolate chip cookie dough 081518242, 082418242 aspen hills inc. wrote a letter about the recall stating that the contaminated cookie dough could cause fever, headaches, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. not only that but if you are pregnant the infection can cause miscarriages and still-births. blue bell was sold in over 30 states before their huge recall last year, and some of those places are barely getting the ice cream back out on the shelves. one store in particular recited their shipment of blue bell only two days before the big recall! we’re all smiles in raleigh, nc, because blue bell is back! look for it in stores in raleigh, durham, chapel hill and surrounding areas. pic.twitter.com/wuzagusph0 — blue bell ice cream (@ilovebluebell) september 19, 2016  this is so sad!! share this with everyone you know!!      blue bell just announced another massive recall      
__label__1 as if this week was not tragic enough, we get hit with this news. it seems as if every member of nascar is beloved in some form or fashion. there are just some really fine people involved within this sport, and there has been for years and years. a cool thing about nascar is that it’s not just the drivers that are well known and loved. it’s their crew chiefs or family members. it’s executives, hardcore fans and amazing reporters. everyone has an amazing role to play in the sport of nascar. sadly, two of those beloved members have passed away. bob margolis and herbert ames. two of some of the finest men in all of nascar.  herbert was more of a beloved friend of nascar. he was involved in many things that gave on the behalf of the sport, and he was long time friends with almost everybody in nascar. tom jensen, reporter for fox sports, expressed herbert’s personality in a great way: “if you walked up to him and asked what he did in the sport, he’d bellow loudly and say, ‘whatever the hell i want to do!'” margolis was known for being a first-rate writer and reporter for nascar. he was different than everybody else because he gave younger writers a chance to really show what they got in the complicated world of nascar. he always told it exactly how it was and was loved for that. it’s clear that bob captured the hearts of many more than he probably ever knew. both of these are already extremely missed by many in the nascar community, as they are mourning their losses. i played a little golf with jim hunter and herbert ames… i can only imagine the heckling taking place between those two right now. #rip — jimmie johnson (@jimmiejohnson) september 22, 2016  my thoughts are also with the family and friends of @bobmargolis. — jimmie johnson (@jimmiejohnson) september 22, 2016  to hear we lost @bobmargolis this morning is hard to fathom…i'll cherish the time & conversations we shared over the past couple of years. — daniel hemric (@danielhemric) september 22, 2016  i listened intently to what bob margolis had to say. he understood the complexities of the sport & hit them head-on. prayers to his family. — jim cassidy (@jfcassidy) september 22, 2016  it’s always horrible to lose great people, but we know they’re in a much better place than here! our thoughts and prayers are with both of these men’s friends and families as they navigate what to do in the coming days.       two nascar legends just died, you will truly be missed bob and herbert      
__label__1 animals behave better than this. after the shooting of a black man by a black police officer, things spiraled out of control in charlotte, north carolina. last night was a lot more peaceful, but the two previous nights were hellish. one protester eventually died after another protester fired randomly into the crowd and shot him in the head. almost a dozen police were hurt as were numerous protesters. bricks, bottles, rocks, plants… whatever they could find, protesters threw at the police. the police in turn used tear gas, pepper spray and flash grenades. it was a war zone. all of this started when the suspect’s family starting spreading the false story that the man was unarmed and reading a book while he waited for his son to get home from school. no book was found, but a gun was. the man got out of his car with a gun drawn from a thigh holster. he got back in the car and then got out again with the gun once more. an officer shot him after he repeatedly refused to drop the weapon. his family incited violence and rioting as did a muslim man who represented them. they should be arrested.  from the federalist papers project: robert gehl reports that rioters in charlotte in their second night in a row rampaging the city tried to throw a photographer into a bonfire they started in the middle of the street. local station wccb reported in a tweet wednesday night that its reporters witnessed “protesters” trying to burn the photographer alive.  the statement was repeated by marvin beach, a reporter for wccb on their live stream. beach said the station’s photographer witnessed the attack. as the daily caller reports, it’s unclear exactly why they tried to throw the photographer on the fire, or why it failed, but the livestream apparently later captured police providing assistance to the unnamed photographer, indicated he was unharmed. the photographer was apparently white, raising the specter that he was targeted because of his race – there have been many cases of race-oriented violence during the two-day chaos. the worst example of the barbaric behavior that occurred this week was when a white photographer was grabbed by black lives matter goons who then tried to throw him into a fire and burn him alive. he was evidently unharmed, but that could have cost him his life. a statement by a reporter named marvin beach on wccb’s livestream of the riots, said the station’s photographer witnessed the attack. it’s unclear why the effort failed, but wccb’s livestream later captured police providing assistance to the photographer, indicating he was rescued without suffering grievous harm. what kind of monsters do something like this simply because of race? they are doing everything they say they are protesting against. this will not end well if it keeps up.  this is what you wanted, america.https://t.co/fltyk3irt2 — roark (@roark__) september 22, 2016          who do you think you’re fooling blacklivesmatter? protest vs riot – there’s a difference, take note… [video]      
__label__1 soros believes that he is god and that he controls america!  interesting opinion as he is an atheist! well, he has been doing a pretty good job at trying to control america and that is for sure! americantoday reports: george soros claims he is a god and “the creator of everything,” however the billionaire globalist also warns he is a “self-centred” god who believes “normal rules do not apply” to him. “i fancied myself as some kind of god …” he wrote. “if truth be known, i carried some rather potent messianic fantasies with me from childhood, which i felt i had to control, otherwise they might get me in trouble.“ when asked by britain’s independent newspaper to elaborate on that statement, soros doubled down: “it is a sort of disease when you consider yourself some kind of god, the creator of everything, but i feel comfortable about it now since i began to live it out.“ “next to my fantasies about being god, i also have very strong fantasies of being mad,” soros once confided on british television. “in fact, my grandfather was actually paranoid. i have a lot of madness in my family. so far i have escaped it.” soros has made his wealth on the backs of millions in poverty, yet he is the king of decrying how unfair america is because of its greatness. he has, in fact, created more poverty around the world than he could ever complain about!  why doesn’t he just give away his money to the poor, and live as he would like others to live? because he is just another far left hypocrite who cares about no one except george soros. ugly he is, on the inside and out! it is ok! someday george, you will know who god is! philippians 2:9 therefore god also has highly exalted him and given him the name which is above every name, 10 that at the name of jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, 11 and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord, to the glory of god the father.           george soros: ‘i am a god, i created everything, i control america and hillary’ george soros has finally lost the last tiny bit of mind he had left!      
__label__1 this is a true story.  general stanley mcchrystal was the commander of us forces in afghanistan and he had frequent disagreements on the conduct of the war with his commander-in-chief. at one point mcchrystal was called into the oval office and he knew his army career was about to be over. when former u.s. military commander in afghanistan, stanley mcchrystal, was called into the oval office by barack obama, he knew things weren’t going to go well when the president accused him of not supporting him in his political role as president. “it’s not my job to support you as a politician, mr. president, it’s my job to support you as commander-in-chief,” mcchrystal replied, and he handed obama his resignation.  barack obama has a long history of hating the us military and men and women who serve.  he is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance. not satisfied with accepting mcchrystal’s resignation the president made a cheap parting shot. “i bet when i die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.” the general saluted. “mr. president, i always told myself after leaving the army i’d never stand in line again. good job general mcchrystal.  i’m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won’t have to stand in line.  you’re an honorable man, we know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.      obama: “i bet when i die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.”      
__label__1 the first presidential debate was monday and letâs just say that donald trump had a bad night. one of the gop candidateâs easiest lies to expose was his insistence that âstop and friskââ wasnât ruled unconstitutional. heâs wrong, it absolutely was. debate moderator lester holt asked trump about his recent arguments in favor of âstop and friskâ and mentioned that the court has declared the practice unconstitutional on the grounds that it is discriminatory. ââstop and friskâ was ruled unconstitutional in new york, because it largely singled out black and hispanic young men â â trump cut holt off mid-sentence:â âno, youâre wrong. it went before a judge who was a very against police judge. it was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. they would have won an appeal.â factcheck:â u.s. district court judge shira a. scheindlin ruled âstop and friskâ to be unconstitutionalâ august 12, 2013.â according to the center for constitutional rights,â âjudge shira scheindlin found the nypdâs practices to violate new yorkers âfourth amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and also found that the practices were racially discriminatory in violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment,â the bloomberg administration did appeal the ruling. the order was then suspended by the second circuit court of appeals and the case was sent back to be tried againâ with a new judge presiding over the proceedings. however, the court shot down the cityâs motion and decided not to vacateâ scheindlinâs decision. the appeal was eventually dropped byâ the de blasio administration. trump, who has run a bigoted campaign right from the start, was completely undeterred by holtâs assertion of the facts and continued to argue vehemently in favor of the discriminatory policing practice. watch trump wrongly argue that âstop and friskâ wasnât ruled unconstitutional, even though it was, here:        trump insists stop and frisk wasnât ruled unconstitutional â heâs wrong, it was (video)      
__label__1 fox news host megyn kelly seemed to take a shot at sean hannity on monday night after the much anticipated first presidential debate when she had to throw the live coverage to an interview between her colleague and republican nominee donald trump. hannity has been a prime target for just about everyone ever since trump was formally nominated during the last night of the republican national convention in july. former host jon stewart got the ball rolling that night by torching hannity for being a complete hypocrite when it comes to how he has covered president obama in the past to how he treats donald trump now. not long after that, foreign affairs columnist bret stephens called hannity the “dumbest anchor on fox news,” and the followed up by calling hannity out for lying about trump coming to the rescue of u.s. marines. then cnn’s brian stelter piled on by nailing hannity for lying about hillary clinton, and reporter kurt eichenwald slammed hannity for claiming that hillary suffers seizures. and now hannity is getting shade from one of his own colleagues. during the post-debate analysis on fox news, kelly had to introduce hannity’s interview with donald trump. and as she introduced the interview, kelly wondered if trump would be talking to the actual journalists in the room afterward. ”we’ve got trump speaking to our own sean hannity. we’ll see whether he speaks to the journalists in this room after that interview.” here’s the video via youtube.  trump and hannity proceeded to trash hillary clinton, but it looks like the main focus will be on kelly for basically telling a lying commentator like hannity to go f*ck himself. and he definitely deserved the shade. after all, hannity is not a real journalist. he ignores facts and peddles bullshit and frankly shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near the airwaves. hannity is trump’s puppet and he clearly cannot be fair and balanced as the network he works for advertises.       watch: megyn kelly takes a shot at hannity by wondering when trump will talk to a real journalist      
__label__1 for weeks, donald trump and his henchmen have tried to paint a picture of hillary clinton that suggests she’s physically and mentally unfit to be the next president. whenever clinton coughed, they would claim she had one foot in the grave. when she fainted on 9/11, trump and his people were pounced with glee. then we discover she tried to tough it out with walking pneumonia, and suddenly they turned that into an attack on her honesty. so going into the presidential debates, everyone was waiting for trump to unleash some sort of attack on clinton’s health. and once it started to become apparent that he was losing the debate, the billionaire did just that. when addressing the issue of race in america, trump said: “you look at the inner cities, and i just left detriot, and i just left philidelphia. and i just…you know. you’ve seen me i’ve been all over the place. uh, you decided to stay home and i mean that’s okay…but i will tell you. i’ve been all over and i’ve met some of the greatest people i’ll ever meet within these communities. and they are very very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.” clinton’s response was perfect. “i think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. and yes i did. and you know what else i prepared for?” there was a slight pause before she continued: “i prepared to be president and i think that’s a good thing.” image via giphy the expression on trump’s face following clinton’s comeback was priceless. see for yourself.  some critics pointed out that clinton’s “gotcha line” came off as rehearsed. but isn’t that sort of the point she was making? the point is that clinton did rehearse, she studied, and prepared, not just for one debate, but also for an important job that entails far more significant consequences for bad decisions than low tv ratings and lawsuits. america saw just who the real adult was in this contest and at the end of the day that’s the person you hire to do the most important job in the world. featured image via youtube.  only in america can some smarty-pants negro think that teaching american students to exercise their american freedom of speech guaranteed by the american constitution can be considered american.      trump goes sexist on clinton and she knocks him out with debate stopping comeback (video)

__label__1 donald trump spent monday night making a total ass out of himself in the first presidential debate. we were all waiting to see just what would happen tonight, and it was quite the spectacle. from lies to self-incrimination, watching the gop nomineeâs performance was the equivalentâ of one facepalm after another. so here you go, aâ complete listâ of every batshit crazy thing that came out of donald trumpâs mouth during the first presidential debate: âthereâs nobody in our government to fight them [china], and we have a very good fight, and we have a winning fight.â â  âtheyâre using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild china and many other countries are doing the same thing.â â  âwe have to stop these countries from stealing our companies.â â  âour countryâs in deep trouble. â we donât know what weâre doing with devaluationsâ¦ especially when it comes to china, theyâre the best. â theyâre the best ever at it. what theyâre doing to us is a very very sad thing.â â  âthatâs called business, by the way.â (referring to making money off of the 2007 financial collapse) â  âiâm a great believer in all forms of energyâ¦ our country is losing a so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.â â  âi will bring back jobs. â you canât bring back jobs.â â  âthatâs about all youâve got.â (referring to clintonâs book we are stronger together) â  âyou are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. â you are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. â you are going to drive businesses out.â â  âiâm going to cut taxes, big-league. â you are going to raise taxes, big-league.â â  âand take a look at mine also.â (referring to his campaign website) â  âshe tells us how to fight isis on her website. â i donât think douglas macarthur would like that too muchâ¦ youâre telling the enemy everything you want to do. â no wonder youâve been fighting isis your entire adult life.â â  âwell, iâm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs. â theyâre going to expand their companies. â theyâre going to do a tremendous job.â (hahahaha) â  âiâm getting rid of the carried interest provision, and if you really look, itâs really not a great thing for the wealthy, itâs really a great thing for middle class.â (methinks thou dost protest too much) â  âthese people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies. â and when theyâre going to bring 2.5 trillion dollars back from overseas, where they canât bring the money back because politicians like secretary clinton wonât allow them to bring the money back because the taxes are so onerous and the bureaucratic red tape is so bad.â (or because those companies are greedy and un-american, just saying) â  âso, what theyâre doing is leaving our country, and believe it or not, theyâre leaving our country because the taxes are too high. â because some of them companies have lots of money outside our country, and instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work because they canât work out a deal. â and everybody agrees it should be brought back, instead of that theyâre leaving our country to get their money because they canât bring their money back into our country, because of bureacratic red tape. â because they canât get together, because we have a president that canât sit them around a table, and get them to approve something.â â (maybe companies should just pay their taxes so we donât need to cut valuable public services) â  âwe have no leadership, and honestly, that starts with secretary clintonâ¦ why not [blame clinton for everything]?â â  âweâre in a bubble right now, and the only thing that looks good is the stock market.â â  âwe have a fed that is doing political thingsâ¦ the fed is being more political than secretary clintonâ â  âwhen we have a country thatâs doing so badly, thatâs being ripped off by every single country in the world, itâs the kind of thinking that our country needs.â â  âwe have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.â (in response to a question about his taxes) â  âiâve been under audit for almost 15 years. â i know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. â i say, âhave you been audited?â â i get audited almost every year, and in a way i should be complaining. â iâm not even complaining. â i donât mind it. â itâs almost become a way of life. â i get audited by the irs, but other people donât.â â  âwe have a situation in this country that needs to be taken care of. â i will release my tax returns against my lawyers wishesâ¦â â  âthat makes me smart.â (in response to paying zero dollars in federal income taxes) â  âi could give you a list of banks, if that would help you. â i would give you a list of banks. â these are very fine institutions, very fine banks. â i could do that very quickly.â â  âi have a tremendous income. â the reason i say that is not in a braggadocios way.â â  âitâs about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.â â  âour airports are like from a third world countryâ¦ weâve become a third world country. â the worst of all things has happened.â â  âand itâs really a shame. and itâs politicians like secretary clinton that have caused this problem. our country has tremendous problems. weâre a debtor nation. weâre a serious debtor nation. and we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. and we donât have the money, because itâs been squandered on so many of your ideas.â â  âit would be squandered, too, believe me.â (in response to not paying any federal income taxes) â  âmaybe he didnât do a good job and i was unsatisfied with his workâ¦ which our country should do, too.â (referring to not paying people who worked for him) âbut on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. and when secretary clinton talks about people that didnât get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation. â now, if you want to change the laws, youâve been there a long time, change the laws. but i take advantage of the laws of the nation because iâm running a company. my obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. and thatâs what i do.â (referring to bankrupting four companies and not paying his business debts) âbut what she doesnât say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. iâll give you an example. weâre just opening up on pennsylvania avenue right next to the white house, so if i donât get there one way, iâm going to get to pennsylvania avenue another.â â  âwhen we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.â â  âwell, first of all, secretary clinton doesnât want to use a couple of words, and thatâs law and order. and we need law and order. if we donât have it, weâre not going to have a country.â â  ânow, whether or not in a place like chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, mayor giuliani is here, worked very well in new york.â â  âwe have to be â we have to know what weâre doing. right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.â â  âno, youâre wrong. it went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. it was taken away from her. and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. they would have won an appeal. if you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where itâs allowed.â (referring to racial profiling becoming outlawed as unconstitutional) â  âwe need law and order. and we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by whatâs happening are african-american and hispanic people. and itâs very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.â â  âi have the endorsement of the nra, which iâm very proud of. these are very, very good people.â â  âbut i think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. and when people are on there, even if they shouldnât be on there, weâll help them, weâll help them legally, weâll help them get off. but i tend to agree with that quite strongly.â â  âbut stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of new york city. tremendous beyond belief. so when you say it has no impact, it really did. it had a very, very big impact.â â  âtheyâve been abused and used in order to get votes by democrat politicians, because thatâs what it is. theyâve controlled these communities for up to 100 years.â â  âyou know, youâve seen me, iâve been all over the place. you decided to stay home, and thatâs ok. but i will tell you, iâve been all over. and iâve met some of the greatest people iâll ever meet within these communities.â â  âwhen i got involved, i didnât fail. i got him to give the birth certificate. so iâm satisfied with it. and iâll tell you why iâm satisfied with itâ¦â but i was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. and i think i did a good jobâ¦â well, it was very â i say nothing. i say nothing, because i was able to get him to produce it. he should have produced it a long time before. i say nothing.â â  âbut let me just tell you. when you talk about healing, i think that iâve developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the african-american community. i think you can see that. â and i feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusionâ â  âand i think i did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.â â  âfirst of all, i got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against barack obama. you treated him with terrible disrespect. â and i watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. it doesnât work that way. you were after him.â â  ânow, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when i was very young, i went into my fatherâs company, had a real estate company in brooklyn and queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country â it was a federal lawsuit â were sued. we settled the suit with zero â with no admission of guilt. it was very easy to do.â â  âand, you know, i also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which i donât do on you. maybe iâm trying to save the money.â â  âbut, frankly, i look â i look at that, and i say, isnât that amazing? because i settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and itâs just one of those things.â â  âiâll go one step further. in palm beach, florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, i opened a club, and really got great credit for it. no discrimination against african- americans, against muslims, against anybody. and itâs a tremendously successful club. and iâm so glad i did it. and i have been given great credit for what i did. and iâm very, very proud of it. and thatâs the way i feel. that is the true way i feel.â â  âin addition, i was just endorsed by ice. theyâve never endorsed anybody before on immigration. i was just endorsed by ice.â â  âas far as the cyber, i agree to parts of what secretary clinton said. we should be better than anybody else, and perhaps weâre not. i donât think anybody knows it was russia that broke into the dnc. sheâs saying russia, russia, russia, but i donât â maybe it was. i mean, it could be russia, but it could also be china. it could also be lots of other people. it also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, ok?â â  ânow, whether that was russia, whether that was china, whether it was another country, we donât know, because the truth is, under president obama weâve lost control of things that we used to have control over.â â  âwe came in with the internet, we came up with the internet, and i think secretary clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what isis is doing with the internet, theyâre beating us at our own game. isis.â â  âso we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. it is â it is a huge problem. i have a son. heâs 10 years old. he has computers. he is so good with these computers, itâs unbelievable. the security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. and maybe itâs hardly doable.â â  âbut i will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. but thatâs true throughout our whole governmental society. we have so many things that we have to do betterâ¦â and certainly cyber is one of them.â â  âso she talks about taking them out. sheâs been doing it a long time. sheâs been trying to take them out for a long time. but they wouldnât have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. and then you wouldnât have had them.â (speaking about the creation of isis) â  âor, as iâve been saying for a long time, and i think youâll agree, because i said it to you once, had we taken the oil â and we should have taken the oil â isis would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. and now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil â a lot of the oil in libya.â â  âwrongâ¦ wrong. â wrong.â â  âthe secretary said very strongly about working with â weâve been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyoneâs ever seen.â â  âbut you look at the middle east, you started the iran deal, thatâs another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, i mean, they were doing so badly. they were choking on the sanctions. and now theyâre going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way theyâre going.â â  ânumber one, the 28 countries of nato, many of them arenât paying their fair share. number two â and that bothers me, because we should be asking â weâre defending them, and they should at least be paying us what theyâre supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.â â  âand, number two, i said, and very strongly, nato could be obsolete, because â and i was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the new york times, which is unusual for the new york times, to be honest â but i said, they do not focus on terror. and i was very strong. and i said it numerous times.â â  âand about four months ago, i read on the front page of the wall street journal that nato is opening up a major terror division. and i think thatâs great. and i think we should get â because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of nato. itâs a lot of money to protect other people. but iâm all for nato. but i said they have to focus on terror, also. â and theyâre going to do that. and that was â believe me â iâm sure iâm not going to get credit for it â but that was largely because of what i was saying and my criticism of nato.â â  âand believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. not only that, you named the day. they couldnât believe it. they sat back probably and said, i canât believe it.â â  âbut you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. now itâs in over 30 countries. and youâre going to stop them? i donât think so.â â  âthat is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she â frankly, i think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.â â  âwell, i have much better judgment than she does. thereâs no question about that. i also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?â â  âi have a much better â she spent â let me tell you â she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising â you know, they get madison avenue into a room, they put names â oh, temperament, letâs go after â i think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. i have a winning temperament. i know how to win. she does not have aâ¦â â  âwait. the afl-cio the other day, behind the blue screen, i donât know who you were talking to, secretary clinton, but you were totally out of control. i said, thereâs a person with a temperament thatâs got a problem.â â  âwrongâ¦ itâs liesâ¦â that lineâs getting a little bit old, i must say. i would like toâ¦â itâs not an accurate one at all. itâs not an accurate one. so i just want to give a lot of things â and just to respond.â â  âi agree with her on one thing. the single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your â your president thinks. â nuclear is the single greatest threat.â â  âjust to go down the list, we defend japan, we defend germany, we defend south korea, we defend saudi arabia, we defend countries. they do not pay us. but they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and weâre losing a fortune. thatâs why weâre losing â weâre losing â we lose on everything. i say, who makes these â we lose on everything.â â  âall i said, that itâs very possible that if they donât pay a fair share, because this isnât 40 years ago where we could do what weâre doing. we canât defend japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million.â â  âall i said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. weâre a country that owes $20 trillion. they have to help us out.â â  âwell, i have to say that, you know, for what secretary clinton was saying about nuclear with russia, sheâs very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. but russia has been expanding their â they have a much newer capability than we do. we have not been updating from the new standpoint.â â  âwe are not â we are not keeping up with other countries. i would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. but i would certainly not do first strike.â â  âi think that once the nuclear alternative happens, itâs over. at the same time, we have to be prepared. i canât take anything off the table.â â  âbecause you look at some of these countries, you look at north korea, weâre doing nothing there. china should solve that problem for us. china should go into north korea. china is totally powerful as it relates to north korea.â â  âwhy didnât you add other things into the deal? one of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. nobodyâs ever seen that before. that turned out to be wrong. it was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, i guess for the hostages. it certainly looks that way. â so you say to yourself, why didnât they make the right deal? this is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.â â  âand theyâre going to end up getting nuclear. i met with bibi netanyahu the other day. believe me, heâs not a happy camper.â â  âbut i will tell you that hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat isis, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. right now, itâs getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because theyâre in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.â â  âand she doesnât say that, because sheâs got no business ability. we need heart. we need a lot of things. but you have to have some basic ability. and sadly, she doesnât have that.â â  âall you have to do is speak to them. wait. you have so many different things you have to be able to do, and i donât believe that hillary has the stamina.â â  âthe world â let me tell you. let me tell you. hillary has experience, but itâs bad experience. we have made so many bad deals during the last â so sheâs got experience, that i agree. â but itâs bad, bad experience.â â  âi never said thatâ¦ i didnât say thatâ¦ where did you find this?â¦ oh, really?â â  âyou know, hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. some of itâs said in entertainment. some of itâs said â somebody whoâs been very vicious to me, rosie oâdonnell, i said very tough things to her, and i think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.â â  âbut you want to know the truth? â iâ was going to say somethingâ¦â extremely rough to hillary, to her family, and i said to myself, âi canât do it. i just canât do it. itâs inappropriate. itâs not nice.â wow. in hindsight, it would have probably been easier to list the things trump said that completely and utterly ridiculous. when it finally came time to face off with hillary clinton on the debate stage, trump failed miserably and totally embarrassedâ himself. as hillary said monday night, donald âlives in his own reality,â presumably a reality where he thinks he actually makes sense.       here you go: every bat sh*t crazy thing that came out of trumpâs mouth in the first debate      
__label__1 if you tuned into the first presidential debate last night, youâ already know that hillary clinton pretty much wiped the floor with donald trump. trump was so nervous and unprepared that he was reduced to constant sniffling, excessive thirstiness and his usual outlandish rants and interruptions. letâs just say that everyone noticed. trump couldnât take the heat, and he definitely cannot handle the humiliationâ that is following the debate. while several major media outlets are calling the debate a clear win for clinton, trump is trying to come up with reasons why he bombed so horribly (even though it was perfectly obvious that he would). the best excuse trump hasâ been able to come up with is beyond pathetic and nothing but a move of desperation. the associated press has reported that after the debate, the gop nominee immediately told reporters that he was unable to perform to the best of his ability because there was something wrong with his microphone. and yet despite something being âwrong with it,â that micâ seemed to work fine as he shouted over hillaryâ every few seconds.â ap reported: âtrump visited the media spin room after the monday night debate and said, âthey gave me a defective mic!ââ he said he âwonder(s), was that on purpose?ââ cbsâsâ sopan debâ also happened to be there and gave a little more detail into trumpâs microphone conspiracy theory: twitter trump is seriously trying to claim that someone tried to sabotage the debate on purpose! what a moron. the truth is that trump didnât prepare for the debate like clinton did â and even if he had spent a little more time preparing than tweeting, it wouldnât have mattered much â heâs completely unqualified for the white house. last night, hillaryâ showed america that these two shouldnât even be up against each other. there is no comparison. hillaryâ looked like our next president, and trump looked like a fraud and an imposter whoâ should have never made it up on that stage. i wouldnât be surprised if trump comes up with more lame stories about why his performance was compromisedâ last night.       trump gives pathetic reason for why he sucked at debate (tweet)      
__label__1 anyone watching monday nightâs highly charged presidential debate between hillary clinton and donald trump knows that hillary cleaned trumpâs clock. of course, trumpâs ego will never let him admit that he lost to hillary, so his surrogates are already being deployed all over the place to spin his embarrassingly terrible debate performance into something positive. the verbal gymnastics there are astounding, but of course these people are donald trump surrogates, so they are used to spinning faster than the head of the girl in the exorcist. one trump surrogate, former new york city mayor rudy giuliani, is taking things a step further, though, and trying to float the idea that trump should refuse to do future debates with hillary. of course, this is just a cowardly move because of trumpâs abysmal performance. but giuliani is the trump spinner-in-chief, and instead decided to blame the fact that nbc moderator lester holt actually called trump out on his lies on his suggestion that trump should skip out next time. giuliani whined that holtâs fact-checking was unfair treatment of trump, and therefore if it were him, he wouldnât debate again without certain petty, childish demands being met: âif i were donald trump, i wouldnât participate in another debate unless i was promised the journalist would act like a journalist, and not an ignorant fact check.â my advice would be the moderator would have to promise theyâd be a moderator.â when pressed, giuliani refused to say whether or not he would advise trump to find a way out of debating hillary again, only that if it were him, it is what he would do. this is in direct contrast with trumpâs campaign manager kellyanne conway, who insists trump will do both future debates. while both candidates had nothing but good things to say about holtâs moderation, giuliani lit into holt regarding the stop and frisk question, saying that the moderatorâs âinterferenceâregarding the controversial policy and its effects on new york city was âoutrageous.â however, considering that trump has floated the idea of a nationwide stop and frisk policy, the discussion on that subject and its racist implementation was perfectly reasonable. that didnât stop giuliani from outright lying in his rant, though, when he said: âif journalism has ethics, lester holt unethically interfering in the area of law he knows nothing about.â it is not unconstitutional and trumpâs description of that case was correct.â but, again, this is a lie â a federal judge definitely ruled the policy unconstitutional. at the end of the day, giulianiâs tantrum is only because he wants his candidate to be able to lie with impunity in front of millions, because most trump voters are low information plebes, or they simply donât care about trumpâs bigotry, lies, incompetence, and just general all-around douchebaggery. however, if he gets called out on a debate stage, it makes him look like a fool to undecided voters, who are much more likely to vote for hillary if they are going to leave third-party camps. if trump drops out of future debates, he and his surrogates will blame lester holt, the so-called âliberalâ media, and anyone and anything besides trump himself. rudy giuliani is just laying the groundwork for that right now.       giuliani already trying to float excuses for trump to weasel out of future debates      
__label__1 in the first half of the debate, donald trump seemed bogged down by some very distracting sniffles. after peddling for weeks a lucrative conspiracy that hillary clinton is too sick to be commander-in-chief, one must ask themselves why trump couldnât stop sniffling. is he sick? was he holding back tears (after being pummeled by clinton)? howard dean, former head of the dnc and presidential candidate, has a more unconventional answer: he was on drugs. dean, who is now a contributor forâ msnbc, tweeted last night: notice trump sniffing all the time. coke user? â howard dean (@govhowarddean) september 27, 2016 trump supporters took to twitter to express outrage, completely forgetting that their preferred candidate spent weeks fueling sexist attacks against clinton and her stamina abilities. but hey, get offended when dean points out what could be the obvious. after all, trump did protect a cocaine trafficker from serving proper jail time by pulling some strings in the justice system. and considering he hasnât released any medical records, who knows what adverse effects drugs (if he does them) has done to his body and mental state. of course trump denied he was sniffling, even though the rancid sounds were heard by millions of watchers across the country (and the globe) and the republican nominee denies that he is sick. so that begs the question: what else could it be. deanâs assertion is just that â an assertion. it has no factual ground to stand on, but it is ironic to see how trump supporters react when a conspiracy is made againstâ candidate. perhaps they (and trump) will think long and hard before trying to paint clinton as anything sheâs not. if this debate showed one thing, itâs that hillary came out on top and trump is not happy about it. why not have a little fun at his petulant behavior? howard dean is.       howard dean roasts trump over debate sniffles: âcoke userâ? (tweets)      
__label__1 a reporter for the washington post, david fahrenthold, has uncovered another instance where gop nominee donald trump has made some questionable tax-related choices. the investigation that faherenthold launched into the trump foundation, along with republican presidential nominee donald trump’s personal finances, has unearthed the fact that donald trump has used his charitable foundation, which is tax-exempt, as a tool to evade $2.3 million dollars of personal income taxes. how? by having business associates that owe him money to put it into his foundation instead. an excellent example is that the trump foundation took in payments “totaling nearly $1.9 million from a man in new york city who sells sought-after tickets and one-of-a-kind experiences to wealthy clients.” according to sources in the trump organization who wish to remain anonymous the man is richard ebers, and he was told that instead of paying the former reality tv star for services, he should pay the trump foundation instead. it makes sense really, when you consider the fact that despite the reality that donald trump hasn’t even bothered donating to his own foundation since 2008 the “donations” continue to pour in. one of republican presidential nominee donald trump’s senior advisers, boris epshteyn, actually tried to explain it away by saying: ‘what trump did was provide a service, renounce any fees, and then merely “suggest” that the other party make a donation to a charity of their choosing.’ the irony is not lost on anyone that he’s basically saying it’s legal, and it is, despite the fact that anyone with half a mind deduce the shady implications. marc owens, head of the internal revenue service’s non-profit watchdog agency, hasn’t been very thorough in his monitoring of the trump foundation and seems shocked by all of the information that fahrenthold’s investigation has managed to uncover. owens, said: ‘this is so bizarre, this laundry list of issues. it’s the first time i’ve ever seen this, and i’ve been doing this for 25 years in the irs, and 40 years total.’ it’s pretty obvious to anyone that’s paying attention that the gop nominee is probably violating the rules that were written to prevent this kind of blatant laundering of money when it comes to tax-exempt foundations. if donald trump were to be charged and found guilty of violating these laws the punishment would mean a monetary penalty, losing the tax-exempt status for his foundation, and even, perhaps, criminal charges being filed. when asked by journalist sharyl attkisson: ‘are you confident that the trump foundation has followed all charitable rules and laws?’ republican presidential nominee donald trump responded: ‘well, i hope so… i mean, my lawyers do it.’ it’s kind of ironic that the trump campaign would go after the clinton foundation when republican presidential nominee donald trump’s own trump foundation has such shady things going on. for shady example, his foundation has zero paid staff. the trump foundation has literally been laundering money under the guise of being a “charity” and the person profiting from it all is none-other-than republican presidential nominee donald trump. featured image via getty images      breaking: ‘washington post’ unloads trump tax fraud bomshell (details)      
__label__1 last night america finally got to see donald trump and hillary clinton together in the same room. and just as expected, there was some much pent up sparring. once the evening had concluded, it was evident who won that debate, no questions asked: hillary clinton. no one should be surprised. while the media has been speculating that viewers would once again see a âtrump pivot,â the facts remain the same â what we saw on the debate stage was the same trump we saw during the republican primaries â a brash, condescending, loudmouthed bully who has no plans, only talking points. all the pundits know it. the polls know it. the people know it. hillary clinton won because she was prepared, she was eloquent, and she kept her cool. but not surprisingly, trump and his band of surrogates didnât get the memo. they think they won. because why not? trump (and his people) say lester holt was unfair. they say the microphone was tampered with. they say hillary clinton was âtoo preparedâ so it was an unfair advantage. they say the media was too biased. excuse after excuse, trump refuses to take responsibility for his actions. he was unprepared, he was disrespectful, he couldnât elaborate, and he got personal. but enough about trump and his candy-ass excuses. letâs talk about why hillary clinton was clearly the winner. look no further than her best zinger of the night: âi think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. and, yes, i did. and you know what else i prepared for? i prepared to be president. and i think thatâs a good thing.â itâs been reported that clinton immersed herself with the issues of our times, poring over research, conducting rehearsals, and doing her homework. trump, on the other hand, was taking a casual, passive approach to the debates, and it showed. he couldnât elaborate, he didnât show decorum, and he didnât know how to respond to clintonâs assertions â except with lies. the bar was set pretty low due to trump. clinton knew she had to somewhat get on his level, but stay true to who she really ishis debate ended up being something special. she was up against a loud, bombastic, unpredictable bully who says whatever he pleases. luckily for her, she didnât take any of his lies personally. she fact checked him when holt wouldnât. she smiled politely as he sunk into the abyss with his never ending rambles. she wasnât âtoo loudâ as the pundits like to call it, but she was forceful when need be. and, even though itâs a stupid assessment (but somehow matters), she smiled. one of the reasons people hate debates is because they find that the moderators donât do their jobs. they allow the candidates to walk all over them, they go over their allotted time, they interrupt each other. it gets annoying. luckily, trump was in stark contrast to hillary clinton. she listened to holt when he told her that her time was up, and rarely interrupted holt to attack trump. while trump interrupted clinton 51 times, she interrupted trump only 17 times. at the end, clinton shook holtâs hand, and trump did not. while trumpâs famous âcrooked hillaryâ was front and center on snapchat, the facts paint a different story. npr, the non-partisan gold standard of whatâs left of journalism, did an in-depth fact check analysis and showed that, surprise, trump lied way more than clinton, while clintonâs claims were mostly upheld as true. while donald trump painted america as third world, crime-riddled hellhole, clinton offered us a hopeful, inspiring message of bringing back jobs, fixing broken race relations, and investigating in future generations. her plan would create 10 million jobs â his would cut 3.5 million. she wants to curb gun violence against black youth by holding them and communities (yes, that includes police officers) accountable. trump wants to implement the unconstitutional and ineffective stop and frisk. surprisingly, the agreed on several issues, such as the no-fly gun ban, opposition to the tpp, and a need to bring jobs back from overseas. but simply put, her way, not âtrumped up trickle down,â will get us there. this is why clinton won. she was the stronger candidate, and she shined while everyone was hoping it would be the other way around.â trump devolved into his classic self as she increasingly got under his skin. no, it wasnât holtâs fault. no, it wasnât the microphoneâs fault. no, it wasnât hillaryâs fault. it was trumpâs fault, plain and simple. maybe heâll take preparation a little more seriously for next time. or maybe not. it is trump, after all.       enough excuses: five ways hillary won the debate hands down      
__label__1 following the presidential debate, donald trump campaign spokeswoman katrina pierson opened her mouth on cbs and stupidity just flowed out of it. pierson was on the show to discuss donald trump’s debate performance on monday. when trump wasn’t sniffling, he was interrupting hillary clinton. naturally, pierson blamed hillary clinton for donald trump touting the stop-and-frisk policy, which by the way, was ruled unconstitutional in 2013. during the post-debate panel, pierson was asked to comment on donald trump’s recent proposal to get more cities to adopt the kind of stop-and-frisk policy in new york that was found unconstitutional back in 2013. as a shock to no one ever, rudy giuliani, a huge trump supporter, is and was a proponent of the racist policy. pierson took another route and blamed clinton, because of course: “in responding, pierson said that stop-and-frisk was effective at stopping crime and was not really racist — but then she blamed hillary clinton for stop-and-frisk being necessary because of her own racism.” “it actually did work in new york,” pierson said of the stop-and-frisk policy. “but we have to get down to why, because that’s why we’re here today. we have two candidates who have very different views. the reason why we have this problem, the reason why stop-and-frisk was implemented, was there were disparities with regard to who people were pulling over,” she continued. she went on to say: “and it’s profiling, criminal profiling, not necessarily racial profiling, even though it comes across that way. but the reason why we had it was that we had the first lady of the united states who went out on the national stage and dehumanized young black children… this has been the conditioning of the american public where black children have been demonized, hillary clinton owns that.” watch:  in late august, trump tweeted, “how quickly people forget that crooked hillary called african-american youth “super predators” – has she apologized?” yes, hillary clinton made the “super predators” remark more than 20 years ago, but it was not directed toward african-american children. this is nothing new for pierson. just last month, she blamed president obama for iraq war deaths in 2004.       katrina pierson just blamed hillary clinton for trump’s stop-and-frisk plan (video)      
__label__1 former new york city mayor rudy giuliani decided to weigh in on future president hillary clintonâs ability to perform as president in a worse way than trumpâs âstaminaâ remarks at the first presidential debate. according to giuliani, the fact that clinton is strong enough and loves her husband enough to make things work after he was unfaithful to her is actually a sign of weakness that disqualifies her from being president just as much as that one time she coughed and her almost superhuman ability to work hardâ and power through pneumonia for days before she finally collapses from the unnatural amount of strain she put on her body. âthe president of the united states, her husband, disgraced this country with what he did in the oval office and she didnât just stand by him, she attacked monica lewinsky,â giuliani said following mondayâs debate. âand after being married to bill clinton for 20 years, if you didnât know the moment monica lewinsky said that bill clinton violated her that she was telling the truth, then youâre too stupid to be president.â bill clinton didnât actually âviolateâ anybody. he fooled around with a woman, who was an adult and consented to everything they did, behind his wifeâs back. while she certainly had the right to be angry, and americans absolutely have the right to criticize him (he was wrong, but it didnât affect his ability to run the country), to say that she is a weak person for staying with him is absolute bullsh*t. clintonâs strength is in her ability to forgive, to think of the bigger picture, to make her marriage work in spite of a very, very public affair. of course, this is the sort of thinking that can be expected from a guy who was mayor when the planes hit the twin towers on september 11, 2001, yet recently completely forgot about those attacks while he was criticizing president obama, who paraded his mistress around for all to see, and who told the media he was divorcing his wife before he informedâ her or theirâ children. âunder those eight years, before obama came along, we didnât have any successful radical islamic terrorist attack inside the united states,â giulianiâ said in a speech in youngstown, ohio earlier lastâ month.â âthey all started when clinton and obama got into office.â watch it below: https://twitter.com/asvokos/status/780619672760623104/video/1       guy who forgot 9/11 happened says hillary is âtoo stupidâ to be president because she stayed with bill      
__label__1 mexicoâs former president, vicente fox, isnât shy at all about his disdain for republican nominee donald trump â and he really turned things up a notch after last nightâs presidential debate. anyone who watched the debate (or has access to the internet) knows by now that trump blew it. his performance was so weak and he was so unprepared, even republican pundits have admitted that democratic nominee hillary clinton won by a landslide â and fox wasnât afraid to point this out. on tuesday, fox decided to go after trump while itâs going to hurt the most, knowing full well that the business mogulâs ego is likely suffering from embarrassment. on twitter, fox teased trump mercilessly for his horrendous performance, directly asking trump âwhat does losing feel like?â on twitter. to rub this in even more, fox posted a screenshot of one of trumpâs pathetic fundraising emails, proving to the world that trumpâs campaign is still struggling and begging for money: [email protected] you have no shame, i just got another e-mail begging for help. tell me what does losing feels like? have a little dignity!â @realdonaldtrump you have no shame, i just got another e-mail begging for help. tell me what does losing feels like? have a little dignity! pic.twitter.com/avrv9wkg9t â vicente fox quesada (@vicentefoxque) september 27, 2016  continuing to pourâ salt into the wound, fox also praised clinton for showing âcapacity, compassion and wisdomâ while bashing trump for looking âafoul.â the attack was brutal: twitter twitter itâs been awhile since fox has been in the media for attacking trump, but he sure knows how to make an appearance. this election cycle, the former president of mexico has repeatedly made headlines for slamming trump and publicly stating that mexico willâ not pay for hisâ âf*cking wall.ââ fox has also said that trump âreminds me of hitlerâ and even challenged trump to a debate once (which trump was too cowardly to accept). we can only expect that over the next few weeks, fox is going to support clinton to the fullest, and do whatever he can to convince americans not to vote for trump.       mexicoâs former president unleashes brutal insults on trump after debate (tweets)      
__label__1 allow me to begin by saying former dnc chair howard dean is the f*ckingâ . after tweeting that donald trump might be on cocaine â a reasonable observation based on the gopâs actions during the first presidential debate â he could have backed down under scrutiny. he could have caved and apologized. instead, he made his case. dean, a physician who is qualified to speculate â though in his own words not diagnose without examining trump in person â responded to criticism of his remarks on msnbc. âi donât make diagnosis on the television, itâs medically improper,â he told kate snow tuesday, a subtle jab at trump and his legion of fox news âdoctorsâ feverishly trying to diagnose clinton with every neurological disorder under the sun because she coughed that one time and contracted pneumonia the other. âbut i donât think this was a ridiculous idea. something funny was going on with trump last night.â something âridiculousâ was indeed going on. trump spent his evening screaming about ridiculous conspiracy theories, attacking his opponentâs âstaminaâ based on a minor illness, interrupting clinton constantly, guzzling water, sweating profusely, and other things that would be expected from his meth-addled twitter followers rather than a serious presidential candidate. âhereâs the interesting constellation: he sniffs during the presentation, which is something that users do. he also has grandiosity, which is something that accompanies that problem. he has delusions, iâm not talking about being crazy, but for example when he told everybody he was very smart not to pay taxes and then denied that he said after he said it it in front of 100 million people,â dean said. âhe thinks somehow heâs not going to get caught, that is delusional.â he has trouble with pressured speech,â the former vermont governor added. âhe interrupted, as you pointed out, hillary clinton twenty-nine times. he couldnât keep himself together.â âdo i think at 70 years old he has a cocaine habit? probably not,â dean concludes.â âbut itâs something that i think would be interesting to ask him, to see if he ever had a problem with that.â asked for clarification if he thinks trump has a âcocaine habit,â dean replied âi donât think he has a cocaineâ ,â placing special emphasis on the word âhabit.â in other words, it might be a stretch to say trump isâ  to cocaine, but it is possible that he used it to pep himself up before the debate. in an effort to deflect from the allegation, trump assured the public that he just had a cold, but stephen colbert put it best when he said the donald âsounded like he was trying to get over a cold using cocaine.â we canât know for sure if trump has ever been treated for addiction, as he refuses to release his records â and since trump should be held to the same standards to which he holds hillary clinton, itâs not unreasonable to question if he has been using cocaine (especially given the crazy, whacked-out bonkers stuff he says in public). watch dean slay this interview below:        howard dean just doubled down on trumpâs possible cocaine use (video)      
__label__1 the earliest actual poll to come out of last nightâs debate was a cnn/orc poll showing that 62 percent of respondents believed hillary had won the debate. however, there are a ton of polls that were conducted online that say trump won in a landslide. how can that be? hereâs to answer that question: are polls like this an accurate measure of how the electorate responded to mondayâs debate? â huffington post (@huffingtonpost) september 27, 2016  why is this obvious joke of a poll so damning for all the online polls claiming trump destroyed hillary? because this shows how online polls are meaningless. cnn actually contacted people. anybody and everybody can answer an online poll. the results generally skew heavily to one side or the other, depending on the outletâs usual audience and which organizations/social media channels post poll links. thereâs also the fact that trumpkins from both 4chan and reddit were stuffing last nightâs poll boxes, proving how easy it is to manipulate online polls. of course, the trumpkins arenât happy with at all for blowing those delusions out of the water: @huffingtonpost someoneâs upset that #trumpwins â jim (@jimbags12) september 27, 2016  @huffingtonpost are middle schoolers doing reporting for you guys? â timothy j. sims (@timothyjsims2) september 27, 2016  hope no one at clemson got triggered for seeing this racist tweet. @huffingtonpost pic.twitter.com/0kxxsnnmh5 â michael benson (@keymrb) september 27, 2016  @huffingtonpost please vote hillary or else bill clinton will do things to me ð¢ pic.twitter.com/csoon8nf3y â pneumonia warmachine (@z3no_of_citium) september 27, 2016  and, obviously, we can always count on trump himself to only tout the polls that say he won, because anything that doesnât show him as the winner, as the god he wants to be, is biased and unfair, and, well, who cares about those outlets anyway: i won every poll from last nights presidential debate â except for the little watched @cnn poll. â donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) september 27, 2016  the #1 trend on twitter right now is #trumpwon â thank you! â donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) september 27, 2016  such a great honor. final debate polls are in â and the movement wins!#americafirst #maga #imwithyouhttps://t.co/3kwol2ibaw pic.twitter.com/sfcee3i5pf â donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) september 27, 2016  he tweeted a story from the too, that carries a headline saying, âmajority of snap polls show trump won debate by a landslide despite cnnâs overwhelming victory for hillary in biggest official survey.â they actually looks like theyâre calling the results of the cnn poll into question with screencaps of every online poll in existence. self-selecting polls aside, the result is pretty damn clear. hillary won.       huffpo just dropped the mic on internet polls saying trump crushed hillary in last nightâs debate      
__label__1 if thereâs anyone in this day and age who most definitely doesnât mince words, and will say what needs to be said, itâs vice president joe biden. while speaking in philadelphia, pennsylvania on a campaign stop for hillary clinton, biden tore into some of the remarks from mondayâs debate. especially when donald trump seemed to think itâs perfectly fine to screw over the american people, or benefit from their sorrow. biden said: âthis is a guy who said â and wants to be president â that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. what in the hell is he talking about?â adding: âevery president i have served with, including republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an american, about what weâre supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.â then really getting to the core of it, he said: âhe does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every american politician left, right and center i know have. they disagree on how to make things better for you, but they donât take pleasure from âyouâre fired.â they donât take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.â biden also talked about how trump seems proud of not paying taxes. taxes that all of us have to pay and donât have the luxury of manipulating the tax code to our advantage. âhe acknowledged that he didnât pay taxes because, he said, heâs smart. makes him smart. tell that to the janitor in here whoâs paying taxes. tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. no i really mean it. it angers me.â biden knows, as we should all know by this point in the election, who the better choice is for commander-in-chief. he reiterates: âif this choice isnât clear, i donât know â- my lordâ¦ what bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the american people.â and itâs true, the choice is abundantly clear â hillary rodham clinton should and be our next president. watch biden lay into trump here: watch: vp biden goes off on trump over trumpâs comments about not paying taxes: âit angers me! â¦ what in the hell is he talking about!?â pic.twitter.com/qg5l5hcnvl â nbc nightly news (@nbcnightlynews) september 27, 2016        watch joe biden take trumpâs own words and tear him to shreds after debate (video)      
__label__1 during monday nightâs presidential debate, hillary clinton accused donald trump of screwing thousands of his workers out of the wages that they owe him. it was a shining moment for clinton, that highlighted how trumpâs entire fortune comes from not his business savvy, but his unending greed and eagerness to exploit anyone he can. before saying that she is glad that trump never did business with father, she directly told trump that he needed to apologize to all those he hurt, saying: âdo the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that theyâve produced and then refused to pay them?â one of those people that trump stiffed over is an architect named andrew tesoro. tesoro sat down for an interview on , where he revealed how trump did not pay him the $100,000 dollars that were owed to him for helping to a clubhouse at one of trumpâs many golf courses. tesoro was asked whether he was paid for the work he had done on the clubhouse. he responded by saying: âno, he didnât. he paid partially along the way and the project snowballed over a four year period and our role in the project snowballed as well. we became very much involved in interior design and construction stage work. we made many supplemental agreements as we went along and in the end those agreements were not honored.â because trump will do anything to distance himself from his fraudulent business practices, he recently asserted that tesoro probably wasnât paid because of shoddy work. that comment should really be biting him in the ass now. thatâs because tesoro revealed that trump had written him a letter of recommendation in 2006. in the letter, trump praised tesoro for his work. tesserâs experience is not unique. it seems like every day that more people are coming out in droves and exposing the various ways that trump has royally screwed them over. one report has been particularly damning. found that trump has been involved in over 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades. they also found that he has left everyone from cabinetmakers to carpenters left without being paid in full, or on time. while those numbers certainly make it easier to understand how far reaching trumpâs fraudulent practices are, hearing it from someone who was a victim of them makes it so much more real. you can watch tesoro expose trump for scam artist in his own words below.        fraud: architect who was scammed for $100k exposes the real trump (video)      
__label__0 washington (cnn) donald trump's debate study habits, hillary clinton's strategy on millennials and the latest electoral trends in swing state ohio -- they're just some of the future headlines in our "inside politics" forecast this week. 1. debate crunch time, and questions about trump's prep the first presidential debate is a week from monday, and donald trump has made time on his sunday schedule for prep sessions with senior advisers. but the unconventional nature of his candidacy extends to his study habits, and some on his team are a bit worried. maggie haberman of the new york times shared her reporting on trump's aversion to holding mock debate sessions, among other things. "he's playing it a little bit loose and in his sort of free-form style," said haberman. "but a lot of people around him are concerned that won't translate quite as well in a general election debate." 2. obama skipping clinton foundation event the clinton global initiative, an offshoot of the clinton foundation, will hold its annual -- and final -- gathering monday and tuesday in new york. it's held at the same time as the united nations general assembly for obvious reasons: major global leaders are in new york and can be sprinkled throughout the cgi sessions. but one big name will be missing from this cgi meeting. julie pace of the associated press notes that the clintons' initiative has come under fire this election year. "hillary clinton would be happy if she could get through the rest of the campaign without having to talk anymore about the foundation, but she's going to have to grin and bear it for a few more days," said pace. "this is a three-day gathering with lots of celebrities, lots of big donors -- but there's some speculation it might not be as glitzy as in past years. and there's going to be one very notable absence headlining this meetings, and that's president barack obama." 3. clinton targets millennials in ohio it's no secret hillary clinton has issues with younger voters, and she is looking to turn the tide. on monday, clinton will travel to ohio to make her case to millennials by retracing some of her early work as a lawyer. abby philip of the washington post says trying to get younger voters to relate more to clinton is the big goal. "the focus of the speech is going to be about her early years -- what she did after she left college -- the focus on idealism and reminding young voters that she was kind of like them," said phillip. "and also like someone else, a young community organizer from chicago, barack obama." will this humanize her? make her seem more like a real person and less like a politician? stay tuned. 4. signs of progress for trump in swing state ohio is always a giant presidential battleground, and the gop primary candidacy of its governor, john kasich, adds another interesting wrinkle this year. kasich is no donald trump fan -- far from it -- but some ohio republicans see signs that even former kasich primary voters are turning to trump in the general election. there's a lot of talk about the influx of newly registered republican voters and cnn's sara murray reports that gopers surveying those new party members in the buckeye state are finding firmer-than-expected trump support. "they're finding donald trump has strong support from democrats who are now republicans, independents who are now republicans," murray said. "people who registered to vote for john kasich in the primaries are now backing trump. and what should be particularly worrisome for democrats in ohio is that they (the gop) are finding far more support than they expected among female voters." 5. mixed ballots in ohio pose dilemma  suppose you're working a republican phone bank in ohio and a voter tells you they plan to vote for hillary clinton for president and republican rob portman for u.s. senate. do you take time -- and resources -- to follow up with that voter to make sure they cast their ballot? democrats privately concede that portman appears to be on an easy path to re-election, so it is less of a conflict for them. ohio is a tough state, and the clinton campaign will try to motivate every last potential voter to turn out, no matter who they support for the senate. but what about the republican party's ground-game efforts? ostensibly such efforts are on behalf of all republicans, but gop candidates who don't have the best relationship with trump don't all trust the rnc to fight on their behalf. so portman is relying on his own get-out-the-vote effort. those who have seen recent gop polling in the state say this is one good reason why: some 20% of clinton voters in ohio say they are planning to vote republican for senate.       trump's debate prep strategy      
__label__0 hillary clinton and donald trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight, and they did it with plenty of barbs. the two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at hofstra university in long island, new york, in front of what was expected to be a historic number of television viewers. here are 10 moments that mattered at the first general election presidential debate:        hillary clinton and donald trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months, but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on a genteel note, although the mutual contempt was just below the surface. when clinton walked out in a red pantsuit and trump in a blue tie -- the opponents’ trading traditional party colors -- the two shook hands and clinton said, “how are you, donald?” perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with a warm greeting. shortly after the debate began, trump talked about overseas trade deals, saying, “but in all fairness to secretary clinton,” before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying, “yes, is that ok? good. i want you to be very happy. it's very important to me.” he seemed to be referring to his addressing her as “secretary clinton,” although it wasn’t completely clear during the moment.  clinton was first to go on the attack during tonight’s debate, taking aim at trump’s business roots by claiming he borrowed $14 million from his father to start his real estate business. “donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. he started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. i don't buy that. i have a different experience,” clinton said, before expanding on her father’s work as a drapery maker. trump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in “trumped up, trickle-down” economics. “for one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and i built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,” trump said.  voters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the trans-pacific partnership trade deal. trump accused clinton of supporting tpp, the proposed trade agreement between the united states and 11 other countries along the pacific rim. “and now you want to approve trans-pacific partnership. you were totally in favor of it,” trump said. clinton fired back, “well, that is just not accurate. i was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.” trump then pointed to clinton’s once referring to tpp as the “gold standard of trade deals.” “well, donald, i know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,” clinton said. clinton promoted tpp as secretary of state under president obama, who is pushing the trade deal. while speaking in australia in november 15, 2012, clinton said, "tpp sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.” clinton came out against the trade deal october of last year, saying that “what i know about it as of today i am not in favor of what i have learned about it.”  less than 30 minutes into the debate, trump went after clinton, attacking her on trade, isis, taxes, the economy and more. clinton quipped: "i have a feeling by the end of this evening i'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.” trump didn’t miss a beat, saying to his opponent: “why not?” clinton responded: "why not? yeah. why not? just join the debate by saying more crazy things. now, let me say this—“ trump interjected: "there's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country,” before the moderator reminded trump, "this is secretary clinton's two minutes, please."    trump clashed with his democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returns. “i don't mind releasing. i'm under a routine audit and it will be released,” he said. trump went on to tout his disclosure of a different federally mandated form required by the u.s. office of government ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster general. trump then pivoted to attack clinton over her private email server. “i will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,” he said. “i think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. for 40 years, everyone running for president has release their tax returns,” she said. “you got to ask yourself: why won't he release his tax returns? “maybe he doesn't want the american people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes,” she said.  moderator lester holt asked trump “what took you so long” to acknowledge that president obama was born in the united states, bringing the republican nominee’s recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for years. at first, trump claimed that two clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into barack obama’s birth certificate during the 2008 campaign -- a claim that he has made before -- and then said that he was “satisfied” with when obama released his birth certificate. holt noted that obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011, but trump continued to raise questions about it’s authenticity until 2015. “nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,” trump said, referencing the years between the release and trump’s decision this month to acknowledge obama was born in america. “i figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. but nobody was caring much about it. but i was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and i think i did a good job.”    trump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said, “i’ve been all over the place. you decided to stay home and that's ok,” seeming to jab clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare for tonight’s faceoff. "i think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,” clinton said. "and, yes, i did. and you know what else i prepared for? i prepared to be president. and i think that's a good thing.” throughout the debate, clinton tried to portray trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency. she also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail: that she doesn't stump as much as he does because she doesn't have his endurance.  trump’s support of stop and frisk, a controversial tactic once heavily used by the new york police department, was discussed at length during the debate. “stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of new york city. tremendous beyond belief. so when you say it has no impact, it really did, it had a very very big impact,” trump said. trump said that the tactic was not deemed unconstitutional -- which it was -- and added instead that “it went before a judge who was a very against-police judge.” “they would have won an appeal,” he said, noting that there was no appeal. trump and clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like chicago and new york for nearly 10 minutes of the debate.  toward the end of the debate, holt corrected trump on whether he supported the war in iraq before it started. “i did not support the war in iraq,” trump said. "that is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly i think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.” holt corrected him, saying, “the record shows otherwise.” the only time trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to howard stern in 2002 and seemed to support the invasion. stern asked trump, “are you for invading iraq?" trump appeared to hesitate, responding, “yeah, i guess so. i wish the first time it was done correctly.” despite the attempt to correct him, trump continued to stress he was against the war, saying, “the record shows that i am right.”  holt asked trump about when he once said that clinton does not have a “presidential look,” asking trump what he meant by that. trump pivoted to attack her “stamina.” "she doesn't have the look, she doesn’t have the stamina,” trump said. "i said she doesn't have the stamina. and i don't believe she does have the stamina. to be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.” trump has been hitting clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months, but tonight clinton tried to shut that line of attack down. "well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina,” clinton said. she also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about women: "one thing lester, he tried to switch from looks to stamina,” clinton said. "but this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs. and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers. who has said women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.”      10 moments that mattered from hillary clinton and donald trump's first debate      
__label__0 hillary clinton used the first presidential debate of the general-election season to launch a full frontal attack on donald trump, baiting him into fights over his personal finances, taxes, sexism, race relations, business dealings and personal honesty. if clinton came looking for a fight, she found it. her aggressive tone drew trump in. he attacked clinton right back, showing flashes of anger that channeled public frustration and also the coarser side of his public persona. it made for some lively exchanges, including several that brought an edge to trump’s tone. “she doesn’t have the look,” trump said toward the end of the debate. “she doesn’t have the stamina.” trump appeared rattled at times, particularly as the debate wore on. yet his main attacks on clinton were rooted in policy grounds, as he sought to give voice to public anger not just at clinton but at the broader political class. “you’ve been doing this for 30 years — why are you just thinking about these solutions now?” trump said in a section of the debate about ways to create jobs. “i have thought about this quite a bit,” clinton countered. “yeah, for 30 years,” trump responded. trump stretched facts and attacked clinton’s temperament. he — for the most part — kept his cool.       throughout the debate, clinton called trump “donald.” he almost always referred to her as “secretary clinton” and made sure that was all right with her. “i want you to be very happy. it’s very important to me,” trump said, challenging the fact-checkers once again. trump was brought onto his shakiest ground of the night when moderator lester holt brought up president barack obama’s birthplace — specifically why it took trump until just weeks ago to declare the matter settled. trump flatly said, “i say nothing” to those who wonder why he pushed the matter as long as he did. and he falsely accused clinton of starting the birther question in 2007, claiming credit for putting the issue to rest. “just like she can’t bring back jobs, she can’t produce” obama’s birth certificate, trump said. clinton pounced on an issue with resonance among black voters and other parts of the obama coalition. “it can’t be dismissed that easily. he has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an american citizen,” she said. “the birther lie was a very hurtful one.” apparently worried that trump would be on his best behavior, clinton started her barrage early. she suggested that trump’s success is inherited, and that he’s hiding his tax returns to avoid embarrassment. “maybe he’s not as rich as he says he is,” she said. “maybe he’s not as charitable as he claims to be.” trump didn’t even bother to deny clinton’s suggestion that he hasn’t paid income taxes “for a lot of years,” turning even that into an argument against the status quo. “it would be squandered too, believe me,” trump said. clinton also found a groove in attacking trump on iraq. trump again insisted that he was against the iraq war before it started, a statement for which there is no public record in support of his claim. for his part, trump took clinton on consistently, attacking her on jobs, trade and national security, using her as a stand-in for politicians in general. “i have a feeling that by the end of this evening, i’m going to be blamed for everything that ever happened,” clinton said at one point. trump: “why not?” clinton: “just join the debate by saying more crazy things.” clinton had one of her better moments in declaring her fitness for office, keying off of trump’s criticism of her for retreating from the campaign trail. “donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. and yes, i did,” she said. “and you know what else i prepared for? i prepared to be president. and i think that’s a good thing.” later in the debate, trump allowed that clinton has experience, “but it’s bad experience,” he said. “this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience,” trump said. after the first extraordinary encounter between two extraordinarily unpopular nominees, the plays are clear. clinton is putting her experience up against the anger trump is channeling, anger that has two distinct sides to it. they proved they can get under each other’s skin. but neither candidate proved that he or she has a winning message, not on the night of the first debate.      analysis: hillary clinton baits donald trump into fight, and he more than counters      
__label__0 as the first presidential debate was drawing to a close, hillary clinton took one last chance to hammer donald trump, hitting at his remarks on women. “this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,” clinton said fervently from the debate stage tonight. “and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.” the democratic presidential nominee brought up former miss universe alicia machado, who has said that trump regularly bullied her when he took over the pageant in 1996, allegedly calling the venezuelan beauty contestant “miss piggy” and “miss housekeeping.”   “and one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. he loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them,” clinton said. “and he called this woman ‘miss piggy.’ then he called her ‘miss housekeeping,’ because she was latina. donald, she has a name. her name is alicia machado.” machado has since become an american citizen and has vowed to vote for clinton, according to her instagram.     the presidential hopefuls clashed over trump’s remarks on women when "nbc nightly news" anchor and debate moderator lester holt asked the republican nominee to clarify controversial comments he made earlier that clinton doesn’t have “a presidential look.” trump said that by “look,” he meant “stamina.” “she doesn't have the look, she doesn’t have the stamina,” trump said from the stage at hofstra university in hempstead, new york. "to be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina." clinton soon chimed in, “one thing lester, he tried to switch from looks to stamina.” while trump denied some of clinton’s allegations about his comments on women, he defended his harsh words for actor rosie o’donnell at tonight’s debate. “rosie o'donnell, i said very tough things to her, and i think everybody would agree she deserves it, and nobody feels sorry for her,” trump said.    back in august 2015 during the first gop primary debate, fox news host and debate moderator megyn kelly confronted trump about using words like “fat pigs,” “dogs,” “slobs” and “disgusting animals” to describe some women. trump interjected and said, “only rosie o’donnell.” abc news' nicole phillip, maggie mcnish and sunny choo contributed to this report.      hillary clinton slams donald trump for calling women 'pigs, slobs and dogs'      
__label__0 donald trump pushed back against criticism he received from hillary clinton during last night's debate regarding his treatment of former miss universe alicia machado, saying "she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem." trump made his remarks on "fox and friends" this morning in response to clinton's pointing out that trump called machado "miss piggy" and blasting the republican nominee's overall treatment of women. "she was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem," trump said of machado. "we had a real problem. not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her." trump spoke about machado's appearance today while answering a question about whether clinton had gotten under his skin. he said she hadn't, and he went on to compare machado with other miss universes, describing her as "the worst we ever had."    machado, representing venezuela, won miss universe in 1996 when she was 19 years old. she gained weight after the competition and accused trump of humiliating her over her appearance shortly thereafter. after her reign as miss universe, she acted in international soap operas and had a brief stint promoting a weight loss product. she appeared in a 2006 edition of mexican playboy. she became a u.s. citizen in may of 2016 and has become a supporter of clinton. "donald, she has a name. her name is alicia machado," clinton said last night. "and she has become a u.s. citizen, and you can bet she is going to vote this november." trump later told a gaggle of reporters that he was proud that he did not bring up former president bill clinton's history of infidelity. “i'm very happy that i was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to bill clinton," trump said. “because i have a lot of respect for chelsea clinton, and i just didn't want to say what i was going to say."      trump on former miss universe machado: 'she gained a massive amount of weight'      
__label__0 monday night was donald trump's introduction to the general-election debate stage. on display was the republican presidential nominee as a dichotomy; there was the, albeit briefly, measured trump who forwent his usual “crooked hillary” for “secretary clinton” as he addressed his democratic rival. and, defying expectations, he did not address her husband's marital indiscretions, later saying he abstained out of respect for chelsea clinton, who was in the room. in his second form, the businessman displayed his usual bombast and penchant for attacks, showcasing style perhaps over substance. members of his campaign team were trying to lower debate expectations of trump, leaking to reporters that he was shunning policy briefings and not standing at faux lecterns for 90 minutes at a time in preparation. they instead praised his freewheeling style and confidence and criticized hillary clinton for being overly prepared. "i thought my prep was very good. i think my prep was very good. and i really enjoyed it," trump told abc news' tom llamas last night. trump, while forceful in his attacks, appeared to miss key opportunities to contrast himself with his opponent. during the 90-minute debate, trump never mentioned the 2012 attacks in benghazi, even after clinton invoked libya and his comments about her private email server were sparse. such attacks on key issues are typically practiced during debate prep sessions; according to his advisers, trump never participated in a mock debate. during a phone interview this morning on "fox & friends," the hosts asked trump if he had any regrets about his performance. "do you regret not bringing up the emails as much? you brought it up at one point," host ainsley earhardt asked. she followed up by asking why he did not expand his attacks on clinton's email server or the clinton foundation. "i would have liked to have done that," trump responded. "but the question weren't — i mean, don't forget you are asked a question as to progress or something, and it's hard to get off to benghazi sometimes the way the questions were framed. you know, you start off open a totally — the opposite of benghazi, and so benghazi can't get brought up, but it was a very interesting evening. i thought it was good." he landed blistering attacks on clinton on trade, one of his signature issues, effectively highlighting her weaknesses in supporting, then denouncing the trans-pacific partnership. but he seemed to falter when questioned about his past actions. when asked what took him so long to accept the fact that president barack obama was born in the country, trump reverted to the lie that the clinton campaign pushed the birther issue before the democratic primaries eight years ago. trump's answer to the question caused some voters to lower their approval rating of him, according to a focus group hosted by veteran pollster frank luntz. "i was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and i think i did a good job," trump said during the debate. in another misstep, he admitted during a heated exchange with clinton on tax returns that he did not pay federal taxes. "maybe he doesn't want the american people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes," clinton said. "because the only years that anybody has ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax." "that makes me smart," he retorted. but trump, ever the showman, delivered several quick-witted exchanges that elicited laughter from the audience. "now, in all fairness to secretary clinton, yes, is that ok?" he asked, looking her for approval. as she nodded, he added, "good. i want you to be very happy. it's very important to me."      donald trump and the perils of little preparation      
__label__0 donald trump ended one of the sharpest exchanges in last night's debate against hillary clinton with a pointed question: "why did she delete 33,000 emails?" clinton is doing her best to move beyond the controversy over her use of a private email server as secretary of state, saying only last night that she "made a mistake" and declining to address why those emails were deleted. she didn't answer trump's questions. however, there is an answer. the bottom line: clinton believed the deleted emails were not work-related.     in late 2014, the state department asked clinton and other former secretaries of state to hand over any work-related emails they may have. by then, clinton had already "deleted some [emails] over time as an ordinary user would," fbi director james comey told lawmakers at a july congressional hearing. and she tasked her legal team to determine which of the roughly 60,000 emails still on her server were work-related. "clinton told the fbi that she directed her legal team to provide any work-related or arguably work-related emails to state; however she did not participate in the development of the specific process to be used or in discussions of the locations of where her emails might exist," the fbi concluded in its investigative summary of the case. comey testified that the fbi "didn't find any evidence of evil intent and intent to obstruct justice." to determine which emails were work-related, a member of clinton’s legal team did four things: she automatically deemed any email sent from or to a .gov and .mil address as related to work; she searched the tens of thousands of emails for names of senior state department officials, lawmakers, foreign leaders and other government officials; she conducted a keyword search for work-related terms; and she looked at the sender, recipient and "subject" of every email for other potentially work-related emails, but she did not read the contents of those emails. in december 2014, clinton’s legal team provided about 30,000 emails -- totaling 55,000 pages -- to the state department. "[clinton] then was asked by her lawyers at the end, 'do you want us to keep the personal emails?' and she said, 'i have no use for them anymore.' it's then that they issued the direction that the technical people delete them," comey told lawmakers. in total, more than 30,000 emails were deleted "because they were personal and private about matters that i believed were within the scope of my personal privacy," clinton told reporters in march of 2015, as the controversy around her private emails was growing. "they had nothing to do with work," clinton added. "i didn't see any reason to keep them ... no one wants their personal emails made public, and i think most people understand that and respect that privacy." clinton said her team "went through a thorough process" to identify work-related emails, and she said he had "absolute confidence that everything that could be in any way connected to work is now in the possession of the state department." however, after a year-long investigation, the fbi recovered more than 17,000 emails that had been deleted or otherwise not turned over to the state department, and many of them were work-related, the fbi has said. republican critics have accused clinton of using a private server and ultimately deleting emails to skirt federal records laws aimed at promoting transparency, and earlier this month the chairman of the house oversight and government reform committee, jason chaffetz, r-utah, said, "the sequence of events leading up to the destruction of secretary clinton’s emails ... raises questions about whether secretary clinton, acting through her attorneys, instructed [aides and others] to destroy records relevant to" a congressional investigation of the deadly benghazi attack. at the july hearing before chaffetz's committee, rep. jim jordan, r-ohio, asked comey, "did secretary clinton know her legal team deleted those emails that they kept from [congress]?" "i don't believe so," comey responded. during monday night's debate, trump promised to release his tax returns "when she releases her 33,000 emails that have been deleted," adding that he would "go against" the advice of his lawyers "if she releases her emails." moderator lester holt then asked trump if that meant releasing his tax returns was negotiable. trump responded: "it's not negotiable. no, let her release her emails. why did she delete 33,000 emails?"      why hillary clinton deleted 33,000 emails on her private email server      
__label__0 hillary clinton came out swinging against donald trump today after the first presidential debate of the general-election season, criticizing his post-performance gripes, questioning his wealth and suggesting a "strong probability" the gop nominee has not paid federal income taxes in years. "he actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes," clinton said while campaigning in north carolina today, referring to an exchange from monday night's debate. "in fact, i think there's a strong probability he hasn't paid federal taxes a lot of years." she added, "when i confronted him with the reasons why he won't release his tax returns and i got to that point where i said, 'well, maybe he's paid zero,' he said that makes him smart. now, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make all the rest of us?" clinton, who took several days off the campaign trail to prepare for the candidates' first face-off, also said her opponent was ill-prepared. "he made it very clear that he didn't prepare for that debate," she told the crowd of roughly 1,400. "at one point he was kind of digging me for spending time off the campaign trail to get prepared. but just trying to keep track of everything he says took a lot of time and effort." trump called in to "fox & friends" this morning, at one point saying he thought he had microphone issues during monday night's debate. but he later said it must have been working well enough to pick up his breathing when it sounded as if he was sniffling. clinton reacted this morning aboard her campaign plane, saying, "anyone who complains about the microphone is not having a good night." asked by reporters whether she thinks trump will skip the remaining two debates next month — as he and some of his surrogates have suggested — she said she'll be there, no matter what. "well, i'm going to show up. he gets to decide what he's going to do," clinton said. "but i will be there in st. louis and then after that in las vegas. she added, "if i'm the only person onstage, well, you know, i'm the only person onstage." at her campaign event in raleigh, north carolina, today clinton took a veiled swipe at trump's wealth. "one of my guests was mark cuban," clinton said, referring to him as "a real billionaire."      hillary clinton pans donald trump's 1st debate performance: 'he made it very clear that he didn't prepare'      
__label__0 donald trump and his team are slamming presidential debate moderator lester holt for not asking hillary clinton questions monday night about her email controversy and possible conflicts of interest concerning the clinton foundation, among other things. “he didn’t ask her about the emails at all,” trump told “fox &friends” this morning. “he didn’t ask her about her scandals. he didn’t ask her about the benghazi [libya] deal that she destroyed. he didn’t ask her about a lot of things that she should have been asked about. there’s no question about it.” trump also said holt, the anchor of nbc’s “nightly news,” leaned “more than a little” to the left. “lester should have brought up the emails,” trump said when asked why he thought holt didn’t stress the private server controversy. “that should have been a question.” trump gave holt a “c” or “c plus” when asked to grade his performance. “i thought he was ok,” trump said. “i thought he was fine. nothing outstanding. i thought he gave me very unfair questions at the end, the last three, four questions. but i’m not complaining about that. i thought he was ok.” vice presidential candidate mike pence also criticized holt’s questioning during the debate. “i was disappointed that lester did not get into some of the issues that have been so much in the forefront of hillary clinton’s candidacy,” pence said on abc news’ “good morning america” today. “the fbi investigation, clinton foundation, pay to play, the whole disastrous events that took place in benghazi and libya — that never came up.” but top clinton aide john podesta said the trump camp should stop criticizing the questions. “look, we have a kind of rule in our campaign: when you are complaining about the moderator, you are losing,” he said on fox this morning. “i think that the trump side shouldn’t do it either,” he added. “i think on, balance, it was fair.” top trump supporter rudy giuliani also hit holt this morning for saying monday night that the stop-and-frisk policing tactic was unconstitutional. “i watched lester holt do candy crowley at least twice,” said giuliani, a former mayor of new york, referring to her controversial fact-check of mitt romney during a 2012 presidential debate. “the moderator didn’t do his homework, and the moderator is wrong about [stop and frisk],” giuliani said today on “fox & friends.” “a hundred million people last night were misled by lester holt.” in fact, a federal judge ruled stop and frisk unconstitutional in 2013, and the city later dropped its appeal of the ruling. giuliani said monday night that if he were trump, he would consider skipping the remaining two debates because of what he called unfair moderating.      donald trump and surrogates heap blame on debate moderator lester holt's line of questioning      
__label__0 during a campaign stop in philadelphia, vice president joe biden slammed donald trump’s debate performance monday night –- specifically taking umbrage with the gop nominee's comments on the housing crisis. "this is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. what in the hell is he talking about?" biden said during a rally at drexel university. "every president i have served with, including republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an american, about what we’re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are." biden asked the crowd if they could imagine ronald reagan, "saying it's good business to take advantage of people’s misery, rooting for that misery?" "he does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every american politician left, right and center i know have," biden said. "they disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don’t take pleasure from 'you’re fired.' they don’t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit." during the first presidential debate, hillary clinton said trump was rooting for a collapse in the housing market, to which the real-estate mogul responded, "that's called business, by the way." "when you’re sitting atop trump tower, in a semi-golden palace, not a joke, what do you care about the people that i grew up with?" biden said of trump. the vice president also criticized trump's suggestion that not paying taxes "makes me smart." "he acknowledged that he didn’t pay taxes because, he said, he’s smart. makes him smart," biden said. "tell that to the janitor in here who’s paying taxes. tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. no i really mean it. it angers me.” he added that the views trump expressed in the debate demonstrate his outlook on the country. "if this choice isn’t clear, i don’t know –- my lord," biden said about the debate.

__label__0 peaceful protesters crowded charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of keith lamont scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence. but none of them stood out monday quite as much as a young girl. zianna oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears streaking her face, brought into focus the stress police shootings place on children, as well as the pain the black community of charlotte has suffered in the wake of scott's death last week. “i’ve been born and raised in charlotte. and i never felt this way until now and i can’t stand how we’re treated,” the grade-school girl said, wiping away tears.   she expressed the hardship that children face when a parent dies. scott himself, who was african-american, had seven children. “it’s a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. and we have tears. we shouldn’t have tears. we need our fathers and mothers to be by our side,” she said. zianna, as well as the protesters in the room who chanted "no justice, no peace" after she spoke, helped to underscore the degree to which communal wounds have been slow to heal in north carolina’s most populous city since the shooting. protests started on the streets of charlotte after news of scott's shooting broke last tuesday and, occasionally, became violent as they continued deeper into the week.   the scene grew especially tense wednesday night when police clad in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators. some people in the crowds threw bottles and rocks at officers and passing cars, blocked an interstate highway, surrounded and jumped on vehicles, looted businesses and stormed the entrance of a hyatt hotel, injuring two of its employees. at the city council meeting, charlotte mayor jennifer roberts called for decorum at several points during public remarks. at several points, protesters yelled criticism of her and police chief kerr putney. after the meeting wrapped up, the charlotte observer reported, more than 20 protesters moved to the lobby of the government center. “release. release. the whole damn tape,” the protesters chanted, according to the newspaper.   ray dotch, scott's brother-in-law, monday called for the release of the entire video of his shooting in an interview with abc news. chief putney has released body and dashboard camera videos of the fatal police shooting of scott, answering to demands made by community leaders, protesters and politicians. but it is not entirely clear from those videos or from the one taken by scott's wife, rakeiya scott, that the victim had a gun on his person, as the police allege. it is also not entirely clear that he brandished it in such a way that would have posed a threat to the officers who approached him.      young girl's emotional council speech laments 'shame' of fatal charlotte shooting      
__label__0 on wednesday, the senate is expected to override president obama's veto, for the first time, on a bill that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue saudi arabia. so how exactly does a veto override work? the rules are described in article 1, section 7 of the constitution. when the president rejects a bill, he is required to return it, along with his objections, to the chamber in which the bill originated. then, the members of that chamber "shall enter the objections at large on their journal, and proceed to reconsider it." in other words, the president sends vetoed senate bills back to the senate to reconsider first and vetoed house bills back to the house to reconsider first. in this case, the justice against sponsors of terrorism act, or jasta, began in the senate, so the senate votes first. both the house and the senate require a two-thirds majority to successfully override a president's veto. both chambers also require the "yeas and nays" to be counted. in the house, the members vote using the electronic voting system and in the senate they take a roll call vote, in which each senator’s name is called by the clerk. though the senate received president obama’s veto message on friday, they’re not voting on it until wednesday. this is common, according to the congressional research service, because it gives senators time to work out the terms under which they will reconsider the vetoed bill, including the amount of debate time on the senate floor. then, when the vetoed bill comes up for a vote, the presiding officer of that chamber states, "shall the bill pass, the objections of the president of the united states to the contrary notwithstanding?" while some senate democrats and republicans have concerns that the jasta bill would open the united states up to similar legal retaliation from other foreign nations and tarnish its relationship with saudi arabia, a key middle east ally, the veto override is expected to easily garner the two-thirds votes needed to pass. assuming it clears the senate, the jasta veto override will then head to the house, where the same voting process will ensue. if the veto override is successful in the house and the senate, the bill will become law because two-thirds of both chambers have agreed to pass the bill despite the president's objection.      how congress can override president obama's veto of the 9/11 bill      
__label__0 nate smith, executive director of the texas nationalist movement, looked uncertain as a man identifying himself as an east ukrainian resistance fighter pledged solidarity to smith’s struggle for an independent texas. standing in a conference room in the ritz hotel in central moscow on sunday, smith nodded noncommittally and handed over his business card. it wasn’t the only incongruous encounter taking place at the ritz at what has been dubbed moscow’s international conference of separatists, an eclectic kremlin-funded gathering of organizations and sometimes wacky individuals pressing for self-rule for often unlikely territories. amidst the heavy glitz of the hotel, catalonian separatists and dissident irish republicans listened politely to presentations from east ukrainian rebels, azerbaijani minorities and the thoughts of the self-proclaimed "king of hawaii," who called in via video link. and among the few dozen activists comparing ideas for how to achieve self-determination, were two americans campaigning for texan and californian secession from the united states. the conference, now in its second year, is funded largely by the kremlin and organized by the anti-globalization movement of russia, a group that closely follows government positions. the movement says it is unconnected to the kremlin, but the hotel conference was almost entirely paid for by a charitable fund founded by president vladimir putin, which provided close to $546,000 for the project, according to public records. the attendees, including the texan delegate, had been offered free flights and accommodation. the conference’s organizers present it as a platform for marginalized groups, but its agenda overlaps with kremlin efforts to promote russia as an alternative guardian for global order, at the head of democratic movement opposed to alleged american imperialism.     “our main goal is to create a multi-polar world,” the conference’s creator, aleksander v. ionov, told its participants. “our president, vladimir vladimirovich putin, is probably the main anti-globalist in the world.” ionov himself, a relatively little-known businessman, has repeatedly met syrian president bashar al-assad, whom russia is backing militarily, saying the two discussed humanitarian aid and media activities two weeks ago. ionov’s conference plays into moscow’s own long-time policy of backing separatists in its former soviet neighbors. while jailing and harassing separatist groups at home, moscow has leveraged them abroad a pretext for military intervention, most recently fomenting the violent secessionist conflict in eastern ukraine. a sizable presence of pro-russian rebel supporters was visible on sunday, while not a single russian separatist group took part. all that and the anti-american flavor sometimes made uncomfortable listening for the groups less used to the atmosphere in the kremlin’s orbit. “it’s kind of awkward i guess,” smith said after one 30-minute denunciation of american inequity.   smith’s group, the texas nationalist movement, is campaigning for a referendum on whether texas should exit the united states. founded over 10 years ago, the group attracted some attention recently when it came within two votes of forcing the texas state gop to bring a debate on a secession referendum to the floor of the republican convention. smith said he was grateful for the chance to promote his campaign and was eager to clarify his attendance did not mean he was aligning with the kremlin. “we’re here to have a dialogue. we’re not in agreement with all the groups that are here,” smith said. “we’re here for very specific reasons. we came here to make a statement on behalf of the people of texas.” it was a sentiment echoed by louis j. marinelli from the yes california independence campaign, there to get his message out about his plan to make the golden state a nation. “we want to draw attention to our campaign,” marinelli said. “we’re not signing an alliance with russia or anything like that." the two secessionists’ urge for independence stems largely from a distaste with american foreign policy and a sense the u.s. has become dysfunctional. a gentle-mannered it consultant married to a russian, marinelli is aiming for a secession referendum by 2019. “the u.s. government is so dysfunctional it can’t be repaired from within anymore, and if we were a separate nation running our own affairs, we could improve the quality of life for californians,” marinelli said. both men were hoping for a donald trump victory in the u.s. presidential elections, banking on a surge in people looking to detach themselves from america. the u.k.'s recent "brexit" vote to leave the european union had also heartened many attendees. but why exactly the kremlin had decided to pay to gather them in moscow, few among the foreign attendees could say. nor did they appear particularly interested. “i’m not here to make presumptions about potential reasons for this conference,” smith said. however, the conference -- and its location in one of moscow’s expensive hotels, within shouting distance of the kremlin walls -- slots into a recognizable recent russian strategy. russia has been backing far right political parties in the west, in particular, reportedly funding france’s anti-european union party, the front national, with a $10 million loan. the practice echoes that of the soviet union, which secretly supported radical fringe groups around the world, but now coupled with elaborate disinformation campaigns from state media outlets. “it’s a school-book case,” said peter kreko, a fulbright visiting professor at indiana university who has studied russia’s use of the far right. “the simple reason is that russia is interested in dividing the western world. the strategy is not to create new divisions but to take the most from divisions already there.” kreko said the idea was to back groups hindering european integration and to undermine faith in western-style liberal democracy. “the tool-kit is pretty much the same as in the soviet union. any kind of movements that can cause chaos,” kreko said, adding he thought the conference was also a prop for domestic propaganda that state media would use to paint russia as a champion of democracy. few of the conference attendees were concerned they might become kremlin pawns, seeing it simply as a way to get their message out. “everybody’s using everybody,” marinelli said. “we’re using this conference for our own purposes. we want the attention so that we can get the word out, they want ..." he trailed off before finishing. “everybody’s got their own agenda, right? so, that’s just the way it is.” for most of the attendees the main pull appeared to be the guaranteed presence of the media, attracted by the conference’s oddity. “i’ve talked to seven media [organizations] today. i've got to get my story out,” said diarmuid mac dubhglais, international secretary for republican sinn féin, a tiny irish republican splinter group that supports the violent removal of british control over northern ireland. in any case, mac dubhglais said, he wouldn’t let “vladimir himself” impose ideas on him. “i’m not going to start passing out propaganda when i go home and start marching soviet-style," he said. besides, he said, perhaps the russian motive was altruistic. “maybe in fairness, they might think the cause is just,” he said then paused, before adding: “i’m hoping that’s what they think."      texas, california separatists attend kremlin-funded

__label__0 when donald trump was asked by debate moderator lester holt last night how he would prevent cyberattacks against the united states, the republican nominee had an opportunity to hammer hillary clinton on her use of a private email server and her handling of classified information as secretary of state. instead, trump suggested that a 400-pound hacker could have targeted the democratic national committee, accused democratic officials of mistreating sen. bernie sanders’ presidential campaign and praised his 10-year-old son’s “unbelievable” knack for computers.     the exchange was one of several missed opportunities for trump in monday’s presidential debate, according to congressional republicans who tuned in to the much-anticipated matchup. “i wish trump would’ve hit some of the softballs a little harder,” said rep. dave brat, r-va., who watched the debate with colleagues. republicans expressed frustration that holt did not ask any questions about the clinton foundation or the benghazi attacks while challenging trump on his record on the iraq war and real estate career. but lawmakers said the new york businessman should have taken every opportunity to bring up those issues, which have dogged clinton’s presidential campaign. “she might as well have emailed the russians her email address!” rep. daniel webster, r-fla., exclaimed tuesday about clinton’s use of a private email server. a recent washington post/abc news poll found that just 36 percent of voters see clinton as honest and trustworthy, compared with 45 percent for trump. trump, who has never run for public office, held limited debate practice and did not take part in any mock debates, according to campaign advisers, while clinton was still preparing as late as monday afternoon. some top republicans praised trump for effectively making his case to american voters. “i saw hillary clinton give a polished, well-rehearsed defense of the status quo,” house speaker paul ryan, r-wis., told reporters tuesday. “i saw donald trump give a spirited voice to those of us who don’t like the status quo.” trump, ryan continued, showed “for 90 minutes he could go toe to toe with hillary clinton.” sen. john mccain, r-ariz., the 2008 republican presidential candidate, said the debate “was very interesting.” while many republicans gathered to watch the debate in washington, it wasn’t required viewing for everyone. “i was on an airplane,” sen. marco rubio, r-fla., told reporters. rep. john katko, r-n.y., who is in a tough re-election race in upstate new york, also declined to answer questions about the debate tuesday. abc’s ali rogin contributed.      trump missed opportunities against clinton in first debate, republicans say      
__label__0 president obama painted donald trump as unprepared and temperamentally unfit to be commander-in-chief after the first presidential debate. "anybody who was watching the debate, i think got a sense that you got really sharply-contrasting visions about where we should take the country. and i’m admittedly biased. i have worked with hillary. i know her. she is well-prepared. she’s got the right temperament for the job," obama said in an interview with "on air with ryan seacrest." he contrasted that with what what he believes trump has demonstrated. "the other guy doesn’t have the preparation, the temperament or the core values of inclusion and making everybody, you know, have opportunity that would take our country forward," he said. obama described why he thinks this election is particularly important and why voters need to turn out. "every election is a big election. this one’s especially big just because there’s such big differences between the two candidates, and people need to register to vote," he said. "there's only one candidate in this race -- hillary clinton -- who's actually qualified to do the job and make good decisions for us." the president expressed concern over trump's stance on two issues he thinks will be pivotal to his daughters' generation --- nuclear non-proliferation and climate change. "i get worried when i hear somebody like donald trump start saying, 'well, i don't necessarily know whether japan or north korea should be protected by us, maybe they should get their own nuclear weapon.' that shows somebody who doesn't pay attention to these issues and you don't necessarily want close to the nuclear button," he said. the president added, "when you hear somebody like trump say he thinks this is a plot of the chinese, it's a fraud and a hoax when 99 percent of scientists are saying, 'no we've got to do something about this. that worries me.'" asked what he thinks when his name is mentioned in a debate, obama said, "if i got heated about stuff that was said about me at this point, i would be even more in the grey than i already am. i've developed a pretty thick skin."       president obama says trump doesn't have 'preparation,' 'temperament' and 'values'      
__label__1 a dallas police officer, seeing red after several shootings of police officers, has decided heâs had enough and he and his lawyer, are going to punish everyone they absolutely can for allegedly conspiring to create a race war. yes, this is the same ârace warâ that the entire right sees whenever people call attention to the racism that permeates our justice system. police sergeant demetrick pennie, a 17-year veteran of the dallas police force, is suing leaders of the black lives matter movement â along with the rev. al sharpton, billionaire george soros, louis farrakhan, former attorney general eric holder, president obama, hillary clinton, and many more. the bizarre part is that he and his attorney, right-wing nut larry klayman, actually see an active conspiracy here: âthis is a civil action for the deprivation of plaintiffs and other members of the class herein of their civil rights, conspiracy against the plaintiffs and other members of the class herein civil rights and obstruction of justice to prevent the enforcement of civil rights.â the complaint also says this: âklayman received a call from defendant new black panther party and black lives matter acting in concert with the other defendants, all of whom are working together to ignite and continue the race war they have fomented, threatening to kill him and his family.â [emphasis mine] in discussing the july 7 murders of dallas police officers, the lawsuit states that the shooting suspect claimed he was acting alone, and was not affiliated with black lives matter or anything else. an investigation into his background allegedly revealed that he was a member of the nation of islam and the new black panther party. apparently, thatâs enough to tie him and these groups directly to hillary, obama, holder, and everyone else, although itâs hard to see how klayman and pennie actually know thereâs a conspiracy here. itâs like they just â the complaint repeatedly states something along these lines: âdefendants, acting in concert, and each and every one of them are inciting the imminent serious bodily injury and killing of police officers and other law enforcement personsâ¦â âacting in concertâ means thereâs a knowing cooperation between two or more people to accomplish something. thereâs no real, concrete evidence that anybody is actively working with anyone else to incite violence against police officers. yet, they keep using that phrase. we do not think it means what they think it means. either that, or a frightening amount of paranoia fueled this. or both. itâs probably both. the complaint also accuses everyone of spreading the fiction that police officers âare intentionally and systematically targeting and hunting blacks and other minorities to kill them for no reason other than racism or sport.â exaggerate much, klayman? lords, gods and minor deities, itâs amazing these conclusions are in an actual complaint filed in an actual court. other known problems, such as arresting or shooting black people not guilty of any crimes, and that minorities are arrested and prosecuted disproportionately to the general population, are fiction on the planet from whence this complaint arose, too. klayman, however, has been looking for a reason to file a suit like this for some time. back in july, he threatened to sue obama, farrakhan, sharpton and black lives matter for putting his life in danger âas a white person.â at the time, he said things like this: âit is no wonder some cops, fearing for their lives in this anti-white, anti-semitic and anti-christian environment, sometimes are prone to literally pull the trigger too quickly.â heâs not exactly the most credible person here. he has an axe to grind, and it doesnât make pennie look good for retaining him for this suit (or did klayman persuade pennie to finally give him what he needs to make a suit stick? we may never know). the discovery phase of this lawsuit ought to be interesting. the entire 66-page complaint is below: [scribd id=324251965 key=key-2xesbru2vkk8s40tromu mode=scroll]       a dallas cop just filed suit against obama, hillary, black lives matter for really bizarre conspiracy

__label__1 as news of more frequent police shootings appear in the media. people are asking why is this happening more now than before. many theories have been proposed.   more crime… more drug use.. and so on.  there is one that has not been mentioned unitl now.  you heard it here first. when did the police shootings begin to increase? was it in the 2000s..?  the teens? or the 1960s..70s .. 80s or 1990s…?  even during the riotous years of the sixtys  there were not as many leo ..law enforcement officer ..shootings. i  recall many years when officers said they had gone an entire career without firing their weapon on duty.   a cursory search seems to indicate these shootings began more often from about the late 1980s on to present. that was about the same time  an officer dennis tueller in salt lake city introduced his study on timing of attacks.  this has become widely known among leo  departments all across the country as the tueller drill. this same drill is also trained in concealed carry classes. how long does it take an attacker to get to you from a standing position? think about that for a moment, imagine a bg bad guy standing twenty one feet from you. he has a knife or a bat.  how long do you think it would take?   tueller found that from about twenty one feet.. it takes an attacker about two seconds, or less to get to you.  two  seconds. so  beginning in the 1980s  leo depeartments begain to train officers in the tueller drill.   bad guy. knife. twenty one feet.  no warning signal. you act when he moves toward you. draw and fire. now you can see what i believe is one of  the arguably biggest reasons for many of the now familiar shootings.  this is not to condemn the tueller drill or leos for using it.  it is well founded an well  reasoned.    this is simply to inform why its happening .  if anything the burden is on the guy standing in front  of an officer.  don’t charge an officer.  you will regret it.         the frightening rise in law enforcement officer shootings      
__label__1 dear president bush. i am interested in buying the artwork that you recently offered. you are multi-talented and an amazing man! i have been a faithful defender and supporter of you and your policies. however, your lack of support for the republican party and presidential nominee has left me confused and disappointed. your silence in the face of republicans, including your father, supporting the opposition has made me question your judgment and integrity. silence and passivity have historically allowed great tragedies to unfold. it would be a tragedy to elect a president who would continue to accelerate the destruction of principals that we hold dear. as stated, i would like to buy your artwork – but not if it symbolizes a world view that no longer supports conservative ideals. i would like to be able to continue to support and defend the bush family. i cannot do so until it is clear where your support and loyalty stand. please make clear to the american people that your will honor your legacy by opposing the radical left and supporting conservative values. the decline of america has been precipitous and needs to be stopped. i look forward to your reply.       a letter to president bush      
__label__1 “i’ve never seen anything like this. he’s the republican obama in terms of online fundraising.” — a senior gop operative about donald trump across the internet many political observers are wondering if donald trump has become the republican version of barack obama. over the weekend, mr. trump stood up to decry the obvious acts of terrorism in new jersey and new york. for his efforts he was attacked, criticized, and derided by liberals and their partners in the media. as new york governor andrew cuomo (d-ny) and new york city mayor bill de blasio (d-ny) refused to call the terrorism what it was, hillary clinton attacked trump for his “rhetoric.” arguing that by talking tough, mr. trump was somehow giving “aid and comfort to the enemy.” “i don’t want to speculate but here’s what we know about i think it is important for voters to hear this and weigh it in making their choice in november,” clinton said. “we know that a lot of the rhetoric used by donald trump is being seized upon by terrorists.“ clinton says trump's rhetoric has "given aid and comfort" to terrorists. phrase is definition of treason. — zeke miller (@zekejmiller) september 19, 2016  in fact, the left, almost as one, decried trump’s comments as problematic and insinuated that he was encouraging muslim terrorism by condemning the attacks. however, most americans seem to have agreed with mr. trump, and by monday most liberals in and out of the media had also come to realize that trump’s early comments were correct. we don’t yet know how the weekend’s events will play into the upcoming election, but we can look at a few other indicators that give trump and his supporters reason to be optimistic. fundraising for example. donald trump has already, with 7 weeks left before election day, outraised both john mccain and mitt romney among “small donors.” republican presidential nominee donald trump has raised as much as $100 million from small-dollar donors contributing $200 or less to his campaign — in less than three months. trump’s campaign has surpassed a “threshold no previous republican has ever achieved in a single campaign,” according to politico, which looked over federal election commission filings and spoke with operatives familiar with the campaign’s fundraising efforts. all of this also shows what could be a building trump tsunami…   read the rest of the story at the daily surge…       after new york attack, donald trump hits new highs!

__label__1 obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the u.n. assembly. during it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating isis and other islamic extremist groups in syria and otherwise. he spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his "jv team." seeing as the u.s. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle. the daily caller reports that obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the islamic state group. he cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution. "if we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long," said obama. president obama continued by saying that we must "be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy." he mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the islamic state group he also categorized syria as "a place like syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won." instead obama suggested that we "pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect." which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.  it's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical islam and death and violence. these are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected muslim terrorist. it's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some jv team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse. it's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. we're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. if we don't take action soon, then obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality. make sure to share this on facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical islam. source: conservative tribune  tags: isis, obama      breaking: obama just disgraced the u.s. by surrendering to isis in front of entire u.n.      
__label__1 sheriff parnell mcnamara for the vast majority of normal individuals, it wasn’t all that long ago, when we heard a phrase such as “all lives matter” we thought of it as a positive loving encompassing an inclusive statement, in that everyone’s life had purpose and should be celebrated regardless of race, age, sexual orientation or gender. now fast forward to today and that innocent phrase that might have been spoken just a few short years ago has taken a life all its own, among the politically correct and entitlement class. leave it to progressives and race hustlers to cleverly create a subtext of words and phrases, specifically designed to change the underlying or implicit meaning of those words and phrases original intent. and that’s perhaps where mclennan county’s top law enforcement officer, sheriff parnell mcnamara, finds himself. it seems that the hapless sheriff isn’t up to speed with the continued changes taking place within the race baiting world of political correctness, and he’s now paying the price. his “carnal sin” was to purchase a full-page ad, in the hometown news that says “all lives matter,” which of course has set off a firestorm of protests from the usual cast of characters mcnamara acknowledged he bought the ad because of what he believes, saying: “i remember talking to someone about ‘all lives matter,’ because it aggravated me when someone said ‘all lives matter’ is a racial slur. all lives matter. your life matters, mine, police, john q citizen. it doesn’t matter what color you are. every human being has a right to live.” and no doubt most traditional americans feel exactly the same way; however sheriff mcnamara works within a political environment where the political establishment sets the rules governed by what is currently politically correct, and publicly stating that “all lives matter” is now considered a racist statement within the bastions of progressive orthodoxy. and making that point was jo welter, community race relations coalition board chairman, saying; “you can say, ‘all lives matter,’ but the fact is throughout our history, and even currently, we do not value black lives as much as we do other lives.” then welter went on to carefully cherry pick data that bolstered his ridicules claim. “black lives matter” is divisive and counterproductive, state rep. charles “doc” anderson said. “it doesn’t help the issues. it’s inflammatory, and i think it’s intended to be so,” he said. “most members of the black community realize that all lives matter.” mcnamara added, “i know of no police officer that puts his badge and gun on in the morning and goes to work wanting to hurt someone or kill someone,” he said. “we have black police officers that have been killed. it’s a movement against police out there that’s absolutely wrong.” sheriff’s office sgt. lionel mcgee, put it all together. he is a black police officer who does not support blm. he said some in the blm movement will never support police. he said, “i tell people all the time, the incident that sparked all this with michael brown in ferguson, i probably would have done the same thing. you know, that’s what started it. the deal with (eric) garner in new york. he was 300-something pounds. i had this argument with my own sister. how come mr. garner couldn’t have said, ‘hey, y’all caught me selling illegal cigarettes on the street. you got me and put my hands behind my back, and let’s go to jail.’ he’d still be alive today. “if somebody’s fighting and struggling with you and you’re trying to arrest them and you’re doing everything in your power to arrest them, and that person don’t want to go and they happen to die or get injured or get seriously hurt, i can’t see that as being my fault.” do you agree with this sheriff's ad that states "all lives matter" or is this an insult to the black community? let us know what you think in the comments below. source: waco tribune       texas sheriff faces huge backlash from blm over his “all lives matter” ad, he’s not backing down…      
__label__1 a frustrated federal judge ordered the state department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former secretary of state hillary clinton and her top aides. judge richard leon ruled tuesday in favor of the daily caller news foundation by rejecting the state department’s motion to dismiss thedcnf’s freedom of information act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the freedom of information act. but he also denied thedcnf’s request to depose state department officials. the state department has been unable to produce any records confirming that clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. in addition to clinton, thedcnf seeks the same records for former clinton chief of staff cheryl mills, deputy chief of staff huma abedin and advisor jacob sullivan. leon has been impatient with state department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. he ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by sept. 26 and the rest of them by oct. 10. bradley moss, one of the attorneys representing thedcnf, said “judge leon’s order made clear his frustration with the state department’s continued obstruction of the foia process. state will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” fbi director james comey told reporters in a july 7 news conference he regarded the former secretary of state as a “careless” federal official when she set up a private and unsecured email server in her new york home. comey did not end up recommending prosecution of the former secretary of state. national security agency officials were aghast to learn early in clinton’s term that she insisted on using an unsecured personal blackberry phone within the confines of her state department office. unsecured digital devices are banned from the secretary’s office. state department officials admitted in a july 29 response to thedcnf that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by clinton or her aides. department officials balked at searching computer hard drives in clinton’s executive offices or in security offices where security awareness training is arranged for all of the department’s 45,000 employees and foreign service officers. in an aug. 31 hearing, leon told justice department attorney jason lee the documents should be released before the november election. “i’m sure you can appreciate mr. lee, there is a certain time sensitivity on this issue,” leon said. “we’re looking down the barrel of a presidential election from now in two months.” content created by the daily caller news foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience. for licensing opportunities of our original content, please contact [email protected] .       breaking: federal judge just dropped an order on hillary she never saw coming

__label__1 the house oversight committee has ordered the website reddit to preserve copies of posts purportedly published by the computer technician who appears to have asked for advice for how to strip hillary clinton’s email address from her emails. (if you are unfamiliar with the story, read this first) utah rep. jason chaffetz, the chairman of the oversight committee, told the hill that the order “has the weight of law, you can’t destroy things and hope things magically get erased.” the posts in question appear to have been made by paul combetta, a technician at platte river networks, a denver-based computer firm that clinton hired in 2013 to manage her private server. they were deleted on monday, just after internet sleuths discovered them and circulated them across the web. in the posts, a user going by the handle “stonetear” asked other users for advice on how to “strip out” email addresses from the account of a “vip.” “basically, they don’t want the vip’s email address exposed to anyone, and want to be able to either strip out or replace the email address in the to/from fields in all of the emails we want to send out,” reads the post, which was published on july 24, 2014. that date is a significant point on the clinton email timeline. just the day before, the house select committee on benghazi had reached an agreement with the state department to obtain clinton’s work-related emails. the fbi’s report of its investigation of clinton’s emails shows that that same month, combetta transferred backups of clinton’s emails to two of her lawyers, cheryl mills and heather samuelson. “stonetear’s” post on reddit raises questions about what was being covered up. and if “stonetear” is combetta, as seems likely, the reddit post would not be the first example of the technician engaging in an apparent cover-up. combetta is the technician who used a software program called bleachbit to delete backups of clinton’s emails in late march 2015, weeks after clinton’s email setup was revealed in the press and after congress had subpoenaed all of her records. he also lied to the fbi during an initial interview about his decision to use bleachbit. regardless, the justice department granted him immunity in exchange for his cooperation with the email investigation. last week, combetta and another platte river networks technician named bill thornton declined to testify at a house oversight committee hearing. both technicians pleaded the fifth. the allegations that combetta posted questions about clinton’s server on reddit “fit the pattern of what we think was happening,” chaffetz told the hill. another oversight committee member, north carolina rep. mark meadows, said that while the circumstantial evidence “certainly points in one direction” — that “stonetear” is combetta — the committee wants to have definitive proof that he is. “we’re just trying to make doubly sure that we can authenticate that in a real way, because if not it will be challenged on a number of fronts,” meadows told the hill. chaffetz also said that the committee has to verify the authenticity of the posts, “but we are pursuing it with vigor.” numerous clues have surfaced which strongly suggest that “stonetear” is combetta. combetta’s email address is [email protected] , and other posts from the user refer to facts known about combetta, such as that he lives in rhode island. thedc uncovered other clues which lend more evidence to support the case that combetta is the reddit user. in some of the reddit posts, “stonetear” refers to an email encryption service that platte river networks uses called mimecast. he also refers to datto, inc., a cloud storage company that prn hired to service clinton’s server. a spokesman for platte river networks told thedc on tuesday that the company is not yet ready to comment on the matter but that it will “soon.” content created by the daily caller news foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience. for licensing opportunities of our original content, please contact [email protected]       breaking: jason chaffetz drops game-changer on hillary that exposes everything

__label__1 hillary clinton missed a fundraiser in north carolina. the campaign says the event was “postponed.” however the fact is she missed the biggest thing that people running from political office do: fundraise sure, hillary clinton has a lot of ill-gotten haitian money. but by trump standards she’s still “dead broke.” therefore, her absence from a fundraiser suggests something is afoot. the campaign gave no reason for her absence, yet hillary is not campaigning either. we don’t expect an explanation for that either. the event was to be in chapel hill, and some of the wealthiest democrats in the state were prepared to buy access. according to cbs north carolina, the even to take place at the home of betty craven and michael warner. it was billed as: “lunch with hillary rodham clinton.” costs ranged from $2,700 to $100,000. in case you caught hillary clinton on jimmy fallon on monday, that was previously taped in new york on friday, less than a week after hillary got the clean bill of health. as her doctor put it, hillary is “fit to lead.” nevertheless, we could find nothing on clinton’s campaign strategy for today. i ask again, “where’s waldo?”           where’s waldo: hillary clinton no show at fundraiser

__label__1 hillary and the compliant media are doing everything they can to derail trump’s surge in the polls and keep hillary propped up (literally). there seems to be some movement among blacks toward trump. a five or ten percent shift in the black vote toward trump would be significant. when things begin to go south for democrats, they play the race card. claiming that president obama might not have been born in the united states is a “race card” issue. trump raised it in 2011. this forced hawaiian authorities to release a copy of obama’s birth certificate, although it was not a copy of the original. it’s obvious from the historical record that trump did not originate the birther issue. it was floating around before he took up the quest for the truth. from what we know, and the media are not reporting, the birther subject was spawned in the bowels of the clinton campaign. did hillary personally promote it? probably not. it was done by surrogates so she could claim plausible deniability. “who me?” she had and has her “buffers” like all crime families do. the following scene is from the godfather ii senate hearing:  here is some of what we know: “[ben smith and byron tau] detailed in a lengthy four-page-long investigation how in april 2008, when clinton was slipping in her battle against obama for the democratic nomination for the presidency, ‘clinton supporters’—as they say—circulated an anonymous email chain that pushed the theory. “‘barack obama’s mother was living in kenya with his arab-african father late in her pregnancy. she was not allowed to travel by plane then, so barack obama was born there and his mother then took him to hawaii to register his birth,’ the email that clinton supporters circulated read.” “those anonymous people were hardly the only ones. in fact, as joshua green reported in the atlantic in august 2008, a march 19, 2007 strategy memo from longtime clinton adviser mark penn proves that the clinton campaign itself was pushing the conspiracy theory. penn, in the memo, advocated that clinton target obama’s ‘lack of american roots.’” (breitbart) read more: “hillary clinton and the true history of obama ‘birtherism.’” i suggest that you read the entire breitbart article to see how hillary’s 2008 presidential campaign was knee-deep in the suggestion that obama was not born in the united states and his “lack of american roots.”[1] but the birther issue goes back further – to 1991. joseph farah of wnd asks, “who was the first ‘birther’?” “trump was hardly the first ‘birther.’ neither was i. nor was my colleague jerome corsi. and neither was hillary clinton. “that honor belongs to one person and one person alone – barack obama.” how is this possible? “obama went to extreme lengths to conceal his past. and, indeed, if he was born in the u.s. and was eligible to serve as president, he certainly did his best to create the mystery that led to the question being asked. “years earlier, he billed himself as having been born in kenya. “maybe he thought it was a sexy way to sell books, get a foreign student scholarship, attract women – who knows? “but it’s a fact that he boasted about it.” (wnd) the evidence? it comes from a short bio that was “used by barack obama’s literary agency beginning in 1991 and ending in 2007 – the year he declared his candidacy for president.” here’s the first sentence of the opening paragraph (breitbart): “barack obama, the first african-american president of the harvard law review, was born in kenya and raised in indonesia and hawaii.”  even snopes says it’s true. the editor of the short biography states that it “was a simple mistake and nothing more” to say that obama was born in kenya.  i’ll take him at his word. i can’t take him at his word given what the two images below show. it remains a fact that there was a biography from a “client list acton & dystel published in 1991” that states that obama was born in kenya that remained unquestioned until 2007. obama himself had 16 years to disavow the information and call for a correction. it would have been unusual for a literary agency not to send a copy of the bio to obama for his approval. are we to believe that in 16 years in never saw the bio? in addition, there is ample evidence that people inside the clinton campaign gave credence to the kenyan birther issue for political reasons in order to sabotage obama’s campaign. the media will continue to claim that hillary clinton had nothing to do with the birther issue because a lie is better than a trump presidency. update: the following images were posted on my facebook page. in this first image, in june 1998, jane dystel literary management company was still reporting that obama was born in kenya  as recent as 2007, dystel & goderich literary management continued the narrative that obama was born in kenya:                     _____________________________ [1] “note from senior management [at breitbart]: andrew breitbart was never a ‘birther,’ and breitbart news is a site that has never advocated the narrative of ‘birtherism.’ in fact, andrew believed, as we do, that president barack obama was born in honolulu, hawaii, on august 4, 1961.” reposted with permission from constitution.com  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      update: obama’s bio from 1991, 1998, and 2007 all state he was “born in kenya”      
__label__1 in his final speech to the worthless united nations security council, barack hussein obama soetoro sobarkah urged that americans give up their liberty and sovereignty and submit to world government. in stark contrast to founding father benjamin franklin, who uttered the famous words, “those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety,” obama called on americans to give up more liberty for security.  “we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations like my own accept constraints,” obama said. he then added that “powerful nations” like the united states must give up their autonomy to realize security. “i’m convinced in the long run giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests but binding ourselves to international rules, over the long-term, enhances our security.” obama said. of course, obama was doing this to praise the united nations, an organization that is anti-american, anti-christian and totalitarian at its core. so, what’s the problem? obama is convinced and that should make us just fall in line? wasn’t he the guy that was convinced obamacare would lower costs and provide everyone with health insurance? did that materialize? nope. this man has lied through his teeth the entire time he has been in office and we’ve documented that. while obama, a clear foreigner by his words, his wife’s word’s, a kenyan ambassador and the record of the kenyan parliament (despite what trump and others say), claims that his view is the right one, he also acknowledges that real americans, born and bred here, oppose him. these people do so rightly. “sometimes i’m criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions, but i’m convinced in the long run…” obama said. “we have to put our money where our mouths are.” yes, but the problem is america is not normal to the international community. she has been unique throughout her history. she was unique because her foundation was established upon the bible, not upon “international norms,” which were pagan in origin. that’s what made america great. “i believe that at this moment we all face a choice,” obama added after denouncing the building of a southern wall on the us border. “we can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration or we can retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion. i want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not back.” while i do agree with some bit of cooperation as in working with other countries on trade and things of that nature, which george washington acknowledged we should do, i disagree with how obama believes that we do that. his idea is to reward bad behavior, even to encourage it and to redistribute the wealth of the united states. that is not only unconstitutional, it’s immoral and wrong and he has no authority to do such things. yet, congress and the people have allowed him to do it. finally, obama stated that the united nations was established to replace the ravages of war with peaceful cooperation. no, it was not. the majority of countries in the united nations are either communists, socialists or islamists. there is nothing peaceful about those ideologies in the least. as a friend of mine aptly stated, “they (the founders of the un) wanted the organization they formed to be perceived as a dove when in reality it was to be a venomous snake.” this is not the first time obama has pushed this globalist mentality either. remember when he addressed dignitaries and members of nato in 2014? if not, click here to listen to that speech. even conservatives were livid that we pointed out what he was actually saying. view the entire speech to the united nations below.       the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      obama says it’s time to give up liberty and submit to world government

__label__1 mohamed hamada’s book the trump revolution is available for free here until the election.  read introduction and chapter i here.  the dishonorable businessmen! the elite! before i start whipping the corrupt, dishonorable businessmen, i want to note two points: the first point, this book is written from the point of view of a capitalist who believes in honorable businessmen who, in turn, are responsible for building the country, and employing its people. with the “country,” i mean america not china or mexico. the second point, i can hear someone saying trump is a businessman and he is from the elite. let me say something, when you play a sport and you want to be successful you follow the rules that are set for the game even if you don’t like them. however, if you head the federation of that sport you would have a chance to change the rules that you do not believe in. now we are ready for the whipping. the elite of this country, a group of very rich businessmen. they own almost everything including the media and the politicians. you can even call them the neo-lords. let’s tell an old story that we all know to see where the neo-lords emerged from. america is the land of the free. the peasants fled europe from the oppression of their lords, the hunger, the illness, etc. they fled to america to live as free farmers, until the neo-lords grew again in the land of the free. at the old time the lord was the owner and the ruler. now, the neo-lords, who are the elite businessmen, are the owners and they own the rulers, the politicians shall we say. they even went further, and decided to own the minds and hearts of the people, so they decided to own the media and they even penetrated the churches. the lord-peasant system found its way again to the land of the free. the system developed. after a struggle, the american people adapted to the new system and forced their elite businessmen to adapt to the idea that they are dealing with free people. the elite businessmen uncomfortable with the idea that the american people are not peasants enough, they decided to leave to where they can find real peasants. they got their bought-off politicians to sign a couple of regional and international free trade agreements. the factories moved to china, mexico and other countries as a consequence. apparently, the elite-businessmen found that their multi-billion dollars are not big enough fortune, so they moved to china to make an extra couple of billions of dollars on cheap labor. probably, they were afraid that their children might starve and they need an extra couple of billions to make sure they are full. in the transition, they are using america as a market, a dwindling market. it shrinks as more and more factories are closing and moving abroad. consequently, more and more workers are laid off. and so, less shoppers and buyers. an economy cannot be sustained by the people selling services to each other and producing nothing. the elite-businessmen are milking the cows to the last drop and slaughtering them one after one. quite like the lords in the earlier history, when they are fed-up with a town and the people are harder to rule; they pillage it, burn it and move to another town to start again. that is what the corrupt elite of the united states’ businessmen are doing. they use their politicians and their media to get the job done. the corruption prevailed, but the free americans figured out that there is something wrong and they started to revolt. they did not know where to start and what to do, so donald trump jumped in and decided to lead them. stand up america, the leader is here. so how should an honorable businessman be? the businessman is a career. like any career, it has its duties and its ethics. so what are the duties? the businessman’s job is building the elements of the economy of the country using his special abilities; like his skills, knowledge, personal character etc. he has to take part in building the country. he has to be involved in forming and executing plans to develop the country. before and after these, he is responsible for employing the people of his country and getting the best out of them. to accomplish that, he has to socially secure the lives of the workers to make them feel that the time and effort are worth giving. for the businessman to achieve this goal, he has to watch for the health of his workers, physical, mental and psychological. what i mentioned are not newly innovated ideas. many companies are famous for their “good benefits and pay.” that’s what a businessman is supposed to do. what are our elite-businessmen doing? they are shutting factories’ doors, they lay off workers and they move the factories to other countries. then, they force the people of the united states to buy the products of the factories they moved to the other countries!!! i hate to be sarcastic, but “what a patriotic and responsible action.” i can hear them murmuring: “hmm……. the workers have to help themselves, to stand for themselves hmm…..” congratulations for increasing your profits greedy blood suckers. imagine that all the american medical doctors decided to close the hospitals and to move them to another countries. so, to make more money, they leave the american patients to stand for themselves. imagine if a man decided to abandon his family for a rich woman leaving his wife and children to stand for themselves. what are the nationalities of these gluttonous misers? could they have closed the factories without buying the politicians? the answer is no. could they have done this without a cover-up from their media? the answer is no. selfishness, greed, i would say treason. the elite-businessmen formed an alliance against donald trump, why? he is the only politician who stood up and spoke out about getting the factories back to america. don’t believe those who started to hijack his ideas after almost a year of campaigning, they found themselves loosing. they will not touch this subject when they get the presidency. they are just elite-businessmen’s pawns. if they believe in getting the factories back, they would not have waited that long to mention it during their campaigns. they just found themselves loosing. the elite-businessmen’s media: here we are talking about all of what is called the mainstream media. most all the news channels owned by the elite-businessmen. trump should be proud they are all against him. have you ever seen any other candidate being grilled by them like they grill trump? they pressure trump as hard as they can then they catch any of his tongue-slips. they make stories and they keep wailing and screaming about these tongue-slips non-stop!!! they ignore the real issues like jobs and economy and they look for personal issues about trump and they talk about his personal issues nostop. while on the other hand, they avoid hillary’s scandals. best case scenario, they hardly mention it briefly, then they try to cast doubts on these scandals. what should the job of the media be? showing the people the truth about what is happening. displaying the real problems facing the people according to the people’s priorities. explaining what is being plotted against them. that is what they are supposed to do. but, what are they really doing? tranquilizing the people by dragging their attention to anything other than their real life problems. entertaining the people and making them laugh and enjoy their life while the country is being set on fire. wake up america!!! have you ever seen cnn and her sister channels going with their cameras to show the closed, abandoned factories? have you ever seen them roaming with their cameras in the streets of abandoned ghost towns? did they interview laid off workers or the abused walmart workers who are even being replaced by machines. have they shown all of that on their screens? but you know what? we are on the move, and we found a father, a leader who is listening to us, and speaks and acts on our behalf. stand up america, the leader is here. the elite-businessmen’s politicians: welcome to the employees of the elite- businessmen. they call them senators, representatives and even presidents. they belong to two owned companies that are called political parties: republicans and democrats. most of these politicians in the last 50 years are bought and sold. they are playing a game they call an election. the rule of the game; let the people get indulged in ideological battles, conservatives against liberals but make sure they don’t break free from the exploitation of the elite-businessmen. it does not matter who wins, the factories were sent and being sent abroad by republican presidents, democratic presidents, republican congress, democratic congress etc. were the people asked to approve or disapprove the free trade agreements? i mean were these agreements among the issues the candidates were talking about in their election campaigns before they signed them? the people are only allowed to make the country 5% more conservative or 5% more liberal. it looks like trump is taking it far away, beyond what the people are allowed to change. let me recite a scenario that would show how a catastrophic decision would be taken behind the people’s backs: the elite-businessmen speaking to a to-be president: you look like you can make a good president… you are smart or else we wouldn’t have approached you… we will make you president in return for a favor……. we want you to do so and so…. if you don’t follow, we will destroy you….no second term…..and/ or big scandal…. you get us angry and you are a dead dog…. end of the scenario. it is literally a deal with the devil. they ask the politician for a catastrophic decision that feeds their greed and harm the people. listen greedy-hearts, no more of these dirty tricks. stand up america: donald j. trump is here. read chapter iii here.  mohamed hamada’s book the trump revolution is available for free here until the election.   the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising.com get your daily dose of eagle rising by entering your email address below.      the trump revolution: chapter ii      
__label__0 (cnn)early numbers from iowa and north carolina, where voters are already casting absentee ballots, look promising for democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton. and democrats have also improved their position on the voter rolls in colorado and florida, outpacing republicans in the past month, according to a cnn analysis of newly released statistics. where and when to vote early voters in a handful of states have already started to request, receive, and cast absentee ballots, and some states publicly disclose how many republicans and democrats have requested ballots. of course, there is no guarantee that all voters will stay loyal to their party when they cast their ballot, and no results from any states will be announced until polls close on election day, november 8. in north carolina, more than 56,000 people have requested absentee ballots: 36% of them were democrats and 35% were republicans. another 28% were independents, according to the north carolina state board of elections. over 3,600 ballots already cast in north carolina more than 3,600 people in north carolina have apparently they've decided that they've seen enough of the 2016 campaign and already cast their ballots. it's a tiny fraction of voters -- more than 4.5 million people participated in the tar heel state in the 2012 presidential election. democrats have returned 1,508 ballots, or 41%; republicans 1,227 ballots, or 34%; and independents 909 ballots, or 29%, as of wednesday, according to the north carolina state board of elections. in iowa, more than 91,000 voters have asked for absentee ballots, according to the secretary of state's office. in all, 57% of those voters are registered democrats, 22% are independents and 21% are republicans. these are decent numbers for clinton, but there is a significant drop-off from 2012. at this point, four years ago, more than 105,000 democrats had requested absentee ballots. so far this year, only 51,663 democrats have asked for ballots. the number for republicans was almost the same both years. democrats add voters in florida, colorado democrats have seen their position improve in some key states when it comes to voter registration. shifts in registration don't necessarily indicate which party is attracting new voters, because people switch parties, move to new states, and are removed from the rolls when they die. but these statistics contextualize the political landscape and are helpful data points in the big picture of electoral analysis. democrats padded their existing registration edge in florida, by adding almost 16,000 more voters to the rolls in the past month than republicans did, according to the florida department of state. their overall advantage in the state is about 274,000. it might seem like a nearly insurmountable a lead, but it isn't. president barack obama had an even larger advantage in 2012, but he only carried the sunshine state that year by about 74,000 votes. out west, in colorado, democrats have nearly erased what was once a formidable republican registration advantage. they outpaced republicans by about 9,000 voters in the past month, according to new data from the colorado secretary of state. that means the republican registration advantage in colorado is only about 2,600 right now. it was nearly 12,000 in august, and it was three times that size in november 2012, when obama carried the state. registration numbers have been stable in several other key swing states. that's good news for democrats in pennsylvania, north carolina and nevada, where they have the advantage. and that's good news for the gop in new hampshire and iowa, where there are more republicans on the rolls. currently, democrats lead republicans by about 919,000 registered voters in pennsylvania, about 644,000 in north carolina and about 71,000 in nevada. republicans lead democrats by about 34,000 registered voters in iowa and about 24,000 in new hampshire. the voter rolls were very stable in both states in the past month. for example, the gop edge in iowa grew by only 175 votes since august.       newest absentee, registration numbers promising for clinton      
__label__0 washington (cnn)president barack obama vetoed a bill friday that would allow family members of 9/11 victims to sue saudi arabia, pitting him against congress and both presidential candidates on an emotionally charged matter. the white house claimed the legislation could expose us diplomats and servicemen to litigation in other countries. republican and democratic leaders in congress say they'll override obama's veto next week. obama has now issued 12 vetoes. if successful, congress' override would be the first of obama's presidency. support for the "justice against sponsors of terrorism act" ran high among lawmakers, who overwhelmingly passed the bill earlier this year after pressure from victims' groups. the bill would end foreign countries' immunity in the united states from lawsuits, allowing federal civil suits to go forward if the country is determined to have had a hand in a us terror attack. in his veto message, obama wrote he had "deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001, who have suffered grievously." but he maintained the legislation would seriously hurt us national security interests and cause harm to important alliances, saying it "would neither protect americans from terrorist attacks nor improve the effectiveness of our response to such attacks." he warned that the law would hurt the effectiveness of the administration's action against terrorism by taking questions of foreign states' involvement in terrorism "out of the hands of national security and foreign policy professionals and placing them in the hands of private litigants and courts." obama also said the move would open americans abroad, especially those serving in the military, to prosecutions by foreign countries, since this would remove the reciprocal agreements that now protect both sides from such lawsuits. he also pointed to complaints that allied nations have made about the measure. this legislation, he said, "threatens to limit their cooperation on key national security issues, including counterterrorism initiatives, at a crucial time when we are trying to build coalitions, not create divisions." demonstrating the difficult political position the white house is in, democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton, obama's former secretary of state, expressed her support for the legislation friday. "clinton continues to support the efforts by sen. (chuck) schumer and his colleagues in congress to secure the ability of 9/11 families and other victims of terror to hold accountable those responsible," said jesse lehrich, a clinton spokesman. "she would sign this legislation if it came to her desk." following the veto, republican presidential contender donald trump said in a statement the move "is shameful and will go down as one of the low points of his presidency." trump, too, said he would sign the legislation as president. schumer, a new york democrat who was a lead supporter of the bill, called the veto "a disappointing decision that will be swiftly and soundly overturned in congress." co-sponsor sen. john cornyn, r-texas, said, "i look forward to the opportunity for congress to override the president's veto, provide these families with the chance to seek the justice they deserve and send a clear message that we will not tolerate those who finance terrorism in the united states." white house lobbying effort in recent days, some of the measure's supporters in congress have expressed misgivings about the legislation, prompting a new effort by the administration to lobby against the bill. the white house indicated friday that was still working to sway lawmakers against the bill, saying that some had indicated privately they had doubts about the measure's implications. "if we're focused on the substantive, long-term impact on our nation's national security, that's what's driving the position, that's what's driving the president's decision to veto this bill -- not because it's politically convenient, it's not; it's political inconvenient," press secretary josh earnest said friday. " but when it comes to the stakes and the impact that this could have on our national security, the president is willing to take some political heat in order to try to do the right thing." the lobbying effort on capitol hill against the legislation has involved the administration but also representatives for the saudi government, which denies any involvement in the 9/11 terror attacks. the alliance puts obama in the unlikely position of defending the same position as the kingdom, with which he's had longstanding disputes over counterterrorism strategies and human rights. it also puts the president at odds with family members of 9/11 victims, who protested outside the white house this week and spoke alongside lawmakers from new york and connecticut on capitol hill. they, along with other proponents of the bill, say the language is written narrowly to prevent the types of repercussions the administration predicts. "we are outraged and dismayed at the president's veto of jasta and the unconvincing and unsupportable reasons that he offers as explanation," read a statement from the 9/11 families and survivors. "no matter how much the saudi lobbying and propaganda machine may argue otherwise, jasta is a narrowly drawn statute that restores longstanding legal principles that have enjoyed bipartisan support for decades." veto override plans administration officials had been eying a friday afternoon veto with the hopes of submitting it to lawmakers after congress adjourned until november's election contests. but prolonged negotiations over a government funding bill and a package to combat zika virus have delayed the recess, meaning lawmakers are still likely to be in washington next week to cast an override vote. "our assumption is that the veto will be overridden," senate majority leader mitch mcconnell told reporters on tuesday. house speaker paul ryan followed suit wednesday, saying, "i do think the votes are there for the override." but the wisconsin republican also voiced his own doubts about the legislation, saying the implications for lawsuits against americans worried him. "i worry about legal matters," ryan said. "i worry about trial lawyers trying to get rich off of this. and i do worry about the precedence. at the same time, these victims do need to have their day in court." he was one of several prominent lawmakers who have expressed buyers' remorse for the proposed law. a pair of republican senators, bob corker of tennessee and lindsey graham of south carolina, have pushed for changes to make it more difficult for the families to pursue lawsuits but could also make it harder for the us to be sued for alleged wrongdoing. opponents of the bill gained support wednesday both from the european union, which issued its opposition in the form of a "demarche" statement to the us department of state, and from a bipartisan group of former national security officials, who penned an open letter to obama. "the harm this legislation will cause the united states will be both dramatic and long-lasting," the letter read, citing arguments over weakening sovereign immunity. its signatories included veterans of republican and democratic administrations, including stephen hadley, a national security adviser to president george w. bush; michael mukasey, a us attorney general under bush; william cohen, a secretary of defense under president bill clinton; and richard clarke, a national security aide to bush and clinton. the letter also noted the law, if enacted, "will most certainly undermine our relationship with one of our most important allies, saudi arabia, and damage our relationship with the entire middle east." cnn's dan merica and ted barrett contributed to this report.      obama vetoes 9/11 lawsuit bill      
__label__0 washington (cnn)a series of high-profile breaches and warnings from national intelligence leaders has elections directors in critical battleground states seeking federal help against possible cyberattacks. officials in pennsylvania and ohio tell cnn they are working closely with the department of homeland security to protect their elections systems from cyberattacks and breaches. ohio is going one step further. "we even asked the national guard to attempt to penetrate our databases," said joshua eck, a spokesman for ohio secretary of state jon husted. "we've had a number of really positive tests. it has gone well and we've been able to find vulnerabilities and fix them." a pair of cyberattacks on illinois' and arizona's voter registration databases over the summer spurred the obama administration to ring the alarm bells for states as they prepare for what has already been a chaotic campaign. and top democrats on the house and senate intelligence committees publicly accused the russian government of seeking to alter the election. "based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the u.s. election," sen. dianne feinstein and rep. adam schiff, of california, said thursday. russian intelligence agencies behind us election hacks, lawmakers say cybersecurity experts say the prospect of "rigging" the election, and changing the outcome, is practically impossible. elections are decentralized: 50 states, plus the district of columbia, run their own operations, not to mention the thousands of counties across the country that play a major role at the local level. different jurisdictions use different voting machines, it isn't plausible for hackers to breach them all in one fell swoop -- penetrating one election system in north carolina has no impact on colorado. furthermore, most voting machines aren't connected to the internet, which inoculates them from outside intrusions. but hackers could still cause plenty of havoc in november, with attacks on registration systems or government websites reporting the results on election night. many news organizations pull their results from those sites. "think about the chaos you could cause if you get one tv network calling the election for one candidate, and another network calling the election for the other," said professor herbert lin, a cybersecurity expert at stanford university. "if your intent is to sow doubt and uncertainty, at least in the short term, affecting the media reporting could be really problematic." dhs running 'cyber hygiene scans' homeland security secretary jeh johnson is the obama administration's point man on election security, holding meetings with elections officials from across the country, and offering help to states that are interested. dhs is offering "cyber hygiene scans" that will remotely search for vulnerabilities in election systems like online voter registration systems and election night reporting infrastructure. it is also offering to send cybersecurity experts to states so they can conduct more aggressive in-person testing the final weeks of the campaign. johnson recently laid out other federal resources for states in a memo last week, including a 24/7 center to respond to cyberattacks, and a list of "best practices" on how to secure voter registration databases. pennsylvania has accepted the dhs help, both the remote scans and the in-person testing, said pennsylvania department of state spokeswoman wanda murren. election authorities in ohio are also accepting federal help. but not every state is happy to have the administration involved. georgia's secretary of state publicly scoffed at these efforts and accused the federal government of trying to "subvert the constitution." georgia secretary of state brian kemp, a republican, rebuffed the idea, telling nextgov that the feds might want to "subvert the constitution to achieve the goal of federalizing elections under the guise of security." however, his office later walked back the comment, saying they were not flatly refusing the assistance. a call for comment from kemp was not immediately returned thursday. florida officials, whose recount debacle in 2000 led to the federal law which ultimately created voter registration databases, declined to say whether they were accepting help from dhs, citing security concerns. what are the threats? perhaps the most serious vulnerability is the integrity of voter registration systems. hackers can break in and delete or alter individual voter registration records, creating confusion on election day when voters show up to their polling place and their names are mysteriously missing from the rolls, or their address is changed. this summer, hackers broke into a stash of information for about 90,000 voters in illinois, breaching a database with voters' names, addresses, sex and birthdays. and officials in arizona took their voter registration system offline after they learned that a russian hacker had breached their systems. once hackers penetrate a voter registration system, "the scope could be whatever they want," said cathie brown, who served as virginia's deputy chief information security officer and is a cybersecurity expert with impact makers. "deleting an entire precinct of voters -- that's absolutely possible. the grander the scope, the more likely they'll get caught. but they might not get caught until after they've done the damage." but at least one expert said that state elections directors have been dealing with technological threats for a long time. "the state and local election officials, this whole notion of security is not new to them this is something they deal with all the time," said tim mattice, executive director of the elections center, which trains state and local elections officials on administering elections. mattice's organization works with the professional group representing election officials, the national association of state election directors. mattice said that when dhs offered up help, most people understood them when they said they were making it voluntary and did not want to be viewed as coming in and taking over state-run elections. ironically, mattice noted that the focus on technological security got serious after congress passed the national help america vote act in the wake of the 2000 elections, which mandated that states develop integrated voter registration systems -- effectively placing all the voter data in systems that could be hacked. asked how hackers got through in illinois and arizona despite the layers of security that elections officials already have in place, mattice said it's the same problem any organization or business faces. "you could ask target how they got hacked -- these hackers are getting sophisticated," mattice said.       hacking the election? feds step in as states fret cyber threats      
__label__0 new york (cnn)us secretary of state john kerry met once again with russian counterpart sergei lavrov on friday, as the two countries face a potential turning point in their engagement in syria. "we exchanged some ideas and we had a little bit of progress," kerry said of the meeting. "we're evaluating some mutual ideas in a constructive way." a senior state department official characterized the conversation, which took place on the sidelines of a meeting of the middle east quartet, as brief and informal, but added that it was a "constructive discussion." "we have no proposals to read out," the official said. a frustrated kerry called on thursday for "immediate" and "significant" action from russia and syria to prove their commitment to a ceasefire agreement reached this month. "we can't be the only ones trying to hold this door open," the us secretary of state said. "russia and the (bashar al-assad) regime must do their part." otherwise, kerry said, there's "no chance" for the process to continue. addressing the media from a podium at the palace hotel in new york, where he is attending the united nations general assembly, kerry opened by noting reports of a regime offensive in aleppo, which he said is "exactly the kind of regime action that has done so much damage to this process and to the credibility of the concept of restraint or cease fire." "obviously no one can possibly be satisfied with the events that have unfolded in the last few days," kerry said. "far, far from it." "absent a major gesture, we don't believe there is a point in making more promises," he insisted, suggesting the us was on the verge of scrapping the agreement if it didn't see a cessation of air activities by the russian and syrian militaries, or similarly concrete action. but kerry insisted the us is committed to seeking a resumption of the ceasefire and would be meeting with lavrov and member nations of the international syria support group in the coming days. "we remain absolutely convinced there is no such thing as a military solution," kerry said. a senior administration official told reporters in a conference call that russia would need to take "extraordinary steps" to get the process back on track. "we are not sure at this point whether they are ready and willing to take those kinds of steps." after the meeting with kerry on friday, lavrov addressed the united nations general assembly, saying diplomatic discussions on syria must be restarted "without any preconditions." but lavrov blamed the disruption of the agreement on "sabotage" by "specific people from abroad with their mentors and supporters," seemingly a rebuke of the united states and its coalition partners. russia believes "the reason lies in an attempt to try to change the regime," lavrov added. cnn's ryan browne contributed to this report.      kerry demands 'immediate action' from russia and syria on ceasefire      
__label__0 (cnn)as donald trump and hillary clinton prepare to square off monday night in their first debate, the expectations are clear: political bloodsport in primetime. the 2016 race has been notably nasty, with trump assuming the attack dog role campaigns have traditionally outsourced to running mates and surly surrogates. clinton too has shown a willingness to blitz trump -- though in less graphic terms -- during speeches and interviews on the trail. but does the current election season represent a new low in american politics? history says no -- and a group of historians interviewed by cnn agree. exhibit a: "that hideous hermaphroditical character, which has neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman." exhibit b: "around him, as the candidate for the highest office in the gift of the people, the most corrupt, the most designing and the most dangerous of the community rally." exhibit c: "we are republicans, and don't propose to leave our party and identify ourselves with the party whose antecedents have been rum, romanism, and rebellion." presidential candidates, their campaigns and supporters have been slinging mud since the founding fathers were jockeying for power in the aftermath of the revolution. the contests of the 19th century routinely descended into cesspools of public deviance, racism, and religious and personal slander. "the machinations, the backstabbing, the hideous caricatures and slurs were just devastating," historian joan waugh told cnn. "it was a bloodsport," she said. "i have to laugh, when i'm not weeping, at the utter abysmal ignorance of the way that politics and the history of politics is often reported. as if nothing today has ever happened before." 1800: 'that hideous hermaphroditical character' the first race of the new century was a rematch of the 1796 contest, pitting president john adams, a federalist, against thomas jefferson. in american politics in those early days, the parties were less important and the candidates didn't campaign much in person, mostly allowing partisan allies and hired hands to do the dirty work. and there was none more foul than jeffersonian hatchet man james t. callender. in a pamphlet titled, "the prospect before us," the scottish immigrant described adams as a "hideous hermaphroditical character, which has neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman." (for his trouble, callender would eventually be convicted of violating the sedition act and jailed, only to be freed when jefferson took office.) candidates in this era operated under both social and statutory constraints. it was considered unseemly to seek votes or speak ill of the opposition. and the sedition act made it illegal to write or print anything "malicious" about the government -- especially its president. "famously, when a guy in a bar, half-drunk, said that john adams had a fat ass -- which is also factually true -- the guy was put in jail," pulitzer prize-winning historian edward j. larson told cnn. "so you had to watch what you said directly about adams. you could get away with saying anything you wanted about others in the federalist party." while the jeffersonians feared adams was fixing to dispense with the american experiment in favor of something like the british monarchy, the federalists were equally convinced that jefferson would effectively open the borders to foreign radicals and clamp down on religion. as one massachusetts newspaper put it, electing "the infidel jefferson" would mean "our churches will be prostrated, and some infamous prostitute, under the title of the goddess of reason, will preside in the sanctuaries now devoted to the worship of the most high." of course, none of it was true. "jefferson was not an atheist," larson explained. in fact, the virginian and adams "had almost identical religious viewpoints. they were both unitarians. adams' religious viewpoints were almost indistinguishable from jefferson's and they knew that. they had been close friends." their relationship would last another quarter century, until they died on the same day -- july 4, 1826. 1828: 'the skunks of party slander' in the first -- but not final -- american campaign drama widely considered to have sent one of its central characters to an early grave, another incumbent adams was defeated in an electoral rematch from four years earlier. like in 1800, the 1824 contest had gone to the house of representatives. john quincy adams fared better than his father, winning the presidency over andrew jackson by obtaining the support of house speaker henry clay in what opponents called the "corrupt bargain" -- adams would name clay his secretary of state. this did not sit well with jackson, a hard-bitten man who was orphaned as a teen and made his name in combat against the british and then by leading a violent campaign against native american tribes. he would spend the next four years plotting his revenge. "the campaign of 1828 was very nasty, a campaign in which supporters of andrew jackson called john quincy adams a 'pimp' (the rumor, started by jackson allies, was that adams during his time as the us minister to russia had provided female companionship for the czar) and supporters of john quincy called jackson and his wife 'polygamists' because they had married before her divorce came through," said cnn presidential historian tim naftali. kerwin swint, an author and professor at kennesaw state university, recalled it being particularly hard on the jackson family. "andrew jackson's mother was caricatured as a common prostitute that the sailors brought over for the benefit of the english navy," he said, while jackson himself "was called a murderer, a traitor, and mentally unstable." adams dismissed the vile tone of the campaign, chalking up the slurs to those "skunks of party slander." the president, though, was not so high-minded that his associates didn't accuse jackson of being illiterate, while mocking his poor spelling skills and keeping up attacks on his wife, rachel. the harsh spotlight wore on her and, as many historians agree and jackson then believed, probably had a hand in killing her. "i would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of god than live in that palace in washington," she is said to have told friends as the campaign turned ugly. rachel jackson died on dec. 22, 1828, likely of a heart attack. she would be buried on christmas eve, before her husband's inauguration. at her funeral, andrew jackson is widely reported to have told fellow mourners, "i can and do forgive all my enemies. but those vile wretches who have slandered her must look to god for mercy." her tombstone at the hermitage, jackson's home in nashville, read in part: "a being so gentle, and yet so virtuous, slander might wound but could not dishonour." 1860: 'stephen in search of his mother' "at political rallies in (abraham) lincoln's era, people got drunk, they had fist fights, they threw excrement, they attacked horses, they screamed and shouted and cursed -- did i mention they drank; they drank a lot -- and it was not exactly a festive atmosphere," the historian and lincoln scholar harold holzer told cnn. "it was a scary atmosphere." in the years before the public flocked to see heavyweights in the ring or on the gridiron, many would bring their booze and off-hours aggressions to campaign rallies -- drunken parades and parties that made little mention of the candidates, who rarely if ever attended. lincoln in particular steered clear of the trail, as outright campaigning was still considered unbecoming of a future chief executive. so when one of the four candidates in the 1860 race, the democrat stephen a. douglas, announced he was going to travel from chicago to new hampshire, by way of new orleans, to visit his sick mother, political opponents and the partisan press drew their daggers. "douglas made a speech every time the train stopped for water and coal," holzer said. and for that, "he was mocked brutally as a momma's boy, as 'little steven in search of his mother,' insulting his independence, his manhood, making him look like a pipsqueak -- which he was -- so he was personally assailed." the broader sweep of the 1860 campaign was much darker. conspiracy theories and race hate were the prevailing the themes in a four-way showdown that left the democratic party in shambles and cleared the way for the first shots of the civil war just a few months later. the table had been set by a supreme court decision three years earlier, in 1857's dred scott decision, when it declared that african americans could not be us citizens. the ruling aggravated tensions between the northern and southern states, leading many to believe that, as holzer put it, "douglas was in cahoots with president james buchanan and chief justice taney to make slavery legal, national, and perpetual." this was not quite true. douglas despised buchanan and considered the scott decision a political misstep. but honest abe knew how to throw an elbow and seized on anxieties in the north over a federal government conspiring to expand slavery across the continent. douglas tried to turn the tables, as holzer explained, by saying "that lincoln wants whites to be able to marry blacks, blacks to serve on juries, blacks to have equal rights, blacks to have the vote, blacks to have white servants and all these things that are supposed to send shivers of horror into the white community." the political cartoons of the day helped stoke the fiction. appearing mostly on pamphlets and in saloon windows, they were often crude and deeply racist. in one titled "the political quadrille: music by dred scott" (above), all four candidates danced with their perceived objects of their interest -- lincoln with a black woman, john c. breckinridge with president buchanan (or "buck" the goat here), douglas with an irishman and constitutional union party candidate john bell, with a native american, suggesting that he is a nativist, or anti-immigrant. lincoln would rout all three, winning the presidency with 1.87 million votes, nearly 500,000 better than the runner-up douglas. but less than two months after the election, south carolina voted to secede from the union. six more states would follow before lincoln was sworn in as the 16th president of a rapidly dissolving united states on march 4, 1861. 1872: 'the home stretch' the second post-civil war election pitted president ulysses s. grant against a challenger from within his own party: the audacious abolitionist and new york tribune publisher horace greeley. the 1872 campaign turned on the fight over reconstruction in the south and with the democratic party still hopelessly divided, the liberal republicans -- a breakaway gop group that favored amnesty for erstwhile confederates -- formed the base of the electoral opposition. but as the campaign neared, they faced one minor hurdle: no one wanted their nomination. enter greeley, "a very strange and eccentric figure" by historian waugh's account. "he always wore this long white waistcoat and his hair was a mess." "he was no one's idea of their standard-bearer," waugh added, but that he would be -- and with it, the target of relentless attacks by his former friends and the cartoonist thomas nast. greeley became a figure of fun early on, and unflattering caricatures, in essay or cartoon form, followed him throughout the campaign. the press behaved like a band of cruel teenagers, wondering aloud -- as in one evening post editorial -- "how many men are there of character and reputation who may be counted among his friends? if there be any at all, they are very few -- so few that it is difficult to recall their names." rallying around him instead, the piece continued, were "the most corrupt, the most designing and the most dangerous of the community." "they accused greeley of all kinds of really whacko things," swint said. "he was a vegetarian, which was seen as weird. horace greeley today would be a new age guru kind of character. he was also easy to lampoon. he had a large puffy face, and big steel-rimmed glasses." in a pamphlet titled "horace greeley unmasked," springfield republican writer samuel bowles is quoted suggesting the candidate's "perversity of temper and openness to flattery" made him an easy mark for treacherous operators. greeley also suffered at the nimble hand of nast, the harper's weekly cartoonist, who skewered the candidate savagely for months. in his now infamous illustration, "we are on the home stretch," a waylaid greeley is seen, belly up, on a stretcher, defeated and being returned home to his home in chappaqua, new york. the drawing would prove dramatically prescient. at the end of october, days before the election and a week after the cartoon was published, greeley's wife died of consumption. her husband would follow her to the grave a month later, on november 29, before the electoral college could fully register his votes. 1884: 'ma, ma, where's my pa?' the called him "grover the good." but for all the work grover cleveland did in cleaning up corruption during his time as the sheriff of erie county, mayor of buffalo and governor of new york, the democrats' nominee in 1884 led a less tidy personal life. a brief relationship with the widowed maria halpin in the early 1870s had yielded a child, but hardly a father. "it became the story of the day, glorified through the media. there was no smoking gun or direct testimony, all they had were accusations and circumstances. and of course he did know halpin, and she named her son, his last name, cleveland," swint said. "he did admit to having an affair with her" and paid some child support. the republicans took aim, calling cleveland a deadbeat dad while dragging halpin and the child into the muck. "there is a famous cartoon (above) of cleveland walking down the street and a woman carrying a baby saying, 'ma, ma, where's my pa?,'" swint said. "so a lot of was visual. in the days before tv advertising, photos and illustrations in newspapers (carried more weight)." the rhyme took hold and became a rallying cry for supporters of cleveland's opponent, james g. blaine, who sang it in the streets and during campaign events. unfortunately for blaine, where cleveland's issues were mostly the stuff of gossip, the republican's own misdeeds well-documented -- literally. during his time as speaker of the house from 1869 to 1875, blaine had in a series of letters articulated the precise details of his self-dealing, which mostly included pushing laws to benefit the railroad companies who, in turn, dished him stock in their growing operations. one particular missive was marked with the now familiar request, "burn this letter!" the recipient failed to meet the request and the nominee was soon being taunted by cleveland supporters as "blaine, blaine, james g. blaine, the continental liar from the state of maine!" as one cleveland backer rationalized, the candidates' personal and professional failings, respectively, had made the choice an easy one. "we are told that mr. blaine has been delinquent in office but blameless in public life, while mr. cleveland has been a model of official integrity but culpable in personal relations," the supporter said. "we should therefore elect mr. cleveland to the public office for which he is so well qualified to fill, and remand mr. blaine to the private station which he is admirably fitted to adorn." it would get worse for blaine, who ran into more recognizable trouble when one of his allies in new york, the rev. samuel burchard, introduced the candidate with an infamous assault on the irish community -- effectively calling them drunks and, in what many considered an insult then, catholics. "we are republicans," he said, "and don't propose to leave our party and identify ourselves with the party whose antecedents have been rum, romanism, and rebellion." blaine did not utter a word of protest, his silence helping to solidify political antipathies that endure to the present day. cleveland would win a narrow popular vote but cruise to victory in the electoral college. his supporters did not disappoint either, finally returning the "ma, ma, where's my pa?" chant with a sharp answer: "gone to the white house, ha ha ha!"       trump-clinton nasty? not compared to these campaigns

"that's a wonderful example of how we can delude ourselves into thinking that nothing really has to change," ayres recently told cnn's "party people" podcast hosts kevin madden and mary katherine ham. the north star opinion research political consultant pointed to an estimated 4.2 million white voters who participated in the 2008 elections but did not vote in 2012, when the gop nominee lost by 5 million votes nationally. "so if every single one of them had turned out and voted for mitt romney, he still would have lost. moreover, most of those white voters who didn't turn out were in deep red states -- places like west virginia and arkansas and oklahoma -- where the presidential campaign was never competitive and they saw no reason to go and vote." "you don't get bonus electoral college points for that," ham added. related: 2016: last call for working class whites? ayres, who worked with sens. marco rubio and lindsey graham as well as tennessee gov. bill haslam, warned that republicans are working with a "worn-out business model." "we need to adapt to the new america -- not by changing our principles -- but by applying those principles to a new kind of voter," ayres said. he suggested the party can broaden their electorate by targeting hispanic voters, citing the last republican president as a role model. "george w. bush set a great example for republican candidates, as do many republicans in texas who seem far more comfortable with hispanic voters and hispanic culture," ayres said, adding, "george bush spoke a version of spanish, kind of like he spoke a version of english." ayres said the bush campaign "reached out aggressively," making sure his operation advertised in spanish-language media. related: the anatomy of a white, working-class trump voter "despite what some republicans say, a republican candidate can do very well -- but you've got to try," ayres said. "just like any other group, you've got to reach out. you've got to go after them aggressively, and you've got to ask for their votes, and republican candidates with conservative principles can do very well in the hispanic community." to hear what ayres thinks gop senate candidates are doing right in distancing themselves from trump and what he thinks will happen in monday's debate, listen to cnn's "party people," a new podcast from cnn where a pair of conservative cnn contributors talk to influential voices about the future of conservative politics and the republican party. get cnn's "party people" podcast at cnn, stitcher, tuneinradio or itunes. related: gop policy guru: trump can't 'fake his way through 90 minutes'       republican pollster whit ayres: white voters aren't enough to win      
__label__0 washington (cnn)kix brooks, one half of the country music duo brooks and dunn, is not buying the gloom and doom expressed on the campaign trail about america's declining greatness -- often espoused by republican presidential nominee donald trump's campaign slogan, "make america great again." dierks bentley on donald trump and the country music vote "we've always been great, as far as i'm concerned," the country music artist, whose classic 2001 hit "only america" with ronnie dunn became an anthem for patriotism following the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, told cnn. "there's a lot of stuff that we can do better and there's a lot of stuff that we do better than anybody in the world, but that's life. that's our project as americans -- we always work to be better," he continued. but brooks, who considers himself to be "fairly conservative," is not optimistic that the next commander-in-chief will be able to make good on his or her promises to solve some of the country's most divisive issues if washington remains gridlocked and the us continues to be as "polarized" as it is today. democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton has promised to work with congress to implement comprehensive immigration reform and pledged to take on the gun lobby to institute "common sense" gun-control measures. meanwhile, trump has promised to build a wall on the southern border between the us and mexico. check out: #getpolitical — a cnn politics original series "i think all the issues that are on the table, from gun control to immigration, are so complicated, there is no easy answer," brooks told cnn. "none of these problems are going to be solved overnight or probably in the next four years no matter what either candidate says." on gun culture lamenting the hostility that has often plagued the gun-control debate on both sides, the "boot scootin' boogie" artist said that the right to bear arms is an american principle that "should be respected." "we do have a second amendment and it's something that should be respected and discussed in a civilized way," brooks said. "my only concerns are that second amendment rights are discussed with so much ferocity that sometimes we don't hear what each other is saying." brooks, who is an avid hunter, grew up in shreveport, louisiana, along the red river, and as he toured the country to play music over the last two decades, he witnessed a stark cultural divide between rural and urban america when it comes to guns. while americans in rural america "never considered what a gang was," brooks said, those in urban america also don't understand that "having a shotgun in the back of your pick up truck was also just a way of life" for americans like him. brooks is a strong supporter of states' rights and said that gun-control solutions to address gang violence and gun violence in american cities are not necessarily needed or effective in rural america. "i don't feel like what's good for california is good for tennessee, is good for louisiana, is good for new york city," brooks said," adding, that local "leaders in our own communities know much better what our problems are and how we should deal with them than washington, d.c., does." and as for election 2016, brooks did not say who he is voting for but said if he hears a candidate speaking along those lines, he tends "to listen more closely." on 'only in america' many artists have protested when politicians with views they oppose use their songs during campaign events. however, when then-democratic presidential nominee barack obama played brooks and dunn's "only in america" at the 2008 democratic national convention, that was not the case. "seems ironic that the same song bush used at the republican convention last election would be used by obama and the democrats now," brooks said at the time. "very flattering to know our song crossed parties and potentially inspires all americans." brooks, who was a supporter of president george w. bush, said that he co-wrote "only in america" with his friend and music producer don cook -- a democrat -- after they spent day in the woods, riding four-wheelers near brooks' farm and talking about how grateful they are to be americans. "the song was never meant to be political in any way. it still isn't," brooks said. "the song is patriotic ... call it corny or flag-waving or whatever you want to, but i'm really sincere about it. it means a lot to me -- our country does and everything it stands for."       brooks and dunn's kix brooks gets political: america has 'always been great'      
__label__0 (cnn)aaron sorkin could be earning royalties off the 2016 campaign. "the west wing" creator's storylines are proving remarkably prescient in the epic donald trump-hillary clinton white house battle. a democratic campaign grappling with a health crisis? check. (see hillary clinton's pneumonia and jed bartlet's far more serious multiple sclerosis). gaffes by politicians that conveniently help their cause? there, too, this year. a soon-to-be nominee iffy at best about his running mate? that happened on the nbc drama as well. the similarities are poised to cross into reality this weekend when most of the series' cast members will campaign for hillary clinton in ohio. there's a certain irony to this, as many series plotlines about the white house of fictional commander in chief, bartlet (martin sheen), were based on events from bill clinton's administration. "the west wing" premiered with about 14 months left in bill clinton's presidency, and a swath of his former aides worked on the show as writers and producers. so in the already "west wing"-tinged 2016 campaign, what's next in made-for-television events? five episodes offer clues. unhealthy secrecy bartlet is depicted in the series as an exemplar of virtue, both in public and private realms. a nobel prize-winning economist and former new hampshire governor, he earnestly wrestles with public policy decisions based largely on his progressive principles. bartlet is a devout catholic and father of three daughters seemingly without hint of personal scandal. but he's not infallible. it's revealed midway in the first season that bartlet has been hiding a years-ago diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. and he had full complicity from his physician wife abby (stockard channing), who delivered shots of a mitigating drug, betaseron. the secret is so closely-held that the bartlets initially keep it from the candidate/president's close friend, leo mcgarry (john spencer) -- who convinced bartlet to seek the white house in the first place. mcgarry is eventually let in on it after the president collapses in the oval office. but the trio keeps white house senior staff members in the dark for more than a year. a miniature version of this drama recently played out in the 2016 campaign, although over a considerably less serious medical issue for clinton. compared to bartlet's years-long conspiracy of silence over a potentially life-threatening condition, for only two days she neglected to inform the public about a common health concern, pneumonia, from which she quickly recovered, according to medical information provided by her campaign. clinton in september was slow to reveal the pneumonia diagnosis, after a spate of coughing fits during a speech and on her campaign plane. and she doesn't appear to have informed many of her top aides about it. her doctor revealed the candidate's pneumonia diagnosis on the afternoon of sunday, september 11, through her campaign. but that was two days late, and only after the democratic nominee stumbled and exited a 9/11 commemoration ceremony early -- in full public view. many people even inside the clinton campaign did not know about the pneumonia diagnosis. an aide said that clinton "thought she could push through this ... she was feeling better" -- until that sunday morning. in both cases, neither politician actually presented false information to the public. "nobody lied," an exasperated mcgarry says tells white house communications director toby ziegler (richard schiff), during one one particularly dramatic "west wing" scene. political 'gaffes'? riffing at a campaign fundraiser in new york on september 8, hillary clinton veered into seemingly dangerous political territory. "to just be grossly generalistic, you can put half of trump supporters into what i call the basket of deplorables," clinton said. "right? racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, islamophobic, you name it." clinton then said some of these people were "irredeemable" and "not america." predictable outrage soon followed from the trump campaign and supporters. clinton -- kind of -- walked it back. "i regret saying 'half' -- that was wrong," she said in a statement in which she also vowed to call out "bigotry" in trump's campaign. the episode seemed like the self-inflicted wound of clinton's political career. she insulted a broad swath of the electorate, and gave her opponents an opening to play victim of mean-spirited attacks. but her "deplorables" jab at trump voters had another effect -- it put trump and allies on the defense to show its campaign supporters weren't racist. in doing so, it stirred a lively -- and ongoing -- conversation about some of the more controversial elements of the trump coalition. in other words, clinton set the terms of argument -- and potentially helped rally her democratic base. the incident called to mind a similar bartlet "gaffe" made in the course of a heated presidential race, which ended up helping his cause. in a 2002 episode, bartlet is caught on camera "accidentally" questioning the intelligence of his gop opponent, florida gov. rob ritchie. after touting his administration's energy plan, he disparages his rival -- a thinly-veiled george w. bush stand-in -- as a ".22 caliber mind in a .357 magnum world." for days, the bartlet white house is on the defensive for an unsportsmanlike insult at a campaign rival. but it turns out bartlet's blunder was anything but. the errant comment triggers waves of coverage about his rival's smarts -- or lack thereof -- while raising awareness about the energy proposal. "it didn't turn out too bad at all," white house press secretary c.j. cregg (allison janney) muses to bartlet in the episode's closing scene. "in fact, the whole country's talking about whether ritchie's smart enough to be president. and you didn't take a hit, because it was an accident." party crashers when trump entered the 2016 gop primary race, he faced a wall of establishment-type pols -- marco rubio, john kasich and many more. he beat them all. jed bartlet, too, was an outsider candidate who shocked the political establishment. he started out far behind texas sen. john hoynes (tim matheson), but his populist message eventually overtook his democratic rivals. bartlet at times shows existential angst over his place in the party firmament. notably in the season 2 finale "two cathedrals," he ponders whether to run for re-election after a primetime news conference revealing his ms condition, and juggling several crises, foreign and domestic. in a dream sequence with his recently-deceased secretary, a big-sister-like figure for decades, bartlet observes, "i've got a secret for you, mrs. landingham: i've never been the most popular guy in the democratic party." trump, though, has shown no such self-reflection. he routinely boasts of beating out 16 gop primary rivals. as ms. landingham predicted would happen for bartlet and the democrats, the republican national committee and party apparatus have rallied around trump. you can't always get what you want a recurring "west wing" subplot depicts long-simmering tension between bartlet and his vice president, the past primary rival. a more conservative democrat, hoynes was a one-time favorite for the party nod who ultimately lost to the upstart granite state challenger. bartlet put hoynes on the ticket out of necessity to win southern states -- a new england-texas alliance reminiscent of john f. kennedy tapping lyndon johnson as his running mate in 1960. both odd-couple tickets led to transactional relationships at best. lbj was famously cut out of kennedy's inner circle. "west wing's" hoynes is seen repeating trying to undercut the president. in fact, it's a hoynes new hampshire trip that forces bartlet's hand into revealing the president's ms condition. in 2016, republican nominee trump isn't on such fraught terms with his running mate, indiana gov. mike pence. outwardly, they seem cordial enough, with pence playing the good solider, dutifully defending trump's many controversial remarks. but it's no love affair, either. in searching for an understudy, trump over the summer reportedly narrowed his search to three finalists -- pence, new jersey gov. chris christie and former house speaker newt gingrich. trump finally went with pence. but he was so unenthusiastic about it that the night before the campaign's scheduled announcement he frantically called advisers and friends about how to reverse the decision. by that time, pence was already ensconced in a new york hotel room, with the full expectation that he would be announced as trump's choice. it was simply too late for a change. but a less-than-subtle signal about trump's feelings came the next day when he spent a full 30 minutes talking before letting his running mate have a few words at the microphone. the trump campaign rally theme song that then blared -- "you can't always get what you want" by the rolling stones -- seemed particularly apt for the moment. the lawsuit election clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state has led to a series of ongoing headaches in her 2016 campaign. while let off the hook by the fbi about whether she improperly dealt with classified material on an unprotected network, conservative critics are still on her case. and one group, judicial watch, has drawn a measure of political blood. the group filed a freedom of information act lawsuit against the state department in 2015, and in august, it released 296 pages of emails from the democratic presidential nominee -- including 44 that judicial watch says were not previously handed over to the state department by clinton. the emails, many of which are heavily redacted, raise questions about the clinton foundation's influence on the state department and its relations during her tenure. in one instance, top clinton foundation official doug band lobbied clinton aides for a job for someone else in the state department. in the email, band tells hillary clinton's former aides at the department -- cheryl mills and huma abedin -- that it is "important to take care of (redacted)." band is reassured by abedin that "personnel has been sending him options." the revelations haven't derailed clinton's campaign -- but they weren't helpful, either. and the documents recall an early "west wing" story arc including a conservative legal group, "freedom watch," which forces bartlet administration senior staff members to testify in depositions about alleged white house drug use. the group's target is mcgarry, a recovering drug addict and alcoholic. freedom watch obtains supposedly-private records from mcgarry's treatment center. it forces mcgarry, a former labor secretary, into an embarrassing public admission. even during "west wing's" original run, freedom watch looked familiar. the fictionalized conservative watchdog group was, not surprisingly, based on judicial watch. the real life group has a long history with the clintons, having filed lawsuits over 1990s-era controversies like the vince foster suicide.       how 2016 is like 'the west wing'      
__label__0 (cnn)hillary clinton holds a solid 6-point lead over donald trump heading into the first presidential debate next monday, according to a new national poll released friday. the mcclatchy-marist poll found clinton leading trump 45% to 39% among likely voters in a four-way race. libertarian gary johnson garnered 10% support, and green party candidate jill stein polled at 4%. a wall street journal/nbc poll this week found clinton leading by a similar margin, 43% to 37%. clinton maintains a massive lead among black voters in the new poll, pacing trump 93% to 3% despite high-profile efforts by the trump campaign to improve its outreach to minority voters. clinton also has a large advantage over trump among latinos, 74% to 16%, but her support shrinks to 60% when third-party options are included. both candidates continue to struggle with low favorability numbers -- 40% of likely voters say they have a favorable opinion of clinton, and 37% say the same about trump. trump has a slight edge on the question of who is "honest and trustworthy," as 44% of likely voters think he is, while 36% think that clinton is. the two run about even when voters pick who "shares their values" and who "cares about people like them." and clinton beats trump handily on "know how to do the job" and temperament. with the candidates' health on the minds of voters following clinton's pneumonia diagnosis earlier this month, respondents were asked who has more stamina to be president -- 53% said that trump does, while just 39% said the same of clinton. voters gave clinton the edge over trump on a series of key issues. on terrorism (52% to 41%), immigration (54% to 41%), creating good jobs (49% to 43%) and trade (52% to 42%), clinton is viewed as the better candidate. the mcclatchy-marist poll was conducted through september 15 to 20, and surveyed 758 likely voters. it has a margin of error of +/- 3.6 points.       national poll: clinton leads trump by 6 ahead of debate      
__label__0 london (cnn)flag-waving us political activists took to the streets of london this week in a "stop trump" battle bus to urge fellow american expats in the uk to register and vote against the republican presidential nominee. waving placards as they drove the red, open-top, double-decker past the palace of westminster and st. paul's cathedral, the campaigners urged the estimated 200,000 us citizens in britain to register to vote in the election on november 8. they stopped off at key american hotspots in the city, including the american school, the city of london financial hub and a popular philly cheesesteak food truck in spitalfields, east london. the event was organized by avaaz -- a global "people-powered politics" group based in london that provided ipads for us citizens to register for the vote online at the various stops along the bus route. and they tried to attract participation by handing out cookies and blaring american music by johnny cash and others from the speakers. "millions of americans live abroad," the group said in a facebook post. "they could stop trump from taking over the white house, but only 12 per cent of them vote. this is where we come in." around 20 campaigners chanted anti-trump slogans from the bus and called on us citizens to pick democratic candidate hillary clinton. brooklyn native dana lazarus-cass, 55, who has lived in london for 30 years, said she was going to vote democrat to counter what she considers trump's isolationist campaign. "i think americans who live abroad have a different perspective," she said. "we have a broader view of the world and america's standing in it." amanda jones, 27, from colorado, also said she was voting for clinton. pressed on the former secretary of state's policies, jones seemed mostly motivated by opposition to trump. james toles, also 27, is traveling through europe and has already registered to vote. the new yorker told cnn, "people who are following trump, i don't think they even know his politics beyond the (mexican) border wall, which is absolutely ridiculous." avaaz's campaign director was pleased with the result of wednesday's efforts. "today went really well. we had an amazing reception from the general public, waving and cheering at the bus as we drove through london," meredith alexander told cnn. "they clearly feel the same way as we do about the threat trump poses to our world. we had over 50 us expats come on the bus and register to vote." the trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. the liberty cheesesteak truck -- which sells the famous rolls packed with grilled cheese and meat -- is run by jp teti, who moved to london from his home in philadelphia eight years ago with his wife. the upcoming election dominates the conversations for us expats who queue up liberty cheesesteak truck in spitalfields. teti said that he isn't voting for either clinton or trump, however. "i think that there are certainly talented people in our country and we could put up better choices for leader of our country," he responded. "most americans would like to see that." avaaz is planning similar initiatives in berlin friday and mexico city sunday. in berlin, activists intend to demolish a 2.5-meter-high (8.2 feet) wall with an image of trump painted on it. invited to comment on the event, kate andrews, a spokesperson for republicans overseas uk, said registering americans to vote was an important cause. "we would encourage all americans abroad, here in the uk and globally, to register to vote," she said. "regardless of who one casts their vote for in this election cycle, republicans overseas uk remains a voice for all expats who support liberty and constitutional values." the organization has not hosted any rallies in the uk for mr. trump yet and said reliable polling on how much support he has had not been conducted, but andrews did point to some of the group's upcoming events of its own: "we plan to host some upcoming breakfasts around the later debates."

"it is an american story, the american story," the new york democrat told cnn's alisyn camerota on "new day." "it's great for all americans when you go look at from the beginning of slavery in america to where we are today." "all americans get to see the progress and contributions that african americans made to this great country of ours," he added. president barack obama and first lady michelle obama are scheduled to attend saturday's opening ceremony where the president will give remarks. former president george w. bush and his wife, laura, are expected to attend as well. meeks said the museum will allow visitors to see america's effort to make strides in race issues. "i think that for generations yet unborn, people will then get to see the american story and the greatness of it as how it has evolved and continues to evolve in attempting to be a more perfect union," he said. related: obama says it would be 'personal insult' to legacy if black voters don't back clinton the congressman's comments about progress come the same week he spoke out about tension between black communities and law enforcement following the fatal shootings of two black men. terence crutcher was shot and killed last week in tulsa, oklahoma, after his car broke down. the 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before officer betty shelby fatally shot him. crutcher was unarmed at the time. meanwhile, multiple police officers and citizens have been injured in charlotte, north carolina, this week during protests after the fatal shooting of keith lamont scott by a police officer. police say scott was armed at the time he was fatally shot, but his family claims that he was reading a book in his vehicle when police officers approached and shot him. related: tulsa police officer charged with manslaughter meeks told camerota about wanting congress to pass laws providing more federal funding to train local law enforcement how to deescalate tense situations with citizens. "there are various bills that have already been written that we need to talk about. we need to have hearings on them and then vote them on the floor," meeks said. "for example, we have to fund more body cameras. because what we know is when you have a visual view of what's going on, it helps transparency. because an issue in a lot of cases is 'is this a matter of transparency?'" meeks was also part of a delegation that marched to the department of justice thursday to present attorney general loretta lynch with a letter demanding an investigation into the shootings. "we need the attorney general to act. we need her to act now," he said thursday at a news conference.

__label__0 (cnn)president barack obama sharply criticized republican presidential nominee donald trump for saying earlier this week that the black community is in the worst shape it's "ever been in before." "i think even most 8-year-olds will tell you that whole slavery thing wasn't very good for black people," obama told abc news in an interview that aired friday on "good morning america." "jim crow wasn't very good for black people. what we have to do is use our history to propel us to make even more progress in the future." obama's comments reflected the wide gulf between the president and trump that came into greater focus this week as race again became a top issue in the 2016 campaign following fatal police shootings of african-american men in oklahoma and north carolina. speaking before a mostly white audience tuesday in kenansville, north carolina, trump spoke of the need to "rebuild our inner cities." "our african-american communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before. ever. ever. ever," trump said. the speech was part of a high-profile push by the trump campaign to plug gaps in poll numbers with minority voters, and also to win over white voters turned off by divisive rhetoric from trump that critics have repeatedly labeled as racist. still, the effort has stumbled. by proposing the expansion of the controversial "stop-and-frisk" program as a way to improve urban policing -- and by engaging in a public re-litigation of the baseless "birther" controversy that critics labeled racist -- trump spent much of the last week doing damage control with the same voters he'd hoped to attract. all the while, obama has positioned himself as one of trump's most vocal critics -- and rival hillary clinton's biggest cheerleader. speaking to reporters gathered in the oval office last friday, obama sarcastically dismissed trump's "birther" capitulation. "i was pretty confident about where i was born, i think most people were as well," he said. "my hope would be the presidential election reflects more serious issues than that." and the president made a more earnest effort to rebut trump when he spoke at the congressional black caucus gala on saturday, and said that he would consider it a "personal insult" to his legacy if black voters didn't turn out for clinton. newest absentee, registration numbers promising for clinton "if i hear anybody saying their vote does not matter, that it doesn't matter who we elect -- read up on your history. it matters. we've got to get people to vote," obama said. "i will consider it a personal insult -- an insult to my legacy -- if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. you want to give me a good sendoff? go vote." at the event, obama also criticized trump for using hyperbolic language when discussing african-americans, and suggested that trump visit the smithsonian's new national museum of african american history and culture for perspective. "you may have heard hillary's opponent in this election say that there's never been a worse time to be a black person. i mean, he missed that whole civics lesson about slavery or jim crow," he said. "but we've got a museum for him to visit, so he can tune in. we will educate him." obama speaks at the museum's opening friday.       obama on trump: 'even most 8-year-olds' know slavery was a bad time for black people      
__label__0 washington (cnn)charlotte mayor jennifer roberts said republican nominee donald trump's assumption that drugs are a factor in her city's protests is "presumptuous." "it's presumptuous for him to make conclusions like that without having thorough conversations with some of the folks who are here on the ground and are really aware of what's going on and what the reasoning is," she told cnn's carol costello on "newsroom." multiple police officers and citizens have been injured this week during protests after the fatal shooting of keith lamont scott by a police officer. charlotte police say scott was armed at the time he was fatally shot, but his family said he was reading a book in his vehicle when police officers approached and shot him. trump tied the eruption of violent protests to narcotics, telling a pittsburgh crowd wednesday that "drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night." the gop nominee offered no evidence to back up that claim but steven cheung, a trump campaign spokesman, later said it was "obvious" that trump was "referring to the recent increase in drug related deaths and subsequent news reports, thus making it a hot button issue." but roberts said she and charlotte council members have been in conversations all week with protestors about their motivations. "we have a much better understanding than mr. trump," she told costello. roberts said frustration with racial inequality throughout charlotte and the country as a whole over issues such as education, economic development and social justice are the impetus behind the protests.

__label__0 (cnn)donald trump is expanding the list of individuals he would consider naming to the supreme court, just days before the first presidential debate, in what appears to be his latest effort to shore up republican and minority support. trump's latest additions put a sitting republican senator who isn't supporting trump and three non-white judges onto trump's list of potential supreme court nominees, bringing the list to 21 names from the previous 10. the list, which trump is set to release later friday, includes: sen. mike lee of utah, us court of appeals judge margaret ryan, iowa supreme court justice edward mansfield, george supreme court justice keith blackwell, florida supreme court justice charles candy, us court of appeals chief judge timothy tymkovich, us district court judge amul thapar, us district court judge federico moreno and michigan supreme court chief justice robert young. a trump campaign aide confirmed the list, which was first reported friday morning by nbc news. the unusual move to release a list, rather than simply naming the kinds of justices he would seek to nominate, as nearly all presidential nominees, including his rival hillary clinton, have done, is part of his efforts to reassure conservatives in his candidacy. trump has repeatedly reminded conservatives wary of his candidacy of the importance of the president's power to fill supreme court vacancies in the wake of justice antonin scalia's death earlier this year and as two justices on the bench are now over 80 years old. trump's latest additions appear to be continuing reassurance to conservatives. "donald trump continues to take unprecedented steps to demonstrate that he intends to appoint justices like scalia, thomas, and alito. conservatives should be very pleased by the steps he has taken, and if he lives up to his promises we will have a court that truly puts the rule of law ahead of political preferences," said carrie severino, of the conservative judicial crisis network. mike lee: thanks, but no thanks trump's pick of lee, the utah senator who is one of the last remaining trump holdouts among senate republicans, appears to be a bid to gain not just lee's support but also that of sen. ted cruz, the texas republican who fought trump for the gop nomination until may and refused to endorse him during his speech at the republican national convention in july. cruz has continued to resist entreaties to endorse the republican nominee, but he did meet last week with indiana gov. mike pence, trump's running mate. cruz's spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment. lee, meanwhile, isn't biting. "sen. lee already has the job he wants which is why he is campaigning to represent the great people of utah again this year. this new list does not change sen. lee's mind about trump in any way whatsoever," lee spokesman conn caroll said in a statement. lee's brother, an associate justice on the utah supreme court, was listed in trump's initial batch of 11 potential supreme court picks. previous list was all-white trump's list also brings diversity to his previous all-white cast of potential supreme court picks, just as trump has ramped up his efforts in the last month to appeal to minority voters -- many of whom he has offended during his presidential campaign. thapar, a us district court judge, was the first south asian to be named to an article iii federal judgeship in 2007. moreno, who serves on the district court for the southern district of florida, is hispanic and was born in venezuela. and robert young, the michigan supreme court's chief justice, is african-american. trump also added a military veteran to his list by naming ryan, a judge on the us court of appeals for the armed forces, as another potential pick.       trump floats more potential supreme court picks — including sen. mike lee      
__label__0 washington (cnn)he may want to be "mr. president," but donald trump has a back-up title: "saint donald." at least according to bobby knight. the legendary basketball coach, himself known as "the general," has been using the phrase to describe the gop candidate in recent days as he campaigns for him. "i actually enjoyed the day with 'saint donald,' and i've enjoyed watching him," knight said on "fox and friends" on friday. "i think the man has a lot of really, really good things to bring to the table." it's an honorific knight has been quick to use in recent days. he also called trump "saint donald" during a campaign stop in chester township, pennsylvania, on thursday and in another interview with fox news on thursday. trump-clinton nasty? not compared to these campaigns asked about elevating trump to sainthood, knight says that's what he thinks of the real-estate mogul. "well, in my mind, i do just to kind of let him know that," he said, with host jenna lee interjecting that it was a sign of "affection." leaving trump tower on friday, knight said it's all light-hearted. "i just kid him about that," knight told reporters. "i needle him about that. he's got a great sense of humor and i think that's another thing that he has that's gonna be good." knight said friday he's watched trump's style evolve since he first endorsed trump before the indiana primary and that he has been strong. "i just watch him, i think, become -- i don't know if the word 'mild' is the word to use or not, or 'milder.' but i just have seen him take a different approach to how things should be and to go about attacking things and what's wrong," knight said friday on fox. "i've really been impressed with the interest that he has in seeing that things are done in the right way." knight is famous for coaching the indiana hoosiers and is one of the winningest college basketball coaches of all time. he endorsed trump and campaigned with him before the candidate went on to the win the indiana primary, effectively sealing his nomination. but knight left coaching on controversial ground, after he as accused of physically and verbally abusing a student. knight was legendary for his temper as much as his wins. trump proudly touts the endorsement on the campaign trail, even when he is not appearing with knight.       that's 'saint donald' to bobby knight      
__label__0 (cnn)hillary clinton holds a solid 6-point lead over donald trump heading into the first presidential debate next monday, according to a new national poll released friday. the mcclatchy-marist poll found clinton leading trump 45% to 39% among likely voters in a four-way race. libertarian gary johnson garnered 10% support, and green party candidate jill stein polled at 4%. a wall street journal/nbc poll this week found clinton leading by a similar margin, 43% to 37%. clinton maintains a massive lead among black voters in the new poll, pacing trump 93% to 3% despite high-profile efforts by the trump campaign to improve its outreach to minority voters. clinton also has a large advantage over trump among latinos, 74% to 16%, but her support shrinks to 60% when third-party options are included. both candidates continue to struggle with low favorability numbers -- 40% of likely voters say they have a favorable opinion of clinton, and 37% say the same about trump. trump has a slight edge on the question of who is "honest and trustworthy," as 44% of likely voters think he is, while 36% think that clinton is. the two run about even when voters pick who "shares their values" and who "cares about people like them." and clinton beats trump handily on "know how to do the job" and temperament. with the candidates' health on the minds of voters following clinton's pneumonia diagnosis earlier this month, respondents were asked who has more stamina to be president -- 53% said that trump does, while just 39% said the same of clinton. voters gave clinton the edge over trump on a series of key issues. on terrorism (52% to 41%), immigration (54% to 41%), creating good jobs (49% to 43%) and trade (52% to 42%), clinton is viewed as the better candidate. the mcclatchy-marist poll was conducted through september 15 to 20, and surveyed 758 likely voters. it has a margin of error of +/- 3.6 points.       national poll: clinton leads trump by 6 ahead of debate      
__label__0 washington (cnn)hillary clinton's top aide was given a limited immunity deal by the fbi in the investigation into clinton's private email server, according to congressional sources friday. cheryl mills, clinton's chief of staff and adviser at the state department, was given the narrow immunity deal during the fbi's investigation into the former secretary of state's use of a private email server during her time in office. "this is beyond explanation," rep. jason chaffetz said in a statement. "the fbi was handing out immunity agreements like candy. i've lost confidence in this investigation and i question the genuine effort in which it was carried out. immunity deals should not be a requirement for cooperating with the fbi." a spokeswoman for chaffetz, chairman of the house oversight committee, confirmed that mills was being given immunity. but a democratic congressional source said the extent of the deal was limited to a search of her and another aide's laptop. according to the source, the fbi requested the laptops of clinton's attorneys, mills and heather samuelson, after they conducted a 2014 review of what emails clinton sent were work-related and which were personal. work-related emails were turned over to the state department and personal emails were deleted. in exchange for giving the laptops they used to the fbi, mills and samuelson were given a limited immunity agreement from the department of justice, the democratic source said, that they would not face prosecution for any information that was found on those laptops. "the doj and fbi considered my clients to be witnesses and nothing more," said beth wilkinson, an attorney for mills. "indeed, the justice department assured us that they believed my clients did nothing wrong. at all points, my clients cooperated with the government's investigation, including voluntarily participating in interviews with the fbi and doj. "the letters released to the hill today only covered the computers that my clients had used in performing their legal work. because of the confusion surrounding the various agencies' positions on the after-the-fact classification decisions, i advised my clients to accept this letter from doj." a clinton campaign spokesman said friday's leak -- coming three days before the first presidential debate -- was politically motivated. "three days before debate, house gop selectively leaks details from inquiry that was closed months ago w/no charges," brian fallon tweeted. a 'criminal scheme' the fbi announced in july that it would not recommend any criminal charges in relation to its lengthy investigation of clinton's email use. fbi director james comey made the announcement in an unprecedented statement to reporters, during which he also excoriated clinton's staff for its carelessness, all while saying no criminal acts were prosecutable. first on cnn: fbi director defends clinton email probe, document releases since then, congressional republicans have called comey to testify and have demanded the fbi send its investigation materials for review. comey is appearing again on capitol hill, testifying before the house judiciary committee next wednesday. he is expected to face more questions from republicans about his handling of the clinton email probe. republican candidate donald trump seized on the news, with his spokesman saying it proves a "criminal scheme." "no one with judgment this bad should be allowed to serve as president of the united states or hold any public office," said spokesman jason miller. "in light of this development, hillary clinton must immediately come forward and promise the american people that none of these individuals will ever serve in any capacity in her administration." the democratic source, however, said that the immunity agreement was limited and that mills testified before congress and spoke with the fbi without invoking her fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. "mills was not given immunity for any testimony or statements she gave to doj. she gave voluntary statements to doj as she had previously to the benghazi committee," the source said. the top democrat on the oversight panel, rep. elijah cummings criticized republicans' response to the issue. "it's beyond disappointing—but not surprising in light of the election—that republicans are rushing to leak inaccurate information about this very limited agreement between ms. mills and the justice department," cummings said in an statement, and pointed to praise mills received from republicans for her participating in a nine-hour interview on the issue. an it staffer has also been given immunity in exchange for his testimony. mills is a former legal adviser to clinton's campaign, was her chief of staff at the state department and has served on the board of the clinton foundation. her time at the state department has been controversial both in terms of her handling of sensitive information via clinton's email server and in her connection to the clinton foundation. while chief of staff at state, mills traveled to new york on what her lawyer says was a volunteer basis to interview job candidates for the foundation, according to a cnn investigation. top house republicans ask doj to investigate whether clinton lied to congress cnn's david fitzpatrick contributed to this report.      cheryl mills got immunity in probe, congressman says

"the argument against the ticket is, i think, everybody knows that they're not going to win," kaine said of the gary johnson and bill weld libertarian ticket in an interview with yahoo news' katie couric this week. hillary clinton's running mate pointed to the 2000 election as evidence that a protest vote for a third-party candidate can affect the outcome of the race -- and history. related: gary johnson: running mate bill weld not dropping out "my argument against the (johnson-weld) ticket is the al gore-george w. bush race in 2000. the third party candidacy of ralph nader cost gore electoral votes in new hampshire and florida. and if gore had been president, we probably wouldn't had a war in iraq," he said. "casting a vote, a protest vote, for a third-party candidate that's going to lose may well affect the outcome. it may well lead to a consequence that is deeply, deeply troubling. that's not a speculation, we've seen it in our country's history." related: johnson, stein fail to qualify for first debate as the race tightens nationally and in key swing states, kaine cautioned against a protest vote, but acknowledged he and clinton need to make that case to voters who may be considering johnson. "we're going to make the affirmative case for hillary, we're going to draw the contrast with donald trump, but we're also going to tell people, the way you make a difference to your nation is not by doing a protest vote. it's picking the next leader of the country." related: national poll: clinton leads trump by 6 ahead of debate       tim kaine on libertarian ticket: 'everybody knows they're not going to win'      
__label__0 washington (cnn)ted cruz endorsed donald trump for the presidency friday afternoon, a stunning turn of events after a contentious primary filled with nasty personal attacks and a dramatic snub at the republican national convention. "after many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, i have decided that on election day, i will vote for the republican nominee, donald trump," cruz wrote in a facebook post. "a year ago, i pledged to endorse the republican nominee, and i am honoring that commitment. and if you don't want to see a hillary clinton presidency, i encourage you to vote for him." "i am greatly honored by the endorsement of senator cruz," trump said in a statement obtained by cnn. "we have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent. i look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make america great again." the move -- three days before trump's critical first debate with clinton -- comes as the trump and cruz camps have moved closer in recent weeks. trump's vice presidential nominee mike pence played a key role in bringing cruz into the fold. pence and cruz traded multiple messages, then spoke at length once on the phone and again in person, when pence visited capitol hill a few weeks ago, a source close to pence said. ted cruz fast facts trump has hired key cruz allies such as kellyanne conway as his campaign manager, and jason miller as a spokesman. wednesday, trump's campaign expressed support for a cruz-backed, internet-related proposal in government funding talks in the senate. friday, trump released a new list of conservative judges likely to appeal to the former supreme court clerk -- including perhaps cruz's closest friend in congress, utah sen. mike lee. cruz cited trump's pledges on the judiciary in his facebook post. "we know, without a doubt, that every clinton appointee would be a left-wing ideologue. trump, in contrast, has promised to appoint justices 'in the mold of (the late antonin) scalia,' cruz wrote. "for some time, i have been seeking greater specificity on this issue, and today the trump campaign provided that, releasing a very strong list of potential supreme court nominees — including sen. mike lee, who would make an extraordinary justice — and making an explicit commitment to nominate only from that list." a cruz endorsement could be the last pillar to helping trump shore up the support of conservatives who have remained reticent about supporting his campaign. trump has already gotten most republicans and conservatives on board with his campaign -- largely by reassuring them on the supreme court and on issues like the second amendment and abortion. but cruz's principled opposition to offering his support has given some conservatives high-profile cover. just as cruz's refusal to endorse trump at the rnc fueled democrats' efforts to paint trump as divisive even within his own party, cruz's endorsement will help undermine that narrative -- suggesting to conservatives unsure about trump that perhaps the brash billionaire has changed, and can be trusted to bring conservative change to washington. 'lyin' ted' and 'utterly amoral' the move marks a dramatic turnaround from the personal insults cruz and trump traded during the previous year. the two men clashed repeatedly during the primaries, as trump taunted the senator with the nickname "lyin' ted," suggested cruz wasn't eligible to be president due to his canadian birthplace, and even speculated that cruz's father was involved in the jfk assassination. trump also said cruz should "be careful" or he would "spill the beans on your wife," and retweeted an unflattering picture of heidi cruz. those tweets have not been deleted from trump's account. on his last day of the gop campaign -- the indiana primary in early may -- cruz let loose against trump, calling the businessman a "serial philanderer," "utterly amoral," and "a narcissist at a level i don't think this country's ever seen. at the rnc in cleveland, cruz gave a memorable speech espousing conservative values but ended without endorsing trump, as trump allies booed from the convention floor. "don't stay home in november," cruz said. "stand and speak and vote your conscience." the next day, he defended the move by citing trump's attacks against his family. "i'm not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father," cruz told members of the texas delegation. "that pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack heidi that i'm going to nonetheless come as a servile puppy dog and say, 'thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.'" after the convention, trump said that he would not accept cruz's endorsement if he offered it. "i don't want his endorsement. if he gives it, i will not accept it, just so you understand. if he gives it i will -- i will not accept. it won't matter. honestly he should've done it because nobody cares and he would've been in better shape for four years from now," trump said. facing senate primary in 2018? cruz's move may also be politically expedient. he faces a possible 2018 senate primary challenge from texas rep. michael mccaul, the chairman of the house homeland security committee, who has increasingly made an issue of cruz's failure to endorse trump. republican national committee chairman reince priebus has said republicans who don't back trump could pay a price down the road. and trump also floated the idea of setting up a super pac to oppose cruz if he decided to run for office again. clinton's campaign, after cruz's message posted on facebook, was happy to note a number of shots cruz took at trump during the primary, including when he called on the businessman to release his tax returns. clinton's official twitter account retweeted a tweet cruz sent during the primary that said, "i've released 9 years of tax returns. rt if you agree it's time for donald trump to release his!" clinton's campaign has been hounding trump to release his taxes, arguing that he isn't doing so because they show shady business deals and ties to russia. trump has said he would release his taxes after an irs audit. clinton's vice presidential nominee tim kaine, campaigning in austin, texas, friday, said he couldn't support someone who used the same language trump did about cruz's father. "i just can't help but say this," kaine said. "donald trump suggested that ted cruz's dad was involved in the jfk assassination. now we know that that is false, but false isn't, there's not the right word to describe what that is. it is so outrageously false. and as far as i know donald trump has not retracted it. as far as i know he has not apologized for it. and so if somebody said that about my dad they would never have me as a supporter for anything." radio host steve deace tweeted his disappointment, calling the move a mistake and speculating that cruz backers may not all follow the senator. "i think it's the worst political miscalculation of my lifetime. i hope i am wrong. the people will decide that," deace tweeted. cnn's jeremy diamond, tom lobianco, dan merica, betsy klein, and dan berman contributed to this report.      ted cruz endorses donald trump      
__label__0 washington, d.c. (cnn)the pentagon is considering a proposal that could send an additional 500 troops to iraq to help iraqi and kurdish forces take mosul from isis in the coming weeks, a us defense official told cnn. the possibility of sending some number of additional forces has been reported for several weeks, including by cnn. the wall street journal was the first to report the proposal centered around the possibility of up to 500 additional forces. no final decision has been made, the official said. if the proposal is approved, it is anticipated that would be the final wave of additional us forces for fighting isis, since mosul remains the last major isis stronghold in iraq, the official added. if the proposal is okayed, it will raise the ceiling on the number of us troops in iraq from 4,647 to over 5,000. several hundred additional troops move in and out of iraq on temporary deployment orders. currently, there are 4,470 there under the approved ceiling. the pentagon is not precisely revealing what the troops might be called upon to do. some number are expected to be military advisors and trainers for iraqi and kurdish forces, whiles others could be involved in logistics such as moving supplies and troops around the battlefield, the official said. arizona republican john mccain, chairman of the armed services committee, criticized the move thursday. "indeed, we read this morning of plans for yet another incremental increase of 500 troops in iraq, one more step down the road of gradual escalation," he said.       source: us weighs 500 more troops for iraq      
__label__0 washington (cnn)hillary clinton called friday for officials in charlotte, north carolina, to make public a police video showing the fatal shooting of keith lamont scott. the shooting of scott, a black man, has sparked protests in the city this week and is the latest incident to fuel a national discussion about lethal police force, particularly against african-americans. "charlotte should release police video of the keith lamont scott shooting without delay. we must ensure justice & work to bridge divides. --h," clinton said in a tweet, the "h" indicating that she personally approved the message. clinton will travel charlotte on sunday, according to her campaign spokesman, nick merrill. details will be forthcoming, he said. two police videos -- from a dashboard camera and an officer's body camera -- show how scott died. police allowed scott's family to view the videos wednesday but have so far declined to release the footage to the public. clinton, trump navigate politics of police violence on friday, scott's family released what it says is a separate cell phone video, recorded by his wife, that shows the moments leading up to his fatal shooting. clinton calls shootings 'intolerable' clinton has commented throughout the week on the shootings of scott and and terence crutcher, an unarmed black man who was killed by police last week in tulsa, oklahoma. at a campaign event on wednesday, clinton said that the police killings of scott and crutcher are "unbearable" and "intolerable." "there is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. but we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of african-americans killed by police officers in these encounters," clinton said. "it's unbearable. and it needs to become intolerable." clinton's campaign manager, robby mook, told cnn's "new day" this week that as president, clinton would prevent such shootings by building "bonds between communities and law enforcement." clinton's republican rival, donald trump, has not yet publicly commented on scott's death. speaking about the tulsa shooting, however, he said he was "very troubled" by the incident and suggested the officer -- who has since been charged with manslaughter -- "got scared" or was "choking," slang for a person who fails under pressure. family releases cell phone video charlotte-mecklenberg police chief kerr putney said friday he expected police videos of the shooting to be released eventually, when investigators decide that it can be released as part of a package with other information, so that the videos aren't released without context. this differed from his message a day earlier, when he said the public shouldn't expect the videos' release. scott's family on friday released cell phone video, recorded by his wife, that shows the moments leading to his fatal shooting by police tuesday. "don't shoot him. he has no weapon," rakeyia scott can be heard saying. the first portions of the shaky video appear to show a number of police officers surround a vehicle in a parking lot. a man repeatedly yells for someone -- apparently keith scott -- to "drop the gun." "he doesn't have a gun. he has a tbi (traumatic brain injury)," rakeyia scott says. "he's not going to do anything to you guys. he just took his medicine." police said an officer shot scott after he failed to heed commands to drop a gun. his family has said he didn't have a gun. cnn's jeff zeleny and dan merica contributed to this report.      clinton calls for charlotte to release shooting video 'without delay'      
__label__0 washington (cnn)us and allied warplanes have sunk over 100 isis boats, destroying 65 of them in september alone, according to the international military coalition. while iraq is nearly entirely land-locked, the tigris and euphrates rivers that cross that country are navigable, and isis has been using watercraft for a variety of purposes, including transporting fighters and conducting improvised explosive attacks.\ the us-led anti-isis coalition provided cnn with video of a september 10 airstrike against an isis tactical unit aboard a boat near bayji, iraq. barges, skiffs and motorized watercraft have been observed operating along the tigris and euphrates rivers for the purpose of ferrying isis fighters and equipment across the rivers, operation inherent resolve spokesperson col. joseph scrocca told cnn, adding that it happens often when anti-isis iraqi troops control the area's bridges. coalition bombs have also targeted bridges used by isis, thereby further necessitating the terror group's reliance on boats. "they have also been used by daesh for waterborne improvised explosive device attacks," the spokesperson added, using another name for the terror group. a us apache attack helicopter in july destroyed one such waterborne ied, a boat full of explosives. the vessel was attempting to remove a newly built iraqi bridge spanning the tigris river, according to the us military. "it destroyed the boat so it didn't go attack the bridge," us army col. christopher garver, a spokesman for the military coalition against isis, told reporters in august. but while the us and its allies have been striking isis boats for months, the last few weeks have seen a major uptick in the number that have been sunk, with over 50 destroyed on september 16 and 14. those strikes occurred near the towns of qayyara and sultan abdallah, which lie along the tigris river south of the isis-held city of mosul. experts think that the increase in the rate of strikes is tied to the upcoming effort by the us and iraq to retake mosul, which military officials have said could start as early as october. as part of its defensive efforts, "isis is going to try and move fighters up and down the river," retired us navy cdr. chris harmer told cnn. harmer thinks the us is attempting to scuttle the isis vessels in particular so that the group can't position its forces via the water. the tigris river runs directly through the heart of mosul, dividing iraq's second-largest city in two. he also called the boats an "easy target in terms of avoiding civilian casualties" for the us. isis, he said, might try to destroy bridges to slow the iraqi military's assault on mosul, noting that "a speedboat with 1,000 kilograms of explosives going into a bridge" is a lot harder to defend against than a conventional ied that would have to be set by isis operatives on foot. historically control of the two rivers has been critical to iraqi military campaigns. during world war i, the british used small armed river boats traveling up the tigris and euphrates in its campaign against the ottoman turks. harmer, now the senior naval analyst at the institute for the study of war in washington, said that the iraqi military had never really mastered riverine warfare -- fighting on the river -- making the coalition's support all the more essential. and despite the large number of boats sunk, harmer thinks isis may have no trouble seizing additional vessels from iraqi fishermen, farmers and others who have used the river for thousands of years. "there's always been a steady state of traffic flow on the river," harmer said.       isis has a navy? the us is sinking it

__label__0 washington (cnn)donald trump is watching videos of hillary clinton's past debate performances -- including both her highlights and lowlights -- ahead of their first debate monday. a source familiar with his preparations described trump's preparation, which has been described as far more minimal than clinton's, who is currently off the campaign trail to practice before the highly anticipated, nationally broadcast event. trump has huddled with his closest advisers in his prep session, including republican national committee chairman reince priebus, who sat in on last weekend's meeting, the source said. priebus will join trump again this weekend. clinton is similarly watching tape of trump's republican primary debates, according to several people familiar with her debate preparation. she took notes on what agitated him, particularly in his exchanges with rival ted cruz, and studied his style. to knock trump off his game, people advising clinton have been looking for a one-line retort that will be a memorable moment from the contest. but democrats worry the first debate will give trump a chance to show a more moderate, controlled side, while millions of people watch, possibly for the first time. this, according to people who have recently talked with the former secretary of state, is not lost on clinton. earlier this week, a top trump aide mocked clinton's extensive preparations for monday's debate in an internal campaign memo. "these are hallmarks of a career politician who has spent too much time seeking and clinging to power," trump spokesman jason miller said in the memo. "he's not rehearsing canned 30-second soundbites or spending hours in the film room like an nfl player. he will be prepared, but most importantly, he will be himself," miller added. in contrast to those lowered expectations set by trump's staff, the gop nominee may have raised the bar for himself by poking fun at clinton's debate preparations at a rally in pennsylvania thursday night, suggesting she is still recovering from her recent bout with pneumonia.

__label__0 washington (cnn)a federal judge on friday ordered the state department to release some, but not all, of the emails recovered from hillary clinton's private server by the fbi ahead of the presidential election in november. dc district court judge james boasberg said the department must process 1,050 pages of emails between now and november 4, releasing any non-exempt documents aside from those that are determined to be duplicates of those already released. it is unclear exactly how many pages the state department will have to release as part of that order, but it is expected to be significantly fewer than 1,000 pages. that's because a "substantial number" of the recovered documents are duplicates or near-duplicates, a justice department attorney representing the state department said in court. the state department has appraised approximately 15,000 documents recovered by the fbi, believed to have been sent by or to former secretary clinton while she was in office. of those, over 9,400 have been deemed personal and therefore not subject to release, the attorney said, while approximately 5,600 are believed to be work-related. production will begin october 7, with subsequent releases october 21 and november 4 -- four days before the election. the state department will then process 500 pages of the remaining documents per month until all have been released. the order by judge boasberg comes as part of a freedom of information act lawsuit brought by the conservative legal watchdog group judicial watch. an attorney for judicial watch pressed the judge to order the release of all the relevant records prior to the election. saying he was sympathetic to the efforts of the state department's heavily-taxed foia division, boasberg offered his 1,500-page order. "i think it's important the public have as much clarity as possible," boasberg said, but later quipped, "sometimes i wonder if there's anything other that foia processing going on at state." the judicial watch case is one over over two dozen foia lawsuits related to clinton's emails. in a statement to cnn, state department spokesman john kirby reiterated the state department's commitment to release the official emails, and said, "all releasable records and portions of these records will be posted on state's foia website."       judge orders state to release some, but not all, clinton emails by election day      
__label__0 (cnn)the mayor of charlotte, north carolina, publicly asked friday that the two leading presidential candidates delay plans to visit her city, which has been rocked this week by unrest following a police shooting of a black man. hours later, hillary clinton and donald trump's campaigns said they were dropping plans to visit the city in the upcoming days. "we appreciate the support of the candidates. we appreciate that they are concerned about charlotte," jennifer roberts told cnn's erin burnett on "outfront." "at this point, we do have very stretched resources for security and they are working around the clock. if there would be a way to delay those visits in terms of giving us a chance to get our city back to order and back to more of a state of normalcy, that would probably be ideal." clinton's campaign announced late friday that she would postpone a visit to the city after having announced that she would go to charlotte on sunday. an aide said the campaign had consulted with roberts' office about the visit, and were told about concerns that a trip would drain vital city resources. a campaign spokeswoman, jennifer palmieri, said clinton will instead visit on october 2. also late friday, two trump campaign officials said they were no longer considering a post-debate trip next week to the city, though they didn't mention roberts' plea. trump took to twitter friday night to criticize clinton over her decision to announce, and then reverse, her plans to visit the city. "crooked hillary's bad judgement forced her to announce that she would go to charlotte on saturday to grandstand. dem pols said no way, dumb!" he tweeted. trump, however, visited baton rouge, louisiana, last month, days after flooding devastated the area, opening him to criticism from clinton that he disrupted the response. the shooting of keith lamont scott has sparked protests in charlotte and is the latest incident to fuel a national discussion about lethal police force, particularly against african-americans. clinton, trump navigate politics of police violence clinton called friday for officials in charlotte to make public a police video showing the fatal shooting of scott. "charlotte should release police video of the keith lamont scott shooting without delay. we must ensure justice & work to bridge divides. --h," clinton said in a tweet, the "h" indicating that she personally approved the message. two police videos from a dashboard camera and an officer's body camera show how scott died, but have not been released to the public. police allowed scott's family to view the videos wednesday. cnn's jeff zeleny, dan merica, jim acosta and ashley killough contributed to this report.      clinton, trump scrap plans to visit charlotte after mayor's plea      
__label__0 a federal judge lashed out at the state department on monday over what he charged was foot-dragging over freedom of information act requests relating to hillary clinton's service as secretary of state. “you have a client that, to say the least, is not impressing the judges on this court, myself included. … it is in your client’s interest to start being more obviously cooperative,” u.s. district court judge richard leon warned justice department lawyers representing state during a hearing monday. “the state department is at risk of being perceived as obstreperous. [they] need to get with the program.” the 10-minute hearing took place on a suit for records on how — and whether — clinton and her aides were trained to handle classified information. state had proposed a deadline of oct. 17 to produce about 450 unclassified documents relating to the training issue sought by the daily caller news foundation. however, leon ordered the diplomatic agency to complete processing and disclosure of those records by oct. 10. he also said state must produce the records in three installments “of comparable size” and can’t leave the bulk of the records to the last batch. “we will do our best,” justice department attorney jason lee told leon. “do better than your best. … you do it,” leon shot back. the issue of classified-information training for clinton and her aides has drawn attention in recent weeks, after fbi director james comey observed that three emails received by clinton had paragraphs marked with a (c) for information classified as “confidential,” although the entire messages were not properly marked as classified and appeared to have involved a cut-and-paste job. comey also said that any senior official should have realized the topics being discussed in other emails were not suitable for an unclassified system. according to an fbi report, clinton said she could not recall receiving any training or briefing on how to handle classified information. however, when the extent of her use of a private email account as secretary was revealed last year, clinton said: “i’m certainly well-aware of the classification requirements.” an initial search for records responsive to the daily caller request turned up no records at all about training for clinton or deputy chief of staff huma abedin, while some were located for chief of staff cheryl mills and director of policy planning jake sullivan. however, a lawyer representing the daily caller, brad moss, asked state to do a more thorough search. that turned up over 1,000 records last week, the bulk of them classified files about the process state uses to approve access to a highly classified program and to withdraw it when it is no longer necessary or a person leaves government. in an interview broadcast monday on npr, former president bill clinton said he trusted the state department to make sure there was no conflict of interest with the clinton foundation while hillary clinton was secretary of state. lee said many of those records are classified “top secret or higher than top secret.” that complicates the processing because people have to be granted the proper clearances, he said. he offered no estimate when those records will be processed, although most of them are expected to be withheld as classified. leon also made clear that he believes the case should be prioritized because of the looming presidential election. “it’s time sensitive because it involves a national election for president,” the judge said. moss had objected to state’s plan to finish production of the roughly 450 documents by oct. 17, because that is only two days before the final presidential debate. the judge appeared to agree, saying the daily caller should have “time to go through them … for whatever newsworthy value they believe they have.” state has been swamped with dozens of lawsuits seeking emails sent or received by clinton during her four years as secretary, as well as emails of her top aides and records on various other topics related to clinton’s tenure. as the election draws nigh, state has faced demands from many quarters to get particular records out prior to the election. however, leon, a george w. bush appointee, didn’t seem interested in hearing much about that monday. instead, he noted that no lawyer from state was present at monday’s hearing. “impress upon them this way of doing business needs to stop,” the judge told lee. “they’re not feeling the heat.” the verbal fusillade prompted lee to step forward with further explanation, but he only managed to utter the words, “your honor …” before the judge stood and walked off the bench. “we’ll issue an order,” leon declared, passing up whatever lee had planned to say and brusquely leaving the courtroom. state department spokeswoman elizabeth trudeau declined to comment on the case that was in court monday but sent politico a statement defending her agency's broader transparency efforts. "the department strongly believes the freedom of information act is a critical part of maintaining transparency to the public. generally speaking, there has been a significant surge in foia requests to the state department in recent years and we are working diligently to respond," trudeau wrote. "the volume of foia requests received by the department has increased 300% since 2008 (6,000 requests per year to over 20,000 per year). in fiscal year 2015 alone we received approximately 22,000 foia requests." trudeau also said efforts are underway to improve state's responsiveness to public records requests. "we are taking steps to improve our foia process — including conducting foia training sessions for staff and working to implement new technologies and best practices. last year, secretary kerry appointed ambassador janice jacobs as transparency coordinator to help address records management challenges across the department," the spokeswoman said. update (monday, 4:13 p.m.): this post has been updated with state department comment.      judge gives state department tongue-lashing over clinton classification training records      
__label__0 donald trump’s threat to raise tariffs on china, mexico and other countries to force them to negotiate better deals with the united states “could unleash a trade war that would plunge the u.s. economy into recession and cost more than 4 million private sector jobs,” says a new study by the peterson institute for international economics. the nonpartisan think tank, which leans pro-free trade, outlines several scenarios that could result from the republican nominee's plans to raise tariffs and withdraw from trade deals, including the sweeping asia-pacific pact that the obama administration wrapped up last year. its conclusion: trump’s assault on nafta, china, the trans-pacific partnership and other trade deals would harm average american households, worsen income stagnation, devastate businesses and erode national security — and he would have the statutory authority to do it. story continued below "if implemented, these proposals would provoke retaliation by u.s. trading partners, unleashing a trade war that would send the u.s. economy into recession and cost millions of americans their jobs," the study says. trump’s top trade advisers dismissed the study as biased monday, saying it comes from a corporate-funded think tank and “signifies nothing.” “they are the pimps of globalization for the corporate interests who have sent american jobs overseas and basically turned america into a stagnant economy,” said peter navarro, an economics professor at the university of california, irvine who has helped trump develop his trade policies. nearly half of the institute’s revenue comes from major export-oriented corporations like caterpillar, pepsi and united technologies, according to its website. the study comes as trump and democratic nominee hillary clinton rail against past trade policies for inflicting job losses and economic pain among working-class voters. president barack obama, who is pressing congress to ratify the massive trans-pacific partnership before he leaves office, has pushed back against both candidates’ trade stances. while the peterson institute also faults clinton’s proposals, which call mainly for tougher enforcement, as leading to “stasis” in the expansion of trade, it reserves the bulk of its criticism for trump. his policies “are another matter altogether” and could have disastrous consequences for the economy and for national security, the study says. its projections are built on an earlier moody’s analytics study that estimated the economic effects of trump’s call for steep tariffs on mexican and chinese imports and the renegotiation of trade deals like nafta. under the worst-case scenario, u.s. employment could drop by nearly 5 million jobs in 2019, with states like washington, california, massachusetts and michigan suffering losses of nearly 5 percent of private-sector jobs, the think tank says. “even if the statements are strategic, acting on them can, intentionally or not, produce escalating cycles of retaliation by trading partners,” the peterson institute says. “when planning a war, it is not advisable to assume that one’s adversary will surrender when the first shot is fired. for these reasons, trump must be taken at his word.” but navarro, trump’s trade adviser, says his trump’s threat of tariffs is not an endgame but “simply part of an overall negotiating tool which is designed to get better and fairer deals.” another trump adviser, nucor steel company ceo dan dimicco, quipped that the study is designed to scare voters and “should have come out on halloween.” but dimicco said trump’s threats are "very real, and our trading partners who are cheating should take it very seriously." unchecked government subsidies and currency manipulation are just some of the ways other countries are gaining an unfair trade advantage, he said. trump could execute his stated plans to stop countries like china from “cheating” through executive powers that allow the president to raise tariffs unilaterally, the study finds. the nominee even went so far as to lay out the statutes he would invoke to retaliate against china’s “illegal activities” in a june 28 speech. many of the authorities allow the president to hike tariffs or restrict imports in other ways based on broad interpretations of national security. u.s. companies couldn’t count on lawmakers or the courts to act fast enough to head off any initial economic shocks caused by trump’s policies, the peterson study says. “at least for a few years, a president trump would have the stronger legal hand and his actions would very likely survive challenges in the u.s. courts and congress,” it says. legal action challenging the statutory authority could take months or even years, and any efforts by major u.s. importers like apple to seek rapid relief through preliminary injunctions to stop customs and border protection from collecting those duties would face legal uncertainty, the authors write. even if trump threatened high tariffs only as a tactical maneuver, “foreign countries will soon retaliate,” they say. countries "will not patiently wait for u.s court proceedings or litigation in the wto to vindicate their claimed rights under international law — specifically the right to export to the u.s. market at low [bound] tariffs, or duty free,” the authors say. “enormous economic damage to u.s. firms, workers and communities could ensue from a trade war long before the legal battlefield is cleared."      study: trump’s trade proposals ‘horribly destructive’

__label__0 mason city, iowa — hillary clinton’s statement that donald trump’s incendiary rhetoric aids isil’s cause is a “new low” for the clinton campaign, mike pence said on monday. “the campaign of insults went to a new low this morning,” pence said of clinton’s campaign. “hillary clinton actually said my running mate’s rhetoric had been ‘seized on by terrorists.’ … and she said donald trump’s rhetoric was ‘giving comfort to our adversaries.’” story continued below “well, hillary, strength does not give comfort to our adversaries, weakness does,” pence said. pence was referring to comments clinton made monday in response to attacks in minnesota, new york and new jersey. "we know that a lot of the rhetoric we've heard from donald trump has been seized on by terrorists, in particular isis, because they are looking to make this into a war against islam rather than a war against jihadists," she told reporters during a statement clinton has made this claim multiple times during the campaign. when she first leveled the charge in december, politifact said there was no evidence for it. but after isil used a clip of trump in a video after the group's attack on brussels, politifact updated its assessment, calling the claim true. pence's comments came on the heels of a radio interview with rush limbaugh in which pence said clinton is oblivious to the threats posed by terrorism and complicit in weakening u.s. law enforcement. “i’m not sure that hillary clinton and barack obama know that we’re at war,” pence said. he went on to blame democrats for a “culture of political correctness that is tying the hands of law enforcement here at home.” pence spoke to limbaugh on the phone from his plane on the tarmac in mason city, iowa, where he's appearing at a town hall event ahead of a rally in dubuque. he also slammed white house press secretary josh earnest for suggesting that the us and isil are engaged in a “narrative fight” and took issue with clinton’s statement earlier monday that donald trump’s fiery rhetoric aids isil. “the only thing that gives comfort to our adversaries is weakness,” pence said. the saturday explosions in new jersey and new york appear to be unrelated to the minnesota attack, officials say. the minnesota assailant stabbed nine people before being killed by police. isil has taken responsibility for the attack. the saturday night bombing in new york wounded 29 people, while the earlier explosion in new jersey before a charity race caused no injuries. an afghan immigrant believed to be tied to the bombings was arrested in new jersey on monday after a gunfight with police. “we are at war with radical islamic terrorism,” pence told limbaugh. “we are at war with the isis caliphate.”      pence: clinton doesn't 'know we’re at war'      
__label__0 new york — donald trump and hillary clinton's decisions to meet separately with egypt's authoritarian president on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly have prompted a growing outcry on both the left and the right. on monday, a small group of scholars and activists with a focus on egypt, including some who identify as conservatives, released a letter they had written to both presidential candidates urging them not to meet with abdel fattah al-sisi. the authors pointed to the thousands of people killed and imprisoned under sisi's harsh rule. story continued below "since taking power via a military coup three years ago, president sisi has overseen not only the complete reversal of egypt’s nascent democratic transition but also unprecedented human rights abuses," states the letter. "it is not in our interest to embrace him but to use our influence to press for beneficial change in egypt." the letter, dated friday, further states: "your meeting with sisi at the unga will be taken in egypt, and around the world, as an endorsement. to meet with him is a policy decision, which should await a later date after much study and assessment of u.s. policy toward egypt. therefore, we strongly urge you to readjust your schedule." the signatories were: michele dunne of the carnegie endowment for international peace; robert kagan of the brookings institution; elliott abrams of the council on foreign relations; reuel gerecht of the foundation for defense of democracies; neil hicks of human rights first; and stephen mcinerny of project on middle east democracy. the letter writers are part of a non-partisan working group on egypt that has been meeting since 2010, according to kagan. their criticism follows that of others including human right watch's executive director ken roth, who wrote on twitter: "why does hillary again want to meet sisi? he directed 817+ killed in 12 hours in rabaa sq" — a reference to a massacre in a cairo square under sisi's watch in 2013. clinton met with sisi on monday evening; the egyptian leader told her at the start of the meeting that he wished to talk to her “about the path that we are taking in order to build up a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law, that respects human rights and liberties. and as a matter of fact we are taking this path that is eventually leading up to this target,” according to a pool report of the event. trump's team released an account of his meeting with sisi that was striking in how much praise the republican heaped on egypt. trump expressed to sisi "his strong support for egypt’s war on terrorism, and how under a trump administration, the united states of america will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that egypt can count on in the days and years ahead." sisi, a retired general, came to prominence during the chaos of egypt's 2011 arab spring revolution. he took power in 2013 after mass protests prompted the military to oust the elected government of muslim brotherhood leader mohamed morsi. trump has said that if elected president, he will work with sisi to fight terrorism, describing him in a speech as someone who recognizes that "this ideology of death that must be extinguished." clinton is critical of sisi's predecessor, morsi, who was arrested after his ouster and now faces a death sentence, in "hard choices," her memoir about her years as secretary of state. but clinton also has criticized sisi, who she wrote "appears to be following the classic mold of middle eastern strongmen." clinton's decision to meet with sisi could stem from a desire to signal to arab allies in the region that she will partner with rulers who impose stability, even if those rulers are autocrats.      trump, clinton blasted for meeting egypt's strongman leader      
__label__0 kent, ohio—a lonely hillary supporter stood with a sign outside the rec center at kent state university on saturday, a gray and muggy afternoon for a rally. “insecure, small penised white guys for trump!!!” his sign read. near him, grizzled men in fatigues and sunglasses and a fraternity brother held pro-trump signs. but the main swirl of activity ahead of bernie sanders’ speech in this ohio college town was the dozen fervent jill stein supporters, formerly fervent bernie supporters, holding signs and signing up volunteers. “we have a better choice,” one sign—puffy paint on rumpled printer paper—said. “the two-party system is messed uuuup!” sang patty friedrich, a local green party organizer, as she pranced around, handing out fliers to people going to the rally. “embrace the suuuuuck!” story continued below “i think our democracy is over after this election,” said kristyn nye, who works in marketing. “it doesn’t matter who wins.” bernie had opened her eyes, she said, and when he left the race, she was bereft of choice and angered by his speech at the democratic national convention in july. “he should’ve just dropped the mic,” nye said. “i wish he would’ve just stuck it to them. what does he have to lose? people in vermont love him!” after a rally in akron, bernie sanders had arrived in kent on a mission that might be critical to the election: coaxing disaffected ohioans not just to vote, but to vote for the woman whom he’d been calling corrupt just a few months ago. with donald trump moving up in the polls—and even, according to some polls, leading in this crucial swing state—the clinton campaign sent in the reinforcements: bernie sanders. hillary for america, which organized the event, was evidently hoping that sanders, with his anti-establishment appeal and image of fiery authenticity, could bring his herd—and maybe a few stragglers—more securely into the fold. but it was not clear how well it was working: nye had internalized bernie’s message so fully that she had decided to vote for jill stein, the green party candidate. she was for jill mostly because she disliked hillary, who voted for the war in iraq, is constantly surrounded by scandal and, in nye’s view, “doesn’t stand for anything.” she also may or may not have parkinson’s. “but i know a person with parkinson’s, and i don’t know how she would be able to control the shakes,” nye muses out loud. “she would have to be on so many drugs that she’d be so out of it, but she seems sharp. how does she do it?” maybe she just doesn’t have parkinson’s? i offered. nye blinked at me, not understanding. “she’s just so untrustworthy, that i just don’t know,” she finally responded. “is it pneumonia?” and another thing, nye said. clinton wants to start a war with russia, which she heard on russia today. when i pointed out that this was a channel paid for exclusively by the kremlin, she wondered how that was any different from, say, npr. she wasn’t going to the rally inside the rec center to hear bernie speak, and neither were the other bernie diehards there that day. “why? to hear a man who sold his soul?” said michele bline, 54, a disabled veteran of desert storm. “bernie sold ooouuuut!” sang friedrich nearby. “they threatened his familyyy!” “we’ve heard it all before,” bline went on. “we know where he stands,” “he’s not going to sway me,” a grad student named gwen west chimed in. inside, past the humming treadmills and clanging weights, on the far edge of the basketball courts, walled off from the dribblers and dunkers by a wall of semi-transparent white netting, sanders stood slouching over the lectern, his rumpled pants falling on clunky black shoes, holding forth to a crowd of about 300. a sanders rally of yore this was not. earlier that day in akron, only about 150 came out to hear the old prophet of political revolution. here, he tried to fulfill his promise to do whatever he could to prevent trump from being president. to cheers and finger snaps, he talked about the man’s bigotry and “the so-called bertha movement.” “now let me be very clear about what the bertha movement really is,” he went on in his brooklyn accent about the faux controversy trump spawned about obama’s provenance. “it’s not about disagreeing with obama—you can disagree any time you want. what they were trying to do, led by donald trump, is to delegitimize the presidency of the first black president we have ever had. ... what an outrage! what a racist attack!” “this is an enormously, enormously, enormously important election,” he pressed on, the crowd beaming up at him. “and for those of your friends who say, ‘well, i don’t like anybody, i’m not going to vote’ ... ask your friends why the koch brothers are spending hundreds of millions of dollars if this election is not important.” it took him a while to get around to saying it, but he did: “hillary clinton believes as i believe” that the minimum wage must be raised, that women should control their own bodies, that “our gay brothers and sisters have the right to get married.” “you have to do everything you can to make sure that secretary clinton and [democratic senate candidate] ted strickland win in this state!” afterward, he was mobbed for handshakes and selfies. “did you get to shake his hand?” lorie sewell, a local teacher, asked her husband jim. “twice!” jim grinned. they had voted for bernie in the primaries and were still fans, but, said jim, who teaches at kent state, “there was no convincing necessary” to get them to support clinton. he went on, “we would’ve rather voted for bernie, but the choice is pretty darn clear.” three freshmen, samantha, quincy and molly, were exhilarated by the various media interviews they had given after the rally, and their parents—it was parents’ weekend—waited patiently until they could get a bite to eat. the girls were all ardent bernie supporters—and one of their dads was, too—but they liked clinton fine, too. their parents had supported her, and it was a natural switch for them. “i was always going to vote for hillary if bernie didn’t win,” samantha said. nearby, three young female students, two of them black, told me they had voted for bernie but were willing to support hillary in order to keep trump from being elected—which, one of them laughed, would usher in “world war 17.” they weren’t huge fans of hillary and her “sketchy” history, but they understood the stakes and sanders’s lobbying for her was compelling. “bernie’s supporting her,” kelyanne, a junior, said, “so there must be a side of her that’s good that we just don’t see.” there was a small commotion in the wings—the student volunteers were meeting privately with bernie, who thanked them for their support and took a group photo with them. afterward, two of them, both college democrats who had voted for bernie in the primaries, gushed about that moment. “he had his hand on his shoulder!” brian dipaolo said, pointing to his comrade anthony erhardt. they still loved bernie, but the switch hadn’t been wrenching for them either. “i was never a bernie-or-buster,” said erhardt. “it was not hard” to watch bernie concede in philadelphia and pass the baton to clinton. “it was a celebratory moment,” he said. there are still some things on which erhardt disagreed with clinton, but ultimately, he said, “the pros outweigh the cons.” “i’m voting for her because she’s more qualified,” dipaolo said matter-of-factly, clearly proud of the maturity of his reasoning. “i like to say that we’re not selling out, we’re buying in.” sure, they had some friends who were holding out and planning on sitting out the election—all the students i talked to did—and they just hadn’t bothered to even come see bernie that afternoon. this struck them all as “selfish” and “self-centered” and the people outside, the jill stein supporters, are “just doing harm to bernie’s image.” or, as erhardt put it, “i love bernie, i still do. i just hate his supporters.”      bernie’s gambit in ohio      
__label__0 north carolina gov. pat mccrory has withdrawn his lawsuit against the obama administration over the state’s law that curbs legal protections for transgender people. lawyers for mccrory said in a court filing on friday that north carolina was dropping the lawsuit, citing “substantial costs” to the state. they wrote that continuing the litigation is unnecessary since north carolina will have the chance to defend its transgender law, known as hb2, as part of a separate lawsuit that the justice department has brought against the state. story continued below mccrory initially filed the lawsuit in may after the obama administration threatened to withhold federal funding to the state because of the law, which requires transgender people to use public restrooms that match the sex listed on their birth certificate, rather than their gender identity. the justice department countered with its own lawsuit against north carolina, filed hours later. that case remains ongoing. the voluntary dismissal of the lawsuit on friday won’t bring the debate over the legality of north carolina’s law to an end anytime soon. and the question of transgender bathroom access continues to spark lawsuits around the country. federal judges have ruled in different directions on the issue, which may ultimately end up before the u.s. supreme court. a federal judge last month ordered the university of north carolina to let two transgender students and one employee use bathrooms that align with their gender identities. but a federal judge in texas has temporarily blocked the obama administration from enforcing its directive that schools allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match with their gender identity.      north carolina drops suit against obama administration over ‘bathroom bill’

__label__0 donald trump took full advantage of the opportunity monday to return to blasting barack obama and hillary clinton for failing to keep the country safe in the wake of this weekend's bomb attacks in new york city. and clinton jumped on the news to prosecute her own case against trump: that he is a dangerous demagogue whose inflammatory rhetoric puts the nation at further risk. the polls offer a more nuanced picture. voters trust clinton over trump by a narrow margin when it comes to terrorism and national security — a reversal from past elections when republicans were seen as the party stronger on national defense. but that’s not the end of the story: trump’s supporters are far more concerned about terrorism than clinton’s, suggesting the gop nominee could appeal to voters who are increasingly anxious about safety at home. story continued below the attacks this weekend present a new backdrop to the one-week run-up to the first general-election debate — a one-on-one showdown on national television between clinton and trump, held fewer than 30 miles from the scene of an explosion on the west side of manhattan that wounded more than two dozen people on saturday evening. both candidates on monday sought to reinforce their credentials on terrorism and spin it into an advantage. clinton held a press conference at a suburban new york airport before traveling to philadelphia, calling herself “the only candidate in this race who has been part of the hard decisions to take terrorists off the battlefield.” trump, meanwhile, responded with a statement on facebook, saying clinton “has emboldened terrorists all over the world to attack the u.s., even on our own soil,” adding that terrorists “are hoping and praying that hillary clinton becomes [p]resident — so that they can continue their savagery and murder.” overall, polls conducted prior to this weekend give the democratic nominee a slim advantage on the issue. in last week’s fox news poll, clinton edged trump among likely voters asked who would do a better job handling terrorism and national security, 47 percent to 46 percent. among registered voters surveyed by cbs news/new york times over a similar time period, 49 percent trusted clinton more on national security and terrorism — which rated a close second to the economy and jobs on a list of most-important issues — compared to 45 percent for trump. in a quinnipiac university poll last week, 49 percent of likely voters said clinton would do a better job “keeping the country safe from terrorism,” while 47 percent said trump would do a better job. and in an abc news/washington post poll this month, half of registered voters said they trust clinton more to handle terrorism, more than the 41 percent who trust trump — though that margin narrows to 48 percent for clinton to 45 percent for trump among likely voters. clinton, multiple polls show, is viewed as having experience and as the better informed, more stable leader. in the fox news poll, 61 percent of likely voters say the former secretary of state is “qualified to be president,” far more than the 45 percent who say trump is qualified. fifty-nine percent think clinton “has the temperament to serve effectively as president,” compared to only 38 percent who say trump is temperamentally fit. but voters also see trump as a decisive candidate who will tell it like it is and is more committed to attacking the islamic state in the middle east. in a slightly older cnn/orc international poll, conducted over the first four days of this month, half of voters said the phrase “a strong and decisive leader” applied more to trump than the 42 percent who said it applied to clinton. (that poll, the only live-caller national poll trump has led since the conventions, also found trump ahead on the issue of terrorism, 51 percent to 45 percent. clinton’s slight edge on terrorism and national security in most polls reverses what was a traditional republican advantage. for decades, voters have seen the gop and its presidential nominees as stronger on defense. as an incumbent in 2004, then-president george w. bush enjoyed a sizable advantage on terrorism over then-sen. john kerry (d-mass.). a cbs news/new york times poll in early october of that year found more voters had confidence that bush (52 percent) would make the right decisions when it came to protecting against a terrorist attack than had confidence in kerry (39 percent). barack obama faced a similar gap in the 2008 campaign against sen. john mccain (r-ariz.), who was lauded as a vietnam war hero and has focused on defense issues during his time in the senate. voters throughout the campaign trusted mccain over obama on terrorism, according to abc news/washington post polls, though the gap between the two candidates narrowed toward election day. in 2012, obama, with the benefit of incumbency and the killing of osama bin laden the year before, grabbed the advantage that year over former massachusetts gov. mitt romney. obama was generally more trusted on foreign policy, according to data from the pew research center, and exit polls showed more voters trusted obama to handle an international crisis than romney. but even though more voters, on average, trust clinton over trump on terrorism, rising unease about more attacks could benefit the republican. prior to this weekend, trump voters were far more concerned about terrorism: in last week’s quinnipiac university poll, a combined 79 percent of likely voters said it was “very” or “somewhat” likely that there would be a terrorist attack in the u.s. “in the near future … causing large numbers of lives to be lost.” (no one was killed in this weekend’s incidents.) virtually all of trump’s supporters, 96 percent, said it was at least “somewhat likely” there would be an attack in the near future, including a 57-percent majority who said it’s “very likely.” but just 64 percent of clinton backers said it was likely, and only 19 percent said it was “very likely.” that anxiety extends to voters’ own lives. a combined 47 percent of likely voters said they are at least “somewhat concerned” that they or someone in their family “will be the victim of a terrorist attack” — with, again, a sharp break by the presidential candidate they support. more than two-thirds of trump’s voters, 68 percent, said they were at least “somewhat concerned” about being the victim or someone in their family being the victim of a terrorist attack — while only 29 percent of clinton supporters were concerned about it. this has also been a traditional republican advantage: voters most concerned about terrorism have tended to support the gop ticket in large numbers. in 2008, mccain defeated obama among the quarter of americans who were “very worried” about a terrorist attack in the united states, 54 percent to 43 percent, according to the exit poll. but in the past two elections, terrorism hasn’t been a major issue for voters. in that 2008 exit poll, only 9 percent of voters said terrorism was the most important issue, and mccain won them overwhelmingly, 86 percent to 13 percent. the 2012 exit poll didn’t even ask voters about terrorism, though a september 2012 pew survey found romney voters (68 percent) were significantly more likely than obama voters (55 percent) to say terrorism was “very important” to their vote. the last time terrorism was a significant factor in a presidential campaign, the bush-kerry race in 2004, 19 percent of voters in the exit poll rated it as their most important issue. bush carried them by 72 points, 86 percent to 14 percent.      who has the upper hand on terrorism, clinton or trump?      
__label__0 as a fifth-generation rockefeller, i was raised on the practical standards of what used to be known as rockefeller republicanism and later, reagan republicanism. one of the guiding principles of this political philosophy was to reach across the aisle to make progress on issues that would best serve the american people. we were above all a problem-solving party that was fiscally disciplined, fully accountable, less inflexible on social issues, and willing to compromise in order to get things done. i’m sad to say that the commonsensical “party of the people,” of which i was once proud to be a member, no longer exists. but that doesn’t mean it can’t exist again. indeed, ironically enough, donald trump’s rapacious presidential campaign has done so much to destroy the soul of the republican party that he might be just the thing that allows us to reinvent it altogether, and along lines that will appeal to millennials and beyond. story continued below true, for now, the rise of this very un-republican, doomsday-is-here candidate has driven many of us who remained in the party—what i like to think of as the reasonable, forward-thinking republicans—away. some used to call us moderates; i prefer the term pragmatists. now, we’ve either drank the trump kool-aid, are hiding in embarrassment, are just sitting this one out or have reluctantly joined the other side. our best hope of avoiding extinction is trump’s resounding defeat, a definitive sign that the republican party must evolve and change. but we should look on the positive side of this disaster. trump is like an amateurish hacker who’s implanted a virus that has exposed the party’s outdated operating system—its too-narrow ideology. now we can start from the ground up again, and to install this critical update, we need the startup attitude and energy of our digital generation. my hope is that some rockefeller republican code will be a part of this transformation, rebooting a legacy of pragmatism and public service. at least that is what i’m working on now. millennials now number 83.1 million, the largest demographic in the united states and equal in voting power to baby boomers. so, instead of directing my own philanthropy into the wasteland of campaign finance, i’m seeking to get young americans working on solutions. that’s why i’ve supported a national college program that brings together diverse groups of socially minded republicans, democrats and independents, to converse, brainstorm and resolve problems based on issues, rather than affiliations. the raw material is plainly there, among the younger generation, to restore the republican party to its rightful place as the party of reason. millennials value integrity over intransigence, action over rhetoric and equality over elitism. a poll by the harvard institute of politics noted that among potential voters age 18 to 29 what is valued most in a candidate is integrity, level-headedness and authenticity. according to a pew report, a majority of young republicans say immigrants strengthen america, corporate profits are too high, and stricter environmental laws are worth the cost. and among the one-third of millennials who affiliate with or lean republican, just 31 percent have a mix of political values that are right-of-center, whereas 51 percent take a mix of liberal and conservative positions and 18 percent have consistently or mostly liberal views. trump is like an amateurish hacker who’s implanted a virus that has exposed the party’s outdated operating system.” to move toward a more purposeful party platform, here are a few proposals that place sound policy before partisanship. while increasing border security (without building a nonsensical wall), create a system where undocumented immigrants can work towards legal status, not citizenship. acknowledge the dangers of climate change and promote a 20-30 year transitional path from fossil fuels to alternative energy sources, which includes a revenue neutral carbon tax. close the gun-show loophole and expand the market for smart handguns that can only be used by their owners. form a bipartisan commission on tax reform that will require two ironclad criteria: revenue neutrality and the guarantee that recommendations would receive only an up-or-down vote preventing riders and amendments. in addition, to keep the swarms of lobbyists at bay, members of the house and senate would have to wait a minimum of three years before becoming a consultant or lobbyist. the idea isn’t to go back in time and turn republicanism into a kind of norman rockwell painting. we’re talking about the evolution of a new paradigm where some of the valued principles of the party are encoded with a state-of-the-art brand of logical thinking that addresses reality and gets government working again. *** i come to practical politics from a very personal perspective. at 19, i was in a horrific car crash and lost my right leg above the knee and the use of my right arm. this life crisis reframed everything, and i had to learn to look at challenges and obstacles through the simple prism of “either this is going to work or it isn’t.” over time, my politics shifted, as well. instead of caring about what was more conservative or more liberal, my focus turned to what’s doable and efficient. when he lost the republican presidential nomination to barry goldwater in 1964, my great-uncle, nelson rockefeller, became one of the first victims of the extremist element’s rise in the party. during the campaign, he accused goldwater of being out of touch with reality, which sounds disturbingly relevant today. my uncle, jay rockefeller, the only democrat in the family to serve in public office, retired last year after 30 years in the senate. while reliably liberal, he was always more concerned with policy than politics. he mourned the loss of a system where reasonable negotiation and collaborative deal making were mutually agreed upon standards. hence my hope for the future of the party rests largely on the next generation of reasonable republican leaders. like many of those who identify as republicans, i’m not a “rino” (republican in name only), but rather someone seeking to update essential but dying traditions from the inside of a party that is on the verge of falling apart. when i became eligible to vote in 1979, i was proud to be a reagan republican. now, younger gop supporters, who aren’t aligned with the party’s platform or want no part of a trump candidacy, have no place to turn. as part of our college project, i sent out a request for opinions and feedback on today’s party platform. one note that was particularly moving was from a 25-year-old gay man named john, who preferred to remain anonymous. “i have found it very difficult to support the republican party, with the attractive free-market ideals clouded in divisive rhetoric and obstructionist tactics,” he wrote. “as a gay person, i have also been repelled by the party's socially conservative agenda. if the republican party wants to survive and gain the support of my generation, it needs to become the party of reason. my generation is largely nonreligious, supportive of our diverse citizens (including race, sexual orientation, etc.) and solution focused. i hope republican leaders will consider this going forward. now is the perfect time to reinvent the party.” it is indeed time—or will be after november 8—from the rubble left behind by the trump candidacy. the way to do that will be to remind ourselves what the party once stood for and what it was built on. if ronald reagan were talking to disheartened millennials today, that’s exactly what he would say: we’re the party that freed the slaves, the party of inclusion, the party of immigration. the harsh truth is reagan wouldn’t even qualify as a republican today—and he would call out a demagogue like donald trump as a perilous threat to traditional conservative tenets. moreover, reagan brought a sense of optimism and hope to a nation that had been worn down and divided and made people proud to be americans again. trump’s apocalyptic prophecies are anathema to the confidence and positivity reagan inspired in us. there must be a sea change in the gop definition of visionary leadership. we need to encourage millennials who identify with the party of lincoln to start running for school boards, city councils and state legislatures, as well as develop online communities and databases. and to elect republican representatives, senators and governors who reflect their values and stands on issues. this is where the next great republican leaders and president will come from. i don’t approve of some of president barack obama’s policies, but i agree 100 percent when he says, “democracy isn’t a spectator sport.” for me, it’s time to be investing in gop 2.0.      take it from a rockefeller (republican), we can revive the gop      
__label__0 sen. ben sasse is seeking answers from president barack obama about a pair of wire transfer payments from the u.s. to iran that seemingly undercut the explanation he gave for a cash payment to the islamic republic last january. sasse’s letter comes on the heels of a politico report in which the treasury department confirmed that the u.s. made two separate wire transfer payments, one in july 2015 and another in april 2016, to iran. the 2015 wire transfer in particular contradicts the president’s explanation of a $400 million payment to iran last january, which obama said had to be delivered in cash “precisely because we are so strict in maintaining sanctions and we do not have a banking relationship with iran that we couldn't send them a check and we could not wire the money.” story continued below the treasury department spokesman declined to offer an explanation as to why the july 2015 wire transfer was possible under u.s. sanctions against iran while the january 2016 payment was impossible. “these wire transfers, mr. president, seemingly contradict what you have previously told the american people,” sasse (r-neb.) wrote in his letter to the president. in his letter to the president, sasse asks obama how many wire transfer payments to iran the u.s. government has made any how many payments it has made in cash. he also asks, among other questions, to which sanctions was obama referring when he said at his aug. 4 press conference that a wire transfer payment to iran would have been impossible.      sasse seeks answers from obama on iran      
__label__0 new york — regardless of who wins this november, the next u.s. president should stand united with europe against russian aggression, including moscow's interference in other countries' elections, latvia's foreign minister said monday. edgars rinkēvičs' comments to politico come as americans face two stark choices in the white house race: republican donald trump, who has spoken in friendly terms of russian president vladimir putin, and democrat hillary clinton, who has pledged to get tough on the kremlin. story continued below in an interview on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly in new york, rinkēvičs steadfastly declined to say who he'd prefer win the upcoming election — "the choice of the american people will be made this november," he said. "whatever that choice is it must be respected." but he emphasized that u.s. willingness to join europe in standing up to russia in recent years through sanctions and other means was a policy that should continue. "we should understand the kind of values we all share across both sides of the atlantic are under attack from many actors" including "countries that really want to challenge the current state of the world, the revisionist countries," rinkēvičs said. the latvian diplomat noted that several european countries, including france and germany, are holding important federal elections next year. russia is believed to be quietly supporting far-right parties in some european states, including through financial aid. kremlin-backed hackers also are suspected of staging digital attacks on the u.s. election infrastructure this year. and russia's state-supported media clearly favors trump. trump has said that, if he's elected, the u.s. may not come to the military aid of baltic states (estonia, lithuania and latvia) if they are attacked by russia if the three small countries have not paid their fair share to nato. the baltics have protested such comments, saying they are increasing their defense spending and pointing out that a common defense is at the heart of the nato alliance. the baltic states worry that russia, which invaded and annexed a piece of ukraine in 2014, is trying to re-establish the soviet sphere of influence, including through manipulation of elections. "we do see that money is often used in europe," rinkēvičs said of the russia methods. "the same sometimes happens with direct and indirect ways this country also tries to influence our internal political life."      latvian foreign minister says next u.s. president must combat russian aggression      
__label__0 hillary clinton’s recent reference to many of donald trump’s supporters as a “basket of deplorables” comprised of racists and homophobes only made explicit what her advertisements and other public statements have insinuated. three weeks ago, she released a video that confronts trump with the support he has received from white supremacists. in it, jared taylor, editor and founder of the white-supremacist magazine american renaissance, is quoted from an interview with cnn: “sending out all the illegals, building a wall, add a moratorium on islamic immigration—that’s very appealing to a lot of ordinary white people.” story continued below it’s pretty obvious what clinton hopes to get from this line of campaigning: underscoring trump’s endorsements from white supremacists might deter moderates, independents and mainstream republicans who are loath to be associated with the right-wing fringe. however, her mudslinging also condemns trump voters—half of them, at least—who may support trump’s social platform, but not in the interest of institutionalizing the supremacy of white people. these white working-class voters support trump because he articulates their complicated discomfort with immigration and demographic change. some observers are quick to call them racist—and certainly some are. but over the past six months, i’ve interviewed more than 100 white working-class people both here and in the united kingdom, where a similar nationalist surge has triggered accusations of racism. my interviews suggest that there is a complexity to trump’s supporters that is not as simplistic as a yes-no binary about whether they’re racist. millions of trump’s supporters exist in the vast space between wall street and breitbart. is it racist to associate immigration with the greater globalization of commerce that has altered the economic prospects of outmoded people? is it racist to be frustrated that members of ethnic minorities are rendered new advantages unavailable to white people, such as affirmative action policies and ethnicity-specific advocacy? is it racist to believe that white working-class people are underrepresented in political leadership or vilified in popular media? clinton’s decision to lump all voters with these concerns into the sweeping category of “racist” might motivate her base, and might even be correct as a short-term political calculation: she probably won’t win over these voters. but there’s a long-term societal risk here: shunning them as racists pushes them only deeper into pockets of private discomfort, where their perceptions go unexposed and unchallenged—entrenching their views and further polarizing the american public. ultimately, clinton’s statements will worsen a long-term social dilemma among the voters she broad-brushes—how americans understand racism itself. *** “racism” is a powerful word in american culture, and an important one to talk about. it’s the right way to describe the long history of prejudice and discrimination against people on the basis of their looks and ancestry. it’s also important to identify in modern society, linking contemporary expressions and ideas to earlier injustices, such as the enslavement of blacks or the genocide of native people. while they may not be equivalent, housing discrimination and police violence against african-americans—enduring forms of racism—are thus rightly seen as legacies of past oppression. this is valuable because it contextualizes the choices and policies of contemporary americans in our troubled history of race. however, allegations of racism are now viewed by many white people as a means of wielding their ancestors’ misdeeds to unfairly disqualify their dissenting viewpoints in the present. in the view of many of the voters trump is speaking to—not just the “alt-right,” but disaffected white voters across the board—it’s crucial to talk frankly, even critically, about the perils of islam, immigration and black lives matter, even if it means offending some listeners. and on the more politically activated end of that spectrum, such voters see suppression of their ideas is part of a broader conspiracy to impose a liberal worldview. it’s a perception that has been seized by trump—“we cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore,” he said in his july gop convention speech—but also by far-right leaders in europe, like britain’s nigel farage, the former head of the uk independence party and one of the leaders behind the uk's departure from the european union. both trump and farage have heralded the power of their countries’ “silent majority”—a hushed constituency of predominantly white voters whose views have long been ignored. many of these purportedly ignored views scapegoat minority groups for broader social problems—often based on stereotypes, myths and prejudice. but even well-meaning conservative critiques of social policies have been tarnished by far less valid accusations of racism. from the time i’ve spent interviewing white working-class people in the united states and the uk, i’ve seen how many people find trump’s and farage’s unfiltered statements refreshing. the two men elevate hearsay to podiums and shout the very ideas that supporters have been too intimidated to mutter under their breath. in britain, dozens of my respondents would often preface their most candid thoughts to me by stating “i’m not a racist, but … ” “i’m not racist, but this country’s covered by blacks and bosnians.” “i’m not racist at all. i’ve got black cousins and nieces. but the polish have been taking all of the work and running prostitution and drug rings.” “i’m not a racist. i fucking love goat curry, pardon my language. but the principle of english families not coming first is just not right.” these individuals had not endured hours of sensitivity training; they were concerned that their ideas would be disqualified, when they are, in fact, sincere expressions about how their societies are being transformed. racism is perceived to be a “mute button” pressed on someone while they are still crying out about a sense of lost status—from a position of historic advantage, frequently in terms they have difficulty articulating. therefore, the preface “i’m not racist” is not a disclaimer, but rather an exhortation to listen and not dismiss or invalidate the claims of a group that feels marginalized. interestingly, those respondents who were able to more specifically articulate their frustration framed it in the civil rights themes of equality and justice. an unemployed 18-year-old londoner said, “you go for an interview and most of the employers are asians. basically, they’re discriminating against us, and we were here first. i have some training as a retail sales assistant. but when i’ve submitted my cv, i’ve been told that i can’t apply because i’m not asian. … i feel like i’m beneath them.” back in the united states, an electrician from youngstown, ohio, told me that “white people have become the minority itself. … people have freaked out on me for things i’ve said because i can’t say anything [about black people] because of slavery and their historical oppression. people aren’t looking for equality; they’re looking for retaliation.” these two were not members of any white-supremacist group. many white working-class individuals simply view the broader struggle against racism as one that demotes white people, rather than promotes others to equal ground. they feel estranged from minority groups, who they believe have access to new privileges that compensate for historic advantages that today’s white working-class people do not recall exploiting. they feel alienated from an urban white bourgeoisie, which has divorced their less skilled or geographically isolated co-ethnics and look down upon them. and they feel blamed for neither empathizing with the plight of minorities, nor mobilizing to overcome structural poverty and embrace global cosmopolitanism. *** to govern effectively, hillary clinton needs white people to buy into the social change she heralds. so instead of casting them as outmoded bigots, she could point to how the very social forces that entrench white working-class people into poverty also entrench minority groups—that there are no white problems or minority problems; there are just problems. she can assert that the status quo for white (and nonwhite) working-class people is reinforced not by the pursuit of political correctness, but instead by the propagation of racial divisions between us. by dismissing trump’s supporters as racist—however rightfully in many cases—clinton further numbs many white people to the sensitivity with which racism was once regarded. it erects a barrier between clinton’s pursuit of equal justice and the defensive holdouts with whom she must ultimately cooperate to achieve her vision of social progress. silencing and demonizing trump’s supporters as racists simplistically shuns them into the ideological silos that segregate our society. we will never find common ground if we don’t share space.      ‘i’m not a racist, but…’      
__label__0 a house panel will vote wednesday on whether to begin contempt proceedings against stemexpress, a human tissue procurement company that used to work with planned parenthood. the house select investigative panel on infant lives will vote to hold the company and ceo cate dyer in contempt of congress for not complying with subpoenas to turn over documents on its fetal tissue processing, chairwoman marsha blackburn (r-tenn.) announced monday evening. the panel would have to vote to send the resolution to the full house — a matter that is unlikely to take place until after the november election. story continued below the panel, which was initiated in the wake of the sting videos by an anti-abortion group targeting planned parenthood, has sought information from stemexpress for months. blackburn has said that the company and its executives have not fully complied with congressional subpoenas to turn over accounting records and other documents. stemexpress executives and lawyers say the company has complied with the subpoenas and has offered to testify before the committee. democrats on the panel agree the company has complied and blasted the investigation as a "witch hunt." "the mccarthyesque threat that stemexpress ‘name names’ of all employees, or face congressional contempt is disgraceful," rep. jan schakowsky (d-ill.), the committee's top democrat said in a statement, noting that stemexpress turned over 1,700 pages of documents. "we will fight this continued abuse of congressional authority every step of the way.” the investigation into the fetal tissue business began in the wake of anti-abortion activist david daleiden’s sting videos last summer. the videos suggested that planned parenthood illegally sold fetal tissue and organs to companies like stemexpress. both planned parenthood and stemexpress denied doing anything improper and say the videos were selectively edited to create misleading impressions. in two of the videos, former stemexpress technician holly o’donnell claims that she once saw another technician appear to obtain fetal tissue without a patient’s consent. stemexpress “unequivocally” denied the claim. o’donnell worked for the company for only a short period. the committee issued dozens of subpoenas to researchers, abortion providers and fetal tissue companies like stemexpress. republicans have focused in particular on obtaining stemexpress's accounting records, such as tax records and invoices, to see the company's expenses and revenues over several years. republicans argue that if money was made procuring fetal tissue, it would be a violation of federal law. stemexpress, which used to collect fetal tissue from planned parenthood and send it to researchers throughout the country, ended its relationship with planned parenthood in august 2015. blackburn told politico last week that the panel was considering how to deal with the unanswered subpoenas.

__label__0 in a rational world, we would interpret the inept crimes of accused pipe bomber ahmad khan rahami as evidence that 15 years after the big one, the terrorist threat in america is akin to a brush fire—the kind of thing that inevitably flares up and causes some damage before the experts put it out. instead, thanks to the cable news channels and some in the web and print space, we’ve turned it into a mighty conflagration. donald trump, ever the opportunist, sounded this alarm saturday shortly after the bomb went off in manhattan’s chelsea district. “nobody knows exactly what’s going on. but boy, we are living in a time—we better get very tough, folks,” trump said, when the shrapnel was still sizzling. the cable news channels jumped on the story in a galvanic fashion for a number of reasons. first, the story happened in their new york backyard. it is an unwritten rule of assaults, murders, natural disasters and other injurious acts that their news potential is inversely proportional to the distance from the news organization’s headquarters. for example, if a pipe bomb went off in kansas city, the news response of the new york-based networks would be middling. but if a new york city cop broke his toe kicking a suspect in the butt, we’d be just a few chyrons away from a breaking news alert. story continued below second, the detonation of one bomb is an indicator that additional bombs might exist until proved otherwise. in this case, they did, in alarming numbers. the multiplicity of devices—one bomb exploded in new jersey on saturday morning, a second bomb was found (undetonated) in manhattan, and then early monday in new jersey a third bomb went off in the face of a police robot—gave the story additional velocity like booster stages on a rocket. third, the date 9/11 has made us all a little anxious about a repeat attack in september, and this anxiety helps to stoke coverage of any such incident—especially in new york. even if the networks were based in chicago, the story would have become big news: terrorism is to new york as hurricanes are to miami. even the near-misses are big stories. so, measured by the usual yardsticks, nobody can deny that the new york bombing story and the capture of the accused were big stories. i’d be the last person to say the press “over-covered” an incident in which 29 people were injured. but neither am i carrying a load of dread that the next pipe bomb will ignite in my world—the washington, d.c., metro area, another bull's-eye for terrorists. living, as i do, in a rational world, i interpret the clumsy bombing and misfire, and the speedy apprehension of the suspect, as evidence that the genuine threat from terrorists is low. very low. i feel safe unless i start watching tv, after which, if i let my reptilian brain take over, i feel a bit panicked. you probably feel the same way. after all, there’s no cost to overreacting to the minor threat of terrorism. the payoff for overreacting could be the preservation of your life. president barack obama has tried to convey this gist of the low threat a number of times, but whenever he tries to assure the country, it comes out sounding like he’s counseling us to put our heads in the sand. then, opportunists like trump do us no favor by inflating the event into something it isn’t. “once again someone we were told is ok turns out to be a terrorist who wants to destroy our country & its people—how did he get thru system?” trump tweeted monday afternoon. the fact that the 28-year-old rahami, born in afghanistan, is the naturalized son of an immigrant seems not to have penetrated trump's coiffure. if rahami “got through the system,” he did so as a youth. the current spate of violence doesn’t even come close to the volume of bombings recorded by fbi statisticians in an 18-month period spanning 1971 and 1972, bryan burrough reports in his book days of rage. despite more than 2,500 domestic bombings in that period, the nation did not lose its marbles; no demagogue campaigned on the peril they posed. because fear is not rational, wonks never get too far with the public by explaining that backyard swimming pools, quick drives to the supermarket for bread and milk, obesity or falling furniture are more likely to put your in death’s cross hairs than an act of terrorism. in the current atmosphere, every terror-motivated crime has come to feel like a dire assault on the homeland, exploding in the news with much more success than the actual bombs involved. though the fear is understandable, the result has a huge distorting effect on our national psyche and politics. the culture appears to be too scarred by the 9/11 attacks to place pressure-cooker bombs of the type that rahami is alleged to have built in their proper perspective. maybe the next generation, one with no direct memory of the attack, can guide us out of our paranoia. the fact is, everywhere you look in modern life, we’re safer. airline flight is safer, cars are ridiculously safe, violent crime has fallen through the floor, the food supply has never been safer, and consumer devices come with so many safety doodads attached that it takes an act of determined negligence to cut off a finger or put out an eye. helmeted to avoid concussions, gps'ed up the wing-wang to make it impossible to get lost in the forest, protected by surveillance cameras around the clock, we now live in a fully airbagged world, where accidental death is blocked by technology at almost every juncture. the paradox of all this safety is that it ends up making a lot of us feel all the more unsafe when we’re reminded that random tragedies do happen—and to clamor for an even bigger airbag when they do, even though the rational mind tells us we’ve reached a diminishing point of returns on that investment. i’m not counseling anybody to “get over” 9/11 and slough off new attacks as if they’re pinpricks. but neither am i encouraging everybody to throw themselves into a full 9/11 wallow every time a bomb explodes, even if it blows up right in manhattan. the low, low risk that a terrorist attack might injure you may not deserve the round-the-clock coverage the current incident is getting. it deserves some, and the press should feel free to pick on the 9/11 scab as much as it likes—but it’s not too much to ask the press to toss a little ointment and a bandage on the wound every now and then. ******* my autobiography will be titled a little ointment and a bandage. send your titles via email to shafer.politico@gmail.com. my email alerts self-detonate. my twitter feed has a short fuse. my rss feed burns like a grease fire.      was the terror coverage more explosive than the bombs?      
__label__1 trey gowdy really gets it on the refugee resettlement crisis in this country. and he’s not buying obama’s lame excuse of protecting widows and orphans. he’s more concerned with the american widows and orphans that will result because of terrorists being imported among these refugees. with no real vetting going on, it is a certainty. obama is deliberately and willfully bringing in jihadists to this country and seeding them all over the nation… especially in conservative strongholds. it is not islamophobic to point out bringing in an islamic invasion force per the hijrah migration is deadly to the us. the refugee act of 1980 requires a hearing in both the house and senate judiciary committees on the presidential ‘determination’ on the number of refugees the president is proposing for the upcoming fiscal year — in advance of the fiscal year. that hearing is due in one week and is extremely unlikely to take place. obama is making an absolute joke of our laws and constitution. he started out saying there would be 10,000 refugees. at the time i said it would be 250,000. now he says it will be 110,000 and last week his minions claimed it would go to 217,000. i hate it when i’m right. from tellmenow: trey gowdy is a champion for everyday americans. while speaking about the syrian refugee crisis, gowdy offered a prosecutorial assessment of president obama’s mishandling of the situation. gowdy pointed out that the president shuts down any debate about this topic by slandering those concerned about national security. he likes to paint us as islamophobic, but it is the president’s own staff that has raised red flags on this topic. this isn’t just about saving widows and orphans as obama states. there are terrorists hiding among those widows and orphans. gowdy summed up my position perfectly when he said, “what i’m really afraid of is a foreign policy that creates more widows and orphans.” senator jeff sessions scheduled a hearing that the obama state department refused to attend over the refugee crisis. gowdy is ringing some alarm bells here, but he has so far not scheduled any meetings to tackle the issue. just a meeting to discuss how new orleans became a sanctuary city. 20,000 to 30,000 syrian refugees are slated to arrive in the us next weekend… i think that matter is a bit more pressing at the moment. so, by all means… shred obama on the refugee nightmare. but gowdy should carry through and address the issue for real in the house. the only real thing on the calendar before these guys leave for the holidays is the budget continuation. gowdy is exactly right that the refugees from syria (and other islamic countries) pose a horrific national security threat. but for god’s sake, let’s go after it for real before we truly do become an islamic nation. this is why so many are turning to donald trump and voting for him. the more of this that goes down, the more likely trump is to be the next commander-in-chief.        trey gowdy gives epic speech on syrian refugees threatening americans!

__label__1 in case it wasn’t clear enough already, black lives matter truly is an anti-police group. we’ve all heard the talking point before, that they’re “anti-police brutality, not anti-police” but their actions betray them. one of the co-founders of the blm movement, alicia garzia, proved that the movement was anti-cop just the other day when she called for “cop-free” zones. she had explained (as quoted in the daily caller) that “the united states gives too much respect to police officers, explaining that when police do wrong, a few bad cops are blamed, rather than a “corroded and corrupt system.” she concluded that “quite frankly, many of our [black lives matter] members are continuing to investigate what it would mean to have police-free communities. i think what we’ve continued to see over time is that no moral appeal is actually stopping the deaths of black people, whether they be armed or unarmed.” does she not realize that more black lives would be lost if their communities lacked police? apparently not. we’ve seen the horrible chants of blm before, whether it be “what do we want? dead cops!” or “pigs in a blanket, fry em like bacon!” and now they have a new one. as breitbart reported: at least one black lives matter protester in houston was reported to yell “f**k blue lives” while others chanted “pig, pig, bang, bang.” the anti-police rhetoric came during a protest march in houston’s predominantly black historic third ward on saturday evening. the protest began in mcgregor park after the release of the dashcam video by charlotte, north carolina, police showing the shooting of keith lamont scott, a black man, by a black police officer. on september 22, a white female officer in tulsa was charged with first-degree manslaughter after she shot and killed terence crutcher. as reported by breitbart news and the ap, officer betty shelby was charged after dashcam and aerial footage showed the shooting and crutcher walking away from the officer with his arms in the air. the footage does not include a clear view of when the officer fired the sole shot that killed the 40-year-old black man. at one point, a confrontation developed between the protesters and police, according to the houston chronicle’s keri blakinger. the standoff occurred in a parking lot on the university of houston campus. ultimately, the protesters backed up and took a different path. “f**k blue lives,” shouted one protester that blakinger described as “particularly incensed.” she reported others chanting “pig, pig, bang, bang.” the protesters occasionally blocked street intersections remained peaceful and out of the flow of traffic during the protest. these are the crazies that hillary clinton is sympathizing with. is there any surprise that the largest police union in america endorsed trump? of course not. blm has only made racial tensions worse, and widened the divide between police and the public. this certainly will benefit trump this election (and harm hillary), but we can only hope that the damage they’ve done is reversible. what do you all think? isn’t it time for more of those representing us in congress to denounce blm as the terror group it is? let us know in the comments and be sure to share this post on facebook and twitter.       watch: black lives matter incite murderous chants against police “pig, pig, bang, bang…”      
__label__1 a devastating crime happened this weekend in baltimore but it’s being totally ignored by the press and black lives matter because the shooter was a criminal not a police officer. outside some rowhouses about 8:30 p.m on saturday a handful of people were shot. investigators say the shooting was a premeditated act of revenge in response to a labor day weekend shooting in which a man was fatally shot and two women were wounded, one of them pregnant. although the victims may have recognized the gunmen, authorities haven’t immediately been able to identify the suspects. attackers had a shotgun and two handguns. one of the armed men emerged from an alley and the others ran down the street and opened fire just in front of the victims. the surprised victims were a 3-year-old girl, a woman and a half dozen men. while the the 3-year-old girl and her father were standing a slight distance away from the others and that the child was not an intended target but got hit anyway. by then, most signs of the attack had been cleared away. there was a bullet hole through the rear window of a car parked on the block. neighbors sat quietly on their steps. few wanted to talk about the attack. “they’re scared,” said a woman, who declined to be identified. “they ain’t talking too much.” so far there have been 240 killings in baltimore and it appears to be from gang activity. on sunday there were 4 other shootings and an 8-year-old boy was injured adding to the city’s mayhem. i guess the question is; where are the riots? where are black lives matter? do they not really care about violence against minorities unless it’s from a police officer? sadly, black on black crime is the biggest tragedy happening to minorities and yet black lives matter remains silent. below are some statistic showing the hypocrisy of blm: ⦁while only 6% of the u.s. population is identified as black and male, 57.9% of the persons legally killed by a private citizen in self-defense were black males. ⦁ however, 73.1% of the black males legally killed by a citizen in self-defense between 2009-2012 were killed by a black citizen. ⦁ 42.6% of victims of all solved criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were black males ⦁ 89.6% of black males killed in criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were killed by another black male ⦁ 40.6% of the police officers murdered in the line of duty from 2009-2012 were killed by black males* and while black people continue to kill black people en masse, it’s harder to get killed by a police officer if you’re black than getting hit by lightening.       black gunmen wound 8 people including 3 year old girl on saturday, no protests, riots, or looting….      
__label__1 this last friday five people were shot and killed by a mass murdered at the cascade mall in burlington, washington which is located just north of seattle. arcan cetin whose a turkish born national was arrested shortly after the attack for the tragedy that took five lives. unlike what the mainstream liberal media has reported he is not a hispanic man. the police have said that the description of the assailant was based on eye witness reports. social media indicates otherwise as seen below, arcan cetin himself, people #cascademallshooting pic.twitter.com/aib2relvpp — the swog blog (@hunterswogg) september 25, 2016  news has also come to light that he was a supporter of the terrorist group isis and that he had praised its leader baghdadi. who is on the federal bureau of investigations watch list and is a notorious radical islamic terrorist.  the heavy had reported information they attained from the suspects tumblr page in which he spoke of allah and users referred to muslim paradise. look below,  the suspect is being held without bail on five counts of murder. he has a very long criminal history which also includes restraining orders as well as domestic violence charges against him. because of his prior run ins with the law he was required to take mental health and anger management courses which he complied with. but clearly they did not work what so ever otherwise five innocent people would still be alive today. by all appearances this attack seems to be another terrorist attack but the mainstream media is ignoring it. however, the police are refusing to call it that yet. the media is also refusing to refer to radical islamic terrorism. given that the presidential debate will be taking place next week this tragedy will likley play a role however small or large in it. whether it be in influencing the structure of the questions or bringing attention to questions based on gun violence and gun control.       arcan cetin: cascade mall killer praises allah and isis leader baghdadi on his tumblr page      
__label__1 when you watch this video you must have tissues out. the further into the video i went, the more i cried. it starts out with a guy saying, “this goes out to the people who support black lives matter. until i see y’all protesting black on black crime that goes on in our neighborhood every f***ing day, shut the f**ck up goin’ around saying that black lives matter. shut the f**ck up with that sh*t!” you might wonder what he’s talking about so here are some statistics from the uniform crime report’s supplemental homicide reports published annually by the federal government that support his concern on black on black crime. these numbers explain why this guy is saying that black people are killing black people… because they are and en masse: ⦁while only 6% of the u.s. population is identified as black and male, 57.9% of the persons legally killed by a private citizen in self-defense were black males. ⦁ however, 73.1% of the black males legally killed by a citizen in self-defense between 2009-2012 were killed by a black citizen. ⦁ 42.6% of victims of all solved criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were black males ⦁ 89.6% of black males killed in criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were killed by another black male ⦁ 40.6% of the police officers murdered in the line of duty from 2009-2012 were killed by black males* in 2012, white males were 38 percent of the population and committed 4,582 murders. that same year, black males were just 6.6 percent of the population but committed a staggering 5,531 murders. in other words: black people–at just a fifth of the size–committed almost 1,000 more murders than their white counterparts. the figures above highlight a horrific truth that black racialists and white liberals routinely ignore: lawbreaking black americans, young black males particularly, put themselves in close proximity to (mostly white male) police officers at rates sometimes five to 10 times higher than whites. this is a recipe for disaster. thusly…. blacka are only 13% of the population but have committed half of homicides in the united states for nearly 30 years. doj statistics show that between 1980 and 2008, black people committed 52% of homicides. in 2013, black criminals committed 38% of the murders. whites accounted for just 31 percent. there are five times fewer black people than white people in america and, yet, they consistently carry out a larger share of the crimes? given this rate, it’s no wonder that there aren’t more assistances where cops kill black criminals. the video then leads to the speech of a police captain who is reporting on the drive-by shooting of a little girl and how he now has to send his officers out there looking for suspects with a gun under their seat. the video then goes into an emotional string of video where you see police officers hesitating to a criminal with a gun pointed at them, the officer always gets shot when hesitating. it helps anyone understand why police officers must shoot when being threatened, if they don’t they will be killed. here are statistics that really show you who is getting killed more often; white criminals are. of the 1,491 persons that died from police use of force from 2009-2012: ⦁ 915 (61.4%) were white males ⦁ 481 (32.2%) were black males ⦁ 48 (3.2%) were males of other races ⦁ 28 (1.9%) were white females ⦁ 15 (1.1%) were black females ⦁ 4 (0.2%) were females of other races if there is anyone who should be afraid right now it should be: 1. white male criminals because you’re more likely to get shot by police. 2. black person who lives around black people because you are more likely to become a victim of homicide around more black people. 3. people who are in the black lives matter movement because you are increasing your risk of injury just by being in an environment where the cops are your enemy… who will protect you? plus you are literally standing among the people who commit the highest disproportionate amount of violent crimes in the nation. 4. all of us because the blm are going to destroy the greatest police force in the world that protects our bill of rights better than anyone right now. we are about to get a federalized police force and the constitution is dead without the local sheriff. 5. police officers because they’re in more danger today than ever before because of the farce of black lives matter movement giving people permission to shoot white police officers just because. now, watch this video to truly understand what police officers go through and how their hesitation may cost their life and the lives of others.        dont stop sharing this- viral video exposes major flaw of black lives matter!      
__label__1 as if donald trump’s plan to ban muslim immigration didn’t infuriate liberals enough, his plan to stop the islamization of america has another component. trump also expressed interest in deporting any muslims who express support for sharia law. in a bad turn of events for liberals, some actually attempted to hilariously defend sharia in response to the latter. cnn commenter sally kohn took to twitter, writing “hey donald trump, many progressive muslims — the ones we should support in ideaological fight against extremism — believe in sharia!!” by the way, kohn is a lesbian, and would be put to death under sharia law. there’s no disagreement among scholars of islamic law that death is the punishment for homosexuality – the debate is over how they should be killed. if that’s “progressive,” we have even more reasons to despite progressivism. i’m also sure most people aren’t on board with beheadings for apostasy, and cutting off the limbs of thieves. now, as dennis michael lynch reports, it’s clear what type of law (sharia vs. american law) many muslims in america actually prefer. fox news went to interview the somalian muslims on the streets of cedar riverside to learn the truth about how they really feel about living in america and american law. every single one of them interviewed in the following video said they prefer sharia law over american law.   “if you’re a muslim, of course you want sharia law,” they say. they believe it’s ok to kill someone if they insult mohammad. they believe it’s perfectly normal to force their daughter to marry someone when she reaches the age of 15. when asked if they would prefer to live in america or somalia, they say they would prefer somalia. and the most stunning revelation of all is a young man at the end of the interview who admits, “i’m not americanized, i just speak fluent and i an articulate what i’m trying to say, but as far as my culture and my preferences, i’m still somalian.” watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com fox news also featured another interview on the cedar riverside streets in may, where it was stated that they have at least two islamic schools that teach sharia law: scary. these results are consistent with a poll of american muslims conducted by the center for security policy last year. it found that more than half (51%) of u.s. muslims polled also believe either that they should have the choice of american or shariah courts, or that they should have their own tribunals to apply shariah. only 39% of those polled said that muslims in the u.s. should be subject to american courts. america is a tolerant nation – but that doesn’t mean we should tolerate the intolerance of sharia.       somalian muslims in minnesota admit which law they actually prefer (video)      
__label__1 the first presidential debate took place last night, and while it felt quite short in scope, it made up for it in trump’s trademark quick-witted humor. i think the night should have been called “the roast of hillary clinton,” because she got wrecked and her lies came back in full force to destroy any argument she had against trump. hillary not only started floundering, but trump turned her into a stuttering mess, complaining that she’s being picked on, as if trump was some schoolyard bully instead of a major political candidate that called her out on her countless lies. when hillary says that she’ll be blamed for every bad thing that’s ever happened, trump, without skipping a beat, he says “why not?” mic. drop. that’s the exact moment when hillary knew that her days of politicking were over. see for yourself:  this was perhaps the most satisfying series of clips i’ve seen this week. i cannot stop watching and cheering. share this everywhere. (source: youtube)       this is the exact moment when hillary realized that she lost the debate      
__label__1 seahawks quarterback russell wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for god and his fellow man. in fact, it is one of his life’s purposes to serve and help his ‘brothers and sisters’ in changing lives to be better. helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life. on the field he as a quarterback, wilson is all about winning. off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in god. for this reason, it is no surprise that when the nfl told wilson to not speak about his faith…he learned he could still share his love for god and message of hope, by his actions. words were not necessary. he has stated many times that in his life, god comes first, family and friends second, and football third. dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength. “in terms of my faith, my faith is everything: god comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,” wilson concluded. “i think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. you don’t stress out about much.” it’s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. we have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in god to do good things in their life. then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to… themselves. or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. luck? no such thing. good men’s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country. especially now in obama’s america. you might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there…if you do not share in the example that wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share… corruption can and will take root. so the nfl told him not to talk about his faith… interesting how things seem so one sided right? don’t talk about god, it hurts people’s feelings. but feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it’s heroes. with this kind of garbage happening…the truth becomes that much more obvious. words like ‘tolerance’ are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. when you have men like wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep. ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad? there is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening. …and obama’s americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.       the nfl told russell wilson not to speak about his faith, so he did something fans couldn’t believe      
__label__1 cnn news has claimed through polling that hillary clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. but others indicate otherwise. snap polls show donald trump as the debate night winner. talking points included the birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and trump’s tax returns as well as other things. look at some of the snap polls below. they include time magazine, the drudge report, cbs new york, fox 5, and news 2 nashville among many others.  donald trump took to twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. so far, hillary clinton has yet to comment on it. the cnn snap poll showed clinton at 62 percent and trump at 27 percent. which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that cnn poll. or the pool of people polled is off. 521 people were polled by cnn but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more democrat. which would explain the results. despite clinton’s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. so even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her. regardless of these apparent “winning” results, as donald trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. that he should have brought up bill clinton’s infidelity. even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. which is odd considering he apparently won. with the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. let’s not forget that julian assange promised a few months back an october surprise release on wikileaks that would destroy hillary clinton’s campaign. we all must wait and see.       here it is! the winner of the first debate was just announced, and the winner is…      
__label__1 this video is crazy! while i disagree with the ‘science’ of it, it nonetheless reveals how violent black lives matter is. before i show you the video i want you to understand that black lives matter movement has much less to do with black people than a movement to completely destroy america and change it into something it’s not. black lives matter released the platform demanding that all police departments be de-funded, race-based reparations for something that happened hundreds of years ago that has zero to do with any living person now, voting rights should be given illegal immigrants (unheard of anywhere else in the world), an end to private education and charter schools (as if the educational system didn’t suck enough in this country but they trust in the ‘system’ of public schools just not cops, a “universal basic income,” which is already provided to millions of americans called welfare and free college for blacks (not anyone else’s responsibility to pay for this but you). so basically a guy stands on the sidewalk with a black lives matter sign and not much happens. then he stands on the sidewalk with an all lives matter sign and all havoc breaks loose. people start behaving as if he has just said the worst insult about their mother. one guy even yelled “all lives don’t matter, only black lives matter”. that’s a pretty scary prospect when you have groups of people who start believing lives don’t matter. after i watched the video i read the comments and commented on a few. my jaw is hitting the floor reading how uneducated some of the commenters were… one of them believes america has had slavery for 600 years. i suggested he try simple math 2016-1492= not 600. then someone mentioned that whites invented racism and i had to point out who sold blacks into slavery from africa to the british. check out the video… based on the videos of black lives matter riots the past 2 years i am not surprised:         watch what happens when a guy holds up ‘all lives matter’ sign in black neighborhood (video)      
__label__1 for the past week rioters have been wrecking havok all across charlotte. the riots are in response to the police shooting of keith lamont scott, which has been cited as just the latest example of an unarmed black man killed by racist police brutality. scott’s wife, who filmed the shooting, told police that he wasn’t armed and was only carrying a book. as usual, the shooting happened under circumstances much more murky than those citing this as an unjustified act of police violence would like to admit. there was in fact a gun recovered at the scene, and there was a holster on scott’s leg spotted in the police dash-cam footage. those citing this as yet another “proof” that police are racist should know that the officer who shot scott was black himself, so race was not a motivating factor in the shooting. as it turns out, scott has a history of violence, and there’s no reason to think he wouldn’t have used his firearm if he had the chance. as bearing arms reported: rakeyia scott’s cry to cmpd officers that her husband, keith lamont scott, did not own a gun—even as he brandished a gun in front of them—now appears to be a calculated lie, according to rakeyia scott. on oct. 5, a gaston county district court judge granted his wife a temporary restraining order. the court order told scott not to go near his wife, three of their children and the children’s schools. he was not allowed near their gastonia apartment they’d called home since april 2014, according to court documents. he was told to turn over a black 9mm handgun he owned illegally. eleven days later, rakeyia scott voluntarily dismissed the order against her husband, writing, “he is no longer a threat to me and my family.” but three days before she got the order, keith scott had kicked her, punched their 8-year-old in the head three times and threatened to kill her with the gun, she had written. “he said he is a ‘killer’ and we should know that,” she wrote. she said the man she’d been married to since she was 18 did not have a gun permit and was a felon, having been incarcerated from april 2004 to april 2011. she checked a box saying her husband had threatened her with the gun before. the scott family is now trying to claim that the head injuries suffered by scott left him a changed man, and yet, he was still an armed felon, brandishing a gun, if not threatening with her at this time. yeah – ok. scott’s wife told officers he didn’t own a firearm during the altercation, which was clearly a lie, and one that could’ve gotten them killed. while rioters destroy charlotte, they’re doing so over a man who could’ve killed those officers, and had a wife that he himself once threatened would’ve been an accomplice to their murders.       truth comes out! keith lamont scott’s did this to his wife last year and she said “he is a killer”      
__label__1 oh hillary, when will you learn? you never count your chickens before they’re hatched. also, don’t say you’ve won when you clearly didn’t. the polls are in from last night’s debate. at first glance they do not look good for donald trump. according to focus groups from fox news and cnn, both had hillary winning last night’s debate. but were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?  according to focus groups at both fox news and cnn, democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton handily defeated republican donald trump in monday’s presidential debate. at cnn, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of clinton. and at fox, pollster frank luntz’s group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. cnn’s group was a group of voters from florida, while luntz’s group was comprised of pennsylvanians. luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that trump didn’t do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked clinton over her email scandal. however, trump “tanked” when “trying to explain why he questioned obama’s birthplace for so long.” but what no one is telling you is that another poll had trump winning 92% to 8%. drudge poll… pic.twitter.com/utcptmmrbi — greg pollowitz (@gpollowitz) september 27, 2016  after hillary’s tweet that said she won, america shot her down fast. @hillaryclinton the number one trending hashtag in the world is #trumpwon. you can't delete it like its your damn e-mails. — deplorable einzig (@anthonyeinzig) september 27, 2016  @hillaryclinton …you run and hide from media afterwards. — scottinsc (@scottinsc) september 27, 2016  @hillaryclinton ummm pic.twitter.com/j7epzxujsk — brian nielsen (@brian7280) september 27, 2016  looks like hillary has some explaining to do. some things you just can’t delete.

__label__1 there’s a plague sweeping across the nation. one that has one washed up football player feeling pretty good about himself. the attention he is getting from his nonsense, is off the charts. (i realize, i’m not helping, but you need to know what’s going on so…) it’s the kaepernick plague. it’s wiping out once respected nfl players and really ruined my monday night football when i learned the seahawks were talking a bunch of crazy talk. stupid kaepernick couldn’t leave my team alone!? anyhow… now, you see high school teams, and cheerleaders acting a fool. pulling a kaepernick number that should have never gotten an encore. this is when you know stupid has taken over… half of american adults don’t understand what kaepernick is doing or why, how do these kids understand it? seriously, they are doing what they do best at that age, jumping on a bandwagon because it’s apparently the ‘new thing’ to do. yet, kaepernick takes pride in it. in fact, so much so that he visited a high school football game in oakland. you’ll never guess in a million years the kind of stunt they pulled off in his honor. not the honor of what he is claiming to stand for…but in honor of him. (which is a lot worse btw…) here…instead of telling you, i’ll just show you. #colinkaepernick sat on the sidelines as the #nationalanthem played before the football game at castlemont high in oakland on friday. but what the high school team did as the star-spangled banner played was even more #powerful. each teen laid on their backs, their arms raised to the sky. a photo posted by ? city alert ? (@cityalert) on sep 24, 2016 at 8:39am pdt  the person who made this instagram post called this moment and action… powerful. this is a picture of an ungrateful douchebag disrespecting our nation’s warriors who have given their all for his dumb ass to live the high life, and there sprawled out all over the ground like mindless minions are our children… being brain washed by his idiocy. this was the scene last friday before castlemont’s first win of the season against canada. they took it 40-14, go knights! #knightsinaction #makeastatement #respectit #supportit a photo posted by castlemont reunion (@castlemontreunion) on sep 19, 2016 at 1:23pm pdt  but they took it a step further… they decided to honor criminals at the same time they were dishonoring actual heroes. …and there kaepernick kneels, proud. like i said earlier, it’s a plague, and it’s gaining momentum fast. way to divide and conquer kaepernick. …but just in case you forgot. if this division runs so deep that we end up on two separate sides of the nation. our side has the legal gun owners, military heroes, and first responders. that’s medical, and police officers. you’ll have the criminals and people who can’t think for themselves. you going to take care of all of them with your millions that you made because of the people sacrificing for you, that you don’t stand with? good luck man.       kaepernick takes his show on the road to watch these hs players one-up him in stupidity      
__label__1 scores of athletes have been protesting the national anthem, refusing to stand and kneeling instead. san francisco 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick kicked off the trend, claiming that he could not show respect to this country when he is so horribly “oppressed”. many other athletes followed, in solidarity with the black lives matter movement… and none of them faced any repercussions for their actions. but what happens if someone takes the opposite view, and openly opposes black lives matter? well, apparently, they get punished. seattle mariners catcher steve clevenger does not agree with the black lives matter movement, and after the riots in charlotte, he decided to make that known. he fired off a series of tweets that got a lot of attention. “blm is pathetic once again! obama you are pathetic once again! everyone involved should be locked behind bars like animals!” he wrote. he followed that up with another tweet, writing, “black people beating whites when a thug got shot holding a gun by a black officer haha shit cracks me up! keep kneeling for the anthem!”   those tweets were deleted, but not before clevenger set off a firestorm of criticism. and the mariners were not pleased: they announced he would be suspended without pay for the rest of the season.   clevenger has been sitting the bench since june due to an injury, but he still had a salary of $516,500 for the season. there are 10 days left in the season, which results in him losing just under $34,000. after being suspended, clevenger released a statement apologizing for his tweets:   the question is, why is it unacceptable for clevenger to express his opinion about black lives matter, yet it’s acceptable for other athletes to protest in favor of them?       major league baseball player gets suspended for speaking against blacklivesmatter!      
__label__1 earlier this week, as part of an interview he gave to fox news, donald trump announced he had just learned that ford motor company was about to “fire all their employees in the united states and…move to mexico.” trump went on to add that when he becomes president, ford would have to pay a 35 percent tax on any car they send back to the united states for sale. wow! that’s big news! it’s also, like 99.9 percent of what donald trump says, a gigantic lie, according to ford ceo mark fields, who told cnn: “it’s really unfortunate when politics get in the way of the facts.” cnn host poppy harlow then asked fields, would ford cut any american jobs as part of its plans to build a new manufacturing plant in mexico? to that, fields replied: “absolutely not. zero. not one job will be lost. most of our investment is here in the us. and that’s the way it will continue to be.”   ford has 85,000 workers in the united states, and that number has risen by 50 percent over the last five years. it currently employs 8,800 people in mexico, and the new plant will create 2,800 additional jobs there. so once again we see that donald trump will say anything at all in order to muddy the waters and make it appear that he is the savior of the american economy. that’s a powerful message, especially in the industrial heartland–states like michigan, ohio, pennsylvania, and wisconsin–where trump is hoping to score big on election day. but trump has financially screwed over thousands of small businesses and vendors over the years to have any legitimate clout on the economic issue. all he offers is more tax cuts for the rich and empty words. and lies. lots and lots of lies. tax those and we could pay off the national debt. featured image via business trajectory        ford motor ceo says trump is lying again! company is not moving u.s. operations to mexico      
__label__1 the new york times has announced that law enforcement have captured the man wanted in connection to this weekend’s improvised explosive detonation in chelsea, which injured 29. after a lengthy firefight which left one police officer with non-life threatening wounds, ahmad khan rahami was taken into custody in linden, new jersey. the police said there was “conclusive” evidence that rahami was connected to several other devices that had failed to detonate. they were able to identify him from photos on a cellphone that had been used as a detonator but did not explode. rahami is a naturalized citizen, born in afghanistan in 1988. it is unclear whether or not he was a refugee or when he came to the united states. he lived in elizabeth, nj, where his family operated a fried chicken restaurant. regulars at the first american fried chicken resturaunt described mr. rahami as “friendly,” noting that he dressed in western clothing and was obsessed with “fast cars.” there are no connections as of yet to the any international terror or any indication of religious radicalization. while republican nominee donald trump will surely use this as an excuse to double down on his anti-muslim and anti-refugee platform, it should be noted that thanks to the vigilance of american citizens and the rapid response of law enforcement, there have been no deaths from the bombings and the suspect was captured extremely quickly. no change of our already lengthy vetting process would have prevented mr. rahami from entering the country; the parts of the ieds are purchasable at any hardware store. we cannot allow the right-wing to use this as an evidence that their discriminatory isolationism would protect us better – because it won’t. this is the most important image of the day: fyi ahmad khan rahami—you were lied to the “enemy” you bombed is instead taking the time to provide you medical aid pic.twitter.com/og1ypmqjqw — qasim rashid, esq.

__label__1 the so called “small government” republicans running the state of michigan are so fond of letting communities run their own affairs that they’ve blocked the city of flint from being able to sue the state after the governor’s specially-appointed “emergency manager” made a series of decisions that led to the mass poisoning of thousands with lead-tainted water. just days after flint’s mayor karen weaver indicated that her town might sue the state, republican governor rick snyder and his appointed five-man receivership transition advisory board changed the rules, preventing the city from suing without approval from the advisory board. house speaker kevin cotter (r-mt. pleasant) complained that “a reckless lawsuit could throw the state budget into disarray and undermine everything we’ve done for the city.” they’ve done quite enough to make the lives of flint citizens worse already. gov. snyder’s senseless tea party tax cuts blew gigantic holes in the state budget, prompting him to appoint emergency “managers” to rule bankrupt cities without any oversight from local governments. those managers then arranged the switch from the detroit water system to the heavily polluted flint river water, ostensibly to “save money” but accusations of orchestrating a conspiracy to privatize the water company make the situation even murkier. released emails showed that the governor’s office ignored and dismissed complaints from the concerned consumers, all the while charging them the most expensive water prices in the country and hiding the fact that their water was tainted with lead and other dangerous toxins for nearly a year after the administration had learned of the contamination. now, the so-called “small government” conservatives are blocking the city from seeking justice in the gross mismanagement and mass poisoning of its citizens. it’s a hypocrisy that has played out time and time again in red midwestern states; republican politicians scream and howl about the tyranny of the obama administration but then decide to, say, ban cities in oklahoma from banning fracking, where the land has become so unstable from fracking operations that earthquakes are now a weekly occurrence. it’s just another piece of evidence which shows that republicans only exist to serve their corporate masters; they don’t even pretend to respect the opinions and rights of the people they supposedly represent.      just in: michigan republicans ban flint from suing gov. snyder over mass poisoning      
__label__1 famed economist and former labor secretary robert reich posted an interaction he recently had with a trump supporter that demonstrates just how deeply this ridiculous misconception that donald trump is a “good businessman” has sunk into the public consciousness.  the idea that we need a “successful businessman” as a president at all is very concerning. businessmen only care about one thing – their profits, and increasing those profits. a nation-state is not a business, nor should it be run like one. the leader of a nation-state must care for the well-being of his people and balancing complex international relationships with other nation-states, concerns that don’t have anything to do with the single-minded obsession with profit. and of course, trump is not a good businessman. he started out with a “small loan” of just a million dollars after being handed all the opportunities a straight white male needs to make it in america. he then lied, cheated and extorted his way to the top, and still managed to rack up four bankruptcies and over 3500 lawsuits. he is nothing but a con-man, and he will run our country into the ground just like he’s done his businesses.      robert reich met a trump supporter and blew his mind with this fact      
__label__1 famed television host and veteran montel williams got into it this weekend with trump-supporting pastor mark burns, who took to twitter to complain about the mainstream media’s refusal to jump to conclusions and immediately call the weekend’s bombing in new york “terrorism.” montel, a new yorker, was not about to let the trump apologist get away with repeating the same fear-mongering narrative that trump repeats after every terrorist attack that takes place in the west. montel called him and trump out for being a con men, shaming him for being a pastor with the nerve to support a narcissist like trump.                  donald trump clearly believes that he is a minor deity and has no concern for anything but his own ambitions, and pastor burns’ support for him is an obviously opportunistic move by a man willing to sacrifice his principles for money. williams is absolutely right to call him out on it. a bombing suspect over the explosion in chelsea and the placing of several other improvised explosive devices throughout new jersey is in custody.      montel williams calls out trump pastor for celebrating nyc bombing, sparks twitter war      
__label__1 in another disgusting display of donald’s trump selfish priorities, the republican presidential nominee rushed to defend himself and the ignorant comments he made on the new york city bombings immediately after the attack, before having any official information on the matter whatsoever. facing major backlash from the media for his audacity, donald trump decided to double-down on his irresponsible comments instead of admitting he had spoken out of turn. “the donald” claimed that not only was he was right to rush to call the attack a “bomb,” he also deserved credit from the media for having “predicted it” before they confirmed it, when in fact the media was busy doing their due diligence to present the facts and not report the event so carelessly. trump went on fox news to say, “what i said was exactly correct. i should be a newscaster because i called it before the news. but what i said was exactly correct and everybody says, “while he was right, he called it too soon.” donald trump’s priorities are clearer now more than ever. time after time, whenever tragedy strikes, trump finds a way to make it about himself – no condolences for the 29 injured, and his self-aggrandizing knows no bounds, even when there are american lives at stake, and sensitive material that needs to be treated with careful consideration. as of this morning, a suspect is in custody. is this the way we should expect donald trump to behave if elected commander-in chief? not on our watch. .@realdonaldtrump slams “dishonest” cnn for editing out clinton reference to nyc explosion as ‘bombing’ pic.twitter.com/eg2yy63b4y — fox & friends (@foxandfriends) september 19, 2016       a joyous trump cheers about nyc bombing, demands credit for “predicting it”      
__label__0 the bribery and corruption trial for new jersey democratic sen. bob menendez will be delayed while he seeks supreme court intervention in his case, a federal court has ordered. the justice dept. had asked that menendez's trial move ahead after the third circuit of appeals rejected his bid to the have the allegations against him thrown out. story continued below but the third circuit ruled on monday that the trial will be delayed while menendez petitions the supreme court to hear his appeal. that means that any trial — if it does take place — likely won't happen before 2017. menendez was indicted in april 2015 for allegedly accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in improper gifts and campaign contributions as bribes in exchange for using his office to help dr. salomon melgen, a longtime friend and major campaign contributor. the justice dept. alleges menendez received nearly $1 million worth of gifts and campaign contributions from melgen. in turn, menendez allegedly intervened on melgen’s behalf in a multimillion-dollar billing dispute with the centers for medicare & medicaid services and attempted to enforce a $500 million port security contract with the dominican republic, as well as obtaining visa applications for several of melgen’s girlfriends. menendez has argued that under the speech or debate clause — a constitutional privilege that shields lawmakers and staff from legal action over legitimate legislative activities — he could not be charged with improperly aiding melgen. he asked the third circuit to overrule a lower court, which had let the justice department's case against him move forward. the third circuit refused to dismiss the case, but did grant menendez's request to delay the trial.      menendez's bribery trial delayed as he seeks supreme court intervention      
__label__0 saudi arabia is mounting a last-ditch campaign to scuttle legislation allowing families of victims of the sept. 11, 2001 attacks to sue the kingdom — and they're enlisting major american companies to make an economic case against the bill. general electric, dow chemical, boeing and chevron are among the corporate titans that have weighed in against the justice against sponsors of terrorism act, or jasta, which passed both chambers unanimously and was vetoed on friday, according to people familiar with the effort. the companies are acting quietly to avoid the perception of opposing victims of terrorism, but they're responding to saudi arguments that their own corporate assets in the kingdom could be at risk if the law takes effect. story continued below meanwhile, trent lott, the former senate majority leader who now co-leads squire patton boggs' lobbying group, e-mailed senate legislative directors on monday warning that the bill could lead other countries to withdraw their assets from the united states and retaliate with laws allowing claims against american government actions. "many foreign entities have long-standing, intimate relations with u.s. financial institutions that they would undoubtedly unwind, to the further detriment of the u.s. economy," reads one of the attachments, obtained by politico. "american corporations with interests abroad may be at risk of retaliation, a possibility recently expressed by ge and dow." still, the saudis and their agents face a significant uphill battle, with lawmakers loath to take a vote against victims of the 9/11 attacks right before an election. there was little public opposition to the bill as it made its way through the capitol, and even now, efforts to tweak the bill haven't caught much traction. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) announced monday that the senate will vote wednesday on a motion to override president barack obama's veto, and if override advocates are successful there, the house will take the same vote thursday or friday, a house republican leadership aide said. but even if obama receives the first veto override of his presidency, the story won't end there: the saudis will seek a new bill to scale back the law in the lame-duck session or in the next session, after lawmakers are relieved from the heat of the campaign, people familiar with the plans said. "it's washington at its finest," one of the people said. while the white house has emphasized national security to justify rejecting the bill, enlisting business interests could prove influential with lawmakers representing places where the companies have significant economic footprints. companies could lose favored access to the saudi market and see their own assets subject to seizure in lawsuits, just as saudi holdings in the u.s. would be, people familiar with the situation said. "while i understand that the sponsors are well-intentioned, the bill potentially could have serious consequences for our country's critical relationships in the middle east and with the rest of the world," ge ceo jeffrey immelt wrote in a sept. 22 letter to mcconnell obtained by politico. "the bill is not balanced, sets a dangerous precedent, and has real potential to destabilize bilateral relationships and the global economy." in may ge committed to investing $3 billion in saudi water, energy, aviation and digital projects, part of the country's push to diversify its economy from oil. one source familiar with boeing's effort said the company wrote in the letter that the victims’ families deserve justice but argued that the economic consequences of the bill were important to consider. the letter warned of potential job losses, the source said. dow chemical is also lobbying against the bill, people familiar with the campaign said. dow has several facilities in saudi arabia and boeing this year sent its first 787 jet to saudi arabian airlines. chevron, which has an oil field and chemical plants in the kingdom, reported lobbying on the bill last quarter, disclosure show. several financial firms are also monitoring the legislation but not taking a stand on it. the saudis are now spending more than $250,000 a month fighting the bill, retaining powerhouses brownstein hyatt farber schreck, glover park group, sphere consulting and squire patton boggs. besides working with companies invested in saudi arabia, the lobbyists are directly contacting lawmakers, placing opinion articles and seeking support from think tank scholars. gop sens. lindsey graham of south carolina and bob corker of tennessee are trying to hammer out a compromise that would soften the bill, bringing it in line with previously proposed versions rather than keeping the harsher language that just passed. a proposed amendment obtained by politico — an effort that one person said was led primarily by graham — suggests restoring an exemption for discretionary government actions, which the document says would prevent american interference in foreign countries' internal policies and vice versa. a graham spokesman declined to comment on the language. graham, who had voiced concerns about the legislation, said in an interview last week that discussions to address those issues were "not at the level i would appreciate." "we'll see," graham said then.

__label__0 last october, hillary clinton and her top aides were debating one of those seemingly trivial yet politically consequential decisions that often bedevil a me generation candidate in the youtube era. should clinton, at times cautious to the point of rigidity, sing a boozy ballad with her saturday night live impersonator kate mckinnon at the end of her turn as “val the bartender?” story continued below the internal debate ebbed back and forth -- the candidate herself was ambivalent and some aides thought it would make her look silly. quietly, they reached out to philippe reines, a former senate and state department aide who hadn’t been invited to work on the 2016 campaign, yet had always helped to manage her big-stage moments in the past. reines urged her to do it. he flew with clinton in a private jet to new york, negotiated some details of her appearance with the writers at nbc, and stood backstage while she was warbling “lean on me” to provide moral support, according to two people familiar with the situation. the selection of the colorful, combative, cloak-and-dagger, defiantly wise-ass reines as donald trump’s stand-in during debate prep sessions, first reported by the new york times on saturday, came as a surprise to many outsiders. the idea: clinton’s in-house trump to be someone with no vested interest in pulling a punch -- like snl alum al franken, the minnesota senator; or financier robert wolf, who lobbied for the gig. but it was no shock to the people who know the candidate or the 46-year-old reines, who lives a bachelor’s life in washington with two doted-upon cats named after saddam hussein’s sons, uday and qusay. clinton, facing what could be the biggest night of her political life on monday when she squares off against trump in the first presidential debate of 2016, made an intuitive, even predictable choice, turning to a member of the tiny inner circle she has often relied on in times of maximum stress. the fact that she would tap a trusted defender to portray her most savage enemy says a lot about clinton’s management style, and her circle-the-wagons psyche even during times when other politicians might reach outside for help. there’s staff, and then there’s the palace guard – and reines, despite an up-and-down career with clinton, is practically jaime lannister. “the debate prep team is made up of people who are really comfortable with her and she's comfortable with them,” said clinton’s 2008 campaign manager patti solis doyle, who began her career as young member of clinton’s hillaryland posse in the east wing in the 1990s. “everybody’s always saying hillary needs to project her authentic self, but philippe is one of the only ones who knows what that is, and knows how to get her to go along with that,” said a person who knows both. “he’s the one who urges her to abandon the caution, to go for it. and she’ll listen to him, and that’s because she trusts him.” clinton’s relaxed snl appearance, self-deprecating but dignified spot, shows why. she flubbed the song but laughed her way through it – and it worked. that hasn’t always been the case for a 68-year-old pop culture staple who struggles to understand pop culture: many on her staff still regret letting the boss do a deeply awkward version of the "nae nae" dance on the ellen show. clinton also trusts reines precisely because he shares her skepticism – bordering on hostility – toward most of the d.c. and national political press to whom he routinely refers as “idiots” or worse in private conversation. he’s famous for his flame-out emails to reporters over the years -- calling former politico blogger and current buzzfeed editor-in-chief ben smith a moron in a 2008 email, telling the late buzzfeed correspondent michael hastings to f—k off in another, and challenging yours truly in 2009 to take a lie-detector test after it was suggested reines was scheming to force caroline kennedy out of contention for clinton’s vacated senate seat in new york. clinton aides expressed astonishment that the fake trump’s identity hadn’t been ferreted out sooner – reines has, according to one person with direct knowledge of his involvement, participated in as many as a half-dozen mock debates and more relaxed moot-court sessions, peppering the candidate with lines cribbed from trump’s primary debates and personal attacks meant to keep the candidate off balance. “nothing is really off-limits,” the person told politico. “in some ways it’s easier for him to say these nasty things to her because she knows he has her best interests at heart.” his brushes with the media – and his flamethrower reputation with fellow staffers – left him largely on the sidelines in 2008 until he emerged, late in the primaries, as a travelling adviser and pr bodyguard for chelsea clinton – and, consequentially, as a late add to her debate-prep team. reines’ relationship with hillary clinton is personally close, but has been professionally rocky from time to time; she has long told people she likes him “because he makes me laugh,” but has lectured him for picking public fights and nearly sacked him when he worked for her in the senate for a variety of over-the-top transgressions, according to former clinton staffers. controversy followed him to foggy bottom, where he waged endless turf battles and was rapped over the knuckles in an inspector general’s report. and clinton was none too happy when reines, who has a weakness for too-clever-by-half schemes, handed her a staples “reset” button to deliver to dour russian foreign minister sergei lavrov – only to be told the cyrillic inscription was wrong. but reines endeared himself in other ways, and exhibited skills that serve him in his role as debate stand-in. in 2007, reines – then a member of clinton’s senate staff – oversaw an effort to discredit and defuse a pair of potentially damaging biographies of his boss. he obtained bootlegged pre-publication printouts of the tomes from various sources and distributed the contents to a team of researchers who scoured the texts for errors, inconsistencies and off-key passages he later trotted out in clinton’s defense. “is it possible to quote me yawning?” reines said when asked to summarize the contents of an investigative biography penned by two new york times scribes. she loved that one, and has rewarded him with loyalty, even when other called for his scalp. when clinton accepted barack obama’s invitation to run the state department in late 2008, obama’s deputy chief of staff jim messina tried to block his appointment as a strategic adviser assigned to clinton’s personal staff – and the new secretary overruled the decision and installed reines as a central member of a management team that included longtime clinton confidante cheryl mills, aide-de-camp huma abedin and jake sullivan, who is now her campaign policy chief. prior to the democratic convention in late july, reines, who works at a consulting firm that specializes in defense and foreign policy, had been speaking with clinton from time to time on messaging and press issues, but “not in a regular, systematic way,” according to one clinton insider. around the time of clinton’s snl appearance, reines accompanied clinton on a flight to a town hall in new hampshire moderated by reines’ friend, “today” show co-host savannah guthrie – but he kept a low profile after that. then, after the democratic national convention, clinton’s staff began informally kicking around names for people to play trump – a list that included franken, along with entrepreneur and reality show host mark cuban. the sticking point with all of those people, sources told politico, was the candidate’s comfort level. it’s not clear who came up with the idea of tapping him but sullivan, abedin and karen dunn, one of the lawyers overseeing debate prep sessions (and a reines friend), backed the idea – and clinton quickly approved. there was another consideration: reines had a day job, but controlled his own hours, and the trump role, above all, requires “someone who has lots and lots of free time,” according to one brooklyn aide. it also required days of cramming, along with hours of youtube-watching to replicate trump’s distinctive speech patterns and habitual lines of attack. yet there was one skill reines didn’t have to study up on: new york attitude. “i was a good bush for gore because i am stupid but cocky,” said paul begala, a central player in al gore’s ill-fated 2000 debate prep effort. “philippe is a good trump for hillary because he is clever but obnoxious.” annie karni and rebecca morin contributed.      how hillary chose her donald      
__label__0 sen. bernie sanders on monday night warned that the heavily hyped debate between donald trump and hillary clinton is "not a night of entertainment." clinton's former rival and current surrogate made the rounds on the cable news networks as the first showdown neared, laying out the stakes of the contest that has tightened in the last couple weeks. story continued below “i think the hardest part is understanding that despite what the media may think, that this is not a night of entertainment. it's not a super bowl. it's not the world series,” he said. “tonight, the american people are going to be looking at somebody who will have enormous power in influencing the direction of our country, 320 million people, and the rest of the world. and i hope that we focus on the issues, the differences between the candidates.” sanders criticized trump on a number of issues, including tax breaks for the rich, climate change, and his possible choice of supreme court justices. “donald trump will appoint another conservative,” he said, adding, “which means that citizens united, the disastrous supreme court decisions that allow billionaires like sheldon adelson and the koch brothers to buy elections and undermine american democracy.” when questioned over his recent comments saying clinton needs to “get away from this personality stuff” and “start talking about the real issues,” he shot back, “it's not a criticism of her. it's a criticism of the media. let's talk about which candidate is going to be better for working families.” sanders said clinton knows she is up against a skilled showman, saying, “donald trump is an excellent entertainer. he's had successful tv shows. that's his campaign. it's entertainment.” offering advice for clinton, he continued, “i would say in contrast what she has got to do is focus on the real issues. stay focused on the issues impacting the american people.” the senator offered more criticism of trump, taking aim at his divisive rhetoric by saying, “donald trump is making the cornerstone of his campaign, in fact, bigotry. dividing us up. latinos and blacks, and muslims. trying to divide our nation up.” he said that he hoped the candidates would be respectful of each other and that there is an “intelligent debate on the real issues facing the families, working families, of america.”      sanders warns that debate is 'not a night of entertainment'

__label__0 vermont sen. bernie sanders is planning a “very, very vigorous” travel schedule to campaign on behalf of hillary clinton in the weeks leading up to the november election, he said monday. sanders, in an interview before monday night’s first general election debate, told msnbc’s brian williams and rachel maddow that he plans to “go all over this country” to advocate for clinton, the democratic nominee and his former opponent in the party’s often-contentious primary elections. story continued below “we’re working on a schedule right now, which is going to be a very, very vigorous schedule,” sanders said. “we’re going to go all over this country. we’re going to go wherever secretary clinton’s people think that i am needed, and i am going to work as hard as i can to make sure that donald trump does not become the next president.” the two are already scheduled to appear together on wednesday at the university of new hampshire field house to discuss college affordability. clinton has struggled to capture the enthusiasm of some of sanders’ former supporters, especially the young voters who flocked to his campaign’s promise of “political revolution” and focus on campaign finance reform. when williams asked sanders how “hard” he was willing to work to campaign for clinton and her running mate, virginia sen. tim kaine, sanders reiterated his common refrain that “the election of donald trump as president would be a disaster for this country.” “i am going to do everything that i can to see that that does not happen,” sanders said. “when i campaign, i campaign very, very hard.”      sanders planning a ‘very, very vigorous’ clinton stump schedule      
__label__0 "that means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing ... and small business because most of the new jobs will come from small business" — hillary clinton it’s a favorite line of almost all politicians, and hillary clinton has used it before. but small businesses are not in fact the job creators. that role belongs to new businesses. one recent study used census data to look at job creation in 2005. it found that startups created 3.5 million net new jobs—a million more than were created in the entire private sector. in other words, non-startup businesses were responsible that year for a 1 million job decline in employment.      clinton gets it wrong on 'small business' job creation      
__label__0 hempstead, n.y. — a composed hillary clinton got under donald trump’s skin during their high-stakes showdown on monday night, with the republican nominee persistently interrupting clinton as she needled him on his business record, the size of his fortune and his relationship with the truth. for 90 minutes at hofstra university, clinton and trump clashed on style and specifics, disagreeing about foreign policy, economic plans and their readiness for the oval office. but for most of the evening, it was clinton who was driving the agenda. she rattled off crisp prepared lines and repeatedly lured trump into less politically favorable terrain, including a long discussion of why he was refusing to release his taxes. story continued below “first, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is,” clinton suggested. “second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.” the much-hyped debate opened up with momentary niceties — trump called her “secretary clinton, yes, is that okay?” — and a friendly handshake that briefly masked the tension of a knife’s edge contest that is well within the margin of error in the most crucial swing states. and in an unprecedented moment for presidential politics, the democratic nominee midway through the debate accused the republican nominee of racism. “he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior,” clinton said, during an exchange on trump’s years-long questioning of the american citizenship of president barack obama. trump soon fired back with one of the evening’s most memorable lines. “when you try to act holier than thou it really doesn’t work.” the exchange was emblematic of a debate not deep on substantive policy differences but full of attacks, with both candidates landing blows that will resonate with their established bases of support. “i have a feeling that by the end of this evening i am going to be blamed for everything,” clinton said with a smile. “why not?” trump retorted. “just join the debate by saying more crazy things,” clinton shot back. clinton seemed to gain steam as the debate went on, hitting trump in the closing minutes for his past attacks objectifying women’s appearances. the former secretary of state often appeared relaxed as trump scowled and tried to jump in during her answers. clinton had prepared for weeks for the face-off with trump, complete with briefing books and mock debates. trump has eschewed such traditional preparation and, while he landed some of the evening’s most memorable lines, his performance was far more uneven. in one of the debate’s tenser moments, trump swiped at clinton’s recent time off the campaign trail when she came down with pneumonia and holed up for debate preparation. “you decided to stay home and that's okay,” trump said with more than a hint of sarcasm. “i think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,” clinton said. “and yes, i did. and you know what else i prepared for? i prepared to be president. and i think that's a good thing.” under sustained attack, trump did not have a meltdown, even as he misrepresented key elements on his record, including citing opposition to the war in iraq despite the public record, and insisting that clinton began raising questions of obama’s citizenship. asked about his judgement toward the end of the debate, trump declared, “i think my strongest asset, maybe by far is my temperament. i have a winning temperament. i know how to win. she does not.” it was the evening’s most talked-about line both on facebook and twitter. throughout, trump stuck to knocking clinton as a predictable, talking-point driven, lifelong politician. “typical politician. all talk. no action. sounds good. doesn’t work. never gonna happen,” trump said in a staccato summation of his debate plan. in the closing minutes, trump summarized his appeal again. “hillary has experience,” trump said. “but it’s bad experience.” the two candidates sniped about nearly everything from climate change to the economy to isis to trade to their records. one of the longest exchanges came not on tax policy — but trump’s refusal to release his taxes, breaking decades of precedent for presidential candidates. trump got a rise out of the audience – against the debate’s ground rules of silence from the crowd -- by pledging to release his tax returns if clinton releases all of the emails her staff deleted from the private email server she used as secretary of state. “i will release my tax returns, against my lawyer's wishes, when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,” trump declared. “so it's negotiable?” moderator lester holt asked, with trump shooting back, “it's not negotiable, no.” clinton tried to turn the attack on her private email use back on trump, who had previously said he wouldn’t release his tax returns until a routine audit is completed. “i think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. for 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns,” clinton said. clinton tried to direct viewers to her website for real-time fact-checking of trump. trump directed viewers there, too, at one point. “she tells you how to fight isis on her website. i don't think general douglas macarthur would like that too much,” trump said of the 20thcentury general. “at least i have a plan to fight isis,” clinton said. “no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. no wonder you've been fighting isis your entire adult life,” trump said about a group that has only existed for a few years. trump didn’t just tangle with clinton — but with holt. when trump said, despite the public record, that he was opposed to the war in iraq, holt interjected “the record shows otherwise,” holt said. “the record shows that i’m right,” trump said. back and forth, they went. when clinton finally got her turn, she exclaimed, “whew! okay…” clinton more than once made accusations that caused trump to blurt out interruptions, referring to him only by his first name. “donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis,” she said. “that’s called business,” trump jumped in. “donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese. i think it's real,” she said at another point. “i did not say that,” trump countered. “i did not say that.” and when she hit him for his rhetoric about failing black communities, he sighed audibly. more than anything, clinton sought to make the evening a referendum on trump’s truthfulness, even as polls show the public have many questions about her own trustworthiness. “donald, i know you live in your own reality,” she said to trump during an exchange about trade, “but that is not the facts.” they went back and forth several times, but clinton ultimately got the last word.      clinton gets under trump’s skin      
__label__0 hillary clinton and donald trump mocked each other in monday's presidential debate over who is better suited to take on the islamic state. trump dismissed clinton's seriousness about the battle against the terrorist network, also known as isis or isil, by noting the democrat had laid out some of her plans on her website. story continued below "i don't think gen. macarthur would like that too much," the republican real estate mogul said. clinton shot back: "at least i have a plan to fight isis." "no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do," trump said as clinton shook her head in amusement. "no wonder you've been fighting isis your entire adult life." "please, the fact checkers, get to work," clinton responded. the islamic state is a relatively new terrorist organization, one that slowly emerged in the wake of the 2003 u.s. invasion of iraq. clinton is 68 years old. trump has in the past said he has a secret plan to fight the jihadist group in syria and iraq and that he doesn't want to reveal it so as not to give away his strategy. the two presidential candidates were debating head-to-head for the first time at hofstra university in hempstead, new york.      trump knocks clinton for posting islamic state plan on website      
__label__0 hillary clinton and donald trump wasted little time going for each other's jugulars monday, each stampeding over the other's talking points as their intensely anticipated first debate began. each candidate knows that the perception of their performance — from their command of policy issues and ability to articulate a vision for the country to their ability to parry barbs and attacks from their rival — could set the trajectory for the rest of the campaign. here are the most memorable and important moments of the night: story continued below 1) trump: clinton doesn’t look presidential trump reiterated that clinton “doesn’t have the look” of a president and said “she doesn’t have the stamina.” clinton had a quick rebuke. “well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.” clinton attempted to turn the topic back to trump’s derogatory comments toward women, invoking a beauty pageant contestant she claimed trump had called “ms. piggy” and “ms. housekeeping.” “donald, she has a name,” clinton said, as trump interjected, saying, “where did you find this?” trump argued that his comments were largely aimed at rosie o’donnell (who he had a long running feud with) and then he offered a subtle suggestion he had considered invoking of the clintons’ marital strife – including her husband’s infidelity. “i said to myself, i can't do it. i just can't do it. it's inappropriate. it's not nice,” he said. “but she's (spent) hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads even me, many of which are untrue, and they're misrepresentations, and i will tell you this, lester, it's not nice, and i don't deserve that, but it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.” 2) trump to americans on racial healing: 'i say nothing' as holt pressed trump on his role in perpetuating the birther controversy against president barack obama, he asked trump what he’d say to americans about the need for racial healing. “i say nothing,” trump replied, “because i was able to get him to produce [his birth certificate]. he should have produced it a long time before. i say nothing.” trump struggled to respond to charges that he fomented the debunked claim that obama was born outside the united states for years after obama produced his long-form birth certificate. instead, he reiterated his claim that clinton’s own advisers pushed the controversy during their divisive primary in 2008. “i'll tell you just simple to say, sidney blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of secretary clinton. and her campaign manager, patty doyle went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against president obama fought very hard, and you can go look it up and you can check it out,” he said. “if you look at cnn this past week, patty doyle was on wolf blitzer saying that this happened, blumenthal sent mcclatchy to kenya to find out about it, they were pressing very hard. they failed to get the birth certificate.” “i was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and i think i did a good job,” he continued, adding of clinton, “just like she can't bring back jobs she can't produce.” 3) the fact check fight as donald trump excoriated hillary clinton for once describing the trans-pacific partnership as the "gold standard" of trade deals, clinton shot back that he was mischaracterizing her position against the deal. "i know you live in your own reality, but those are not the facts," she said. soon after, she plugged her home page and urged viewers to visit her campaign's live trump fact check. trump cut in to plug his own website next. after a tussle over taxes, trump fired back. "look at her website. it's no different than this," he said. "she's telling us how to fight isis. she tells you how to fight isis on her website. i don't think general macarthur would like that too much." trump repeatedly slammed clinton for the obama administration's fiscal policies. she again retorted. "i have a feeling by the end of this evening i'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened," she said. "why not?" he mused. "yeah. why not? just join the debate by saying more crazy things," she said. 4) paying no income tax 'makes me smart' trump parried a question about his still-hidden tax returns by vowing emphatically to release them as soon as clinton produces 33,000 deleted emails from her private server. "i will release my tax returns, against my lawyer's wishes, when she releases her 33,000 emails that have been deleted," he said. "as soon as she releases them, i will release my tax returns and that's against my lawyers say don't do it." the audience broke into cheers, violating the rules of decorum set out by moderator lester holt. clinton replied that trump's comment was "another example of bait and switch here." "you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns? and i think there may be a couple of reasons. first, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be. third, we don't know all of his business dealings," she said, adding that he may not have paid any income tax. "that makes me smart," he interjected. 5) trump defends business practices after clinton slammed trump for "stiffing" his workers and bringing companies into bankruptcy, trump defended his dealings. "look, it's all words. it's all sound bites," he said. "i built an unbelievable company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets in the world beyond the united states and it's an unbelievable company. but on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there." as for clinton's contention about his workers, trump said: "first of all, they did get paid a lot but taking advantage of the laws of the nation. ... now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws. but i take advantage of the laws of the nation because i'm running a company." trump also seemed to contemplate losing the presidential race, noting the hotel he just opened on pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c. "if i don't get there in one way, i'm going to get to pennsylvania ave. another," he said. 6) trump hints at clinton’s stamina trump attempted to stoke his campaign’s insinuation that clinton lacks the stamina to be president. in a discussion of his travels to urban areas to speak to african american voters, trump noted he’d been to detroit and philadelphia. “you've seen me, i've been all over the place. you decided to stay home and that's okay,” he said. clinton counterpunched. “i think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,” she said. “and yes, i did. and you know what else i prepared for? i prepared to be president. and i think that's a good thing." 7) trump to clinton: 'we agree.' the first interaction of the night wasn't the haymaker many people expected. trump's first comment directed at clinton was about an area of agreement: child care. "as far as child care is concerned and so many other things, i think hillary and i agree on that," trump said after clinton opened with a call for more family friendly economic policies. "we probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do but perhaps we'll be talking about that later." 8) trump continues to mislead on his iraq war stance trump continued to mislead on his position on the iraq war, insisting that he was against it prior to the invasion despite the only evidence – a 2002 howard stern interview – suggesting he was in favor of it. “i did not support the war in iraq. that is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her,” trump said of clinton. “the record shows otherwise,” holt said. trump urged reporters to call fox’s sean hannity, a close ally, to vouch for his opposition to the war beforehand. clinton said she hoped “fact checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.” 9) clinton laughs off trump’s temperament barb trump, who’s been dogged by questions about his temperament to be president, sought to turn the issue around on clinton, saying she’s actually too volatile. trump said that at the afl-cio “the other day, behind the blue screen, i don't know who you were talking to, secretary, clinton, but you were totally out of control,” he said. clinton grinned and delivered an exasperated “woo! okay.” her voice trailed off and she moved on. 10) trump backs off “rigged” suggestions trump poured cold water on the notion that he might challenge the results of the presidential election. “if she wins, i will absolutely support her,” he said. clinton set the table for trump’s walkback by saying that in democracy, “sometimes you win. sometimes you lose. but i certainly will support the outcome of this election.”      the 10 most memorable moments of the presidential debate      
__label__0 our policy reporters truth-squad the 2016 presidential debates. “we have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all the papers going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the fbi, one lie. she's lied hundreds of times to the people, to congress, and to the fbi. he's going to probably go to jail.” — donald trump trump referred to the guilty plea former vice chairman of the joint chief of staff and retired marine gen. james cartwright, who pled guilty on monday to a felony charge of making false statements to the fbi in connection with an investigation into leaks about a u.s.-israel cyber operation to undermine iran’s nuclear program. a number of statements clinton made about her use of a private email server have turned out to be dubious or inaccurate, although fbi director james comey has said he does not believe that clinton made false statements to his agency during its investigation. republican lawmakers have questioned several of clinton’s statements, including her claim that none of her emails were marked classified, when three had portion markings for classified records — but not proper markings at the top and bottom. other clinton statements have also been questioned, although she often couched them as an inability to recall certain events, making it difficult to label them as lies. clinton said last week in written answers to a federal lawsuit that she did not recall any communcation with computer aide bryan pagliano about management or preservation of records in her account, but a conservative group said it has a 2012 email exchange between clinton and pagliano about her not receiving messages on her blackberry. during the court hearing this week, cartwright admitted that he provided and confirmed classified information to one reporter and confirmed classified information to another, although as part of a plea bargain he pled guilty to lying to investigators and not to leaking, which could have carried a more severe penalty. he could receive up to five years in prison on the lying charge. "aleppo is a disaster. it is a humanitarian nightmare, but it has fallen...from any standpoint." - trump donald trump has said in two debates the syrian city "has fallen" or "has basically fallen." while the situation has been described as dire, the city is still contested. forces of the syrian government of bashar al-assad, backed by russian air strikes are still facing off against syrian rebel forces. “if you look at your voter rolls, you'll see millions of people that are registered to vote. millions. this isn't coming from me. this is coming from pew report and other places. millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.” — donald trump tonight, donald trump tonight cited a pew center on the states report which found that around 24 million voter registrations in the u.s. are either invalid or are very inaccurate. the report goes further and finds that 1.8 million dead people are actually listed as voters. “voter registration in the united states largely reflects its 19th-century origins and has not kept pace with advancing technology and a mobile society,” the report’s authors write, adding that “states’ systems must be brought into the 21st century to be more accurate, cost-effective, and efficient.” that noted, the report did not say that these registrants had in fact voted — nor did it suggest that voter fraud is commonplace as trump has claimed in the past. “the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent. next year, they're going to go up over 100 percent.” — donald trump in tonight's debate, trump went even further on his claims about obamacare premium increases than he has in the past. there are states with extremely high premium increases slated for obamacare plans in 2017 — some states, like minnesota and oklahoma, have reported that average rate increases will top 60 percent and 70 percent. but those numbers aren’t reflective of what’s going on nationally, even if there are outliers where rate increases are especially large. premium increases will vary highly depending on the local market and insurance company. the large premium increases trump cited do not tell the entire story, and they do not account for the government subsidies that millions of americans can receive under the health care law to lower their monthly premiums. “what i have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt.” — hillary clinton this is a gray area. clinton’s planned tax increases would boost revenues by about $1.4 trillion over a decade, according to the tax policy center. but she’s also proposed increasing spending on a handful of policy priorities, and it’s not clear how she would pay for all of her plans. for instance, she has said she would finance infrastructure investments with “business tax reform,” but hasn’t detailed what that would look like. the committee for a responsible federal budget estimated that clinton’s policies would add $200 billion to the debt over 10 years, when measured against the projected levels under current law. (trump’s plans, the group found, would add $5.3 trillion to the debt.) ultimately, it’s hard to measure without more detailed policy proposals. “i believe it was her campaign that did it just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where i was wondering what happened with my rally in chicago and other rallies where we had such violence. she's the one and obama that caused the violence. they hired people. they paid them $1500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.” – donald trump getting one thing out of the way. there's no evidence president barack obama had any role in violence at trump rallies. for clinton and her campaign, it's more complicated. two democratic political operatives with ties to her white house bid have indeed been caught up in a conservative group’s sting operation that appears to suggest efforts to send plants into the trump's rallies to cause trouble. the democrats — robert creamer, the husband of illinois rep. jan schakowsky, and contractor scott foval — both have left their jobs this week after several edited videos appeared produced by conservative activist james o’keefe and his group project veritas action. in one of the videos, foval, the national field director for americans united for change, discussed with an o’keefe operative, who was posing as an intern, a strategy that included sending plants into trump rallies to pick fights with his supporters. “i mean, honestly, it’s not hard to get some of these assholes to pop off,” he says in the video. “it’s a matter of showing up, to want to get into their rally, in a planned parenthood t-shirt. or ‘trump is a nazi,’ you know. you can message to draw them out, and draw them out to punch you.” in another video, foval calls himself “the white hat” while and describes creamer’s group, democracy partners, as the “dark hat.” foval was fired monday. both the clinton campaign and the dnc have condemned the tactics described in the videos while also denying playing any role in sending protestors into trump rallies. interim dnc chair donna brazile in a statement reported by cnn also turned the tables on o’keefe, calling him “a convicted criminal with a history of doctoring video to advance his ideological agenda.” creamer, who stepped down from his post tuesday, told cnn that foval’s comments were “flat out wrong.” he also issued a statement saying his firm “has recently been the victim of a well-funded, systematic spy operation that is the modern day equivalent of the watergate burglars.” “the plot involved the use of trained operatives using false identifications, disguises and elaborate false covers to infiltrate our firm and others, in order to steal campaign plans, and goad unsuspecting individuals into making careless statements on hidden cameras,” he said. "well, you know, once again donald is implying he didn't support the invasion of iraq. i said it was a mistake. i said that years ago. he has consistently denied what is… what is a very clear fact that before the invasion he supported it. google donald trump iraq and you'll see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of iraq." — hillary clinton "wrong." — donald trump trump has repeatedly claimed he opposed the war in iraq, but the public record suggests the opposite. during a 2002 interview with howard stern, trump was asked if he supported invading iraq. “yeah, i guess so,” trump responded. “i wish the first time it was done correctly.” these comments were first unearthed by buzzfeed earlier this year and show that trump was at best ambivalent about the war — but there is no public record of him opposing it. “hillary wants to give amnesty. she wants to have open borders.” — donald trump by most metrics, describing clinton’s immigration plan as “amnesty” is a mischaracterization. clinton’s immigration plan says she’ll “introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to full and equal citizenship within her first 100 days in office.” according to politifact, clinton supports two programs for deferred action designation by the department of homeland security — but that’s not the same as amnesty, which the legal dictionary defines as “a blanket abolition of an offense by the government, with the legal result that those charged or convicted have the charge or conviction wiped out.” clinton also supported “gang of eight” immigration reform plan that called for enhanced border security and e-verify. debate moderator chris wallace pointed out that clinton used the phrase “open borders” in an excerpt from a paid-speech excerpt released by wikileaks. but clinton appears to be talking about trade and energy (though it’s a little hard to see the full context, because the excerpt is only a paragraph long): “my dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.” “this is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons. he has advocated more countries getting them. japan. korea. even saudi arabia.” — hillary clinton the clinton campaign has blasted trump for being too cavalier on nuclear weapons, including advocating the spread of nuclear weapons to countries like saudi arabia, japan and south korea. on several occasions, trump indicated an openness to other nations to obtain nuclear weapons, citing the cost of the u.s. to protect countries against regional threats. “well i think maybe it’s not so bad to have japan — if japan had that nuclear threat, i’m not sure that would be a bad thing for us,” trump said in an interview with the new york times, referencing the nation's ability to protect itself against a nuclear threat from north korea. and asked by cooper if he had “no problem with japan an south korea” having nukes, trump responded: “ at some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if japan protects itself against this maniac in north korea. we're better off, frankly, if south korea is going to start to protect itself.” all noted, trump’s past statements and positions on nuclear proliferation have been contradictory. this story has been updated with additional context. "people contribute. i contribute. the money goes, 100 percent, to a lot of charities, including a lot of military.” — donald trump per the reporting of washington post’s david farenthold, trump has not contributed to his own foundation since 2008. the foundation has also been used for non-charitable purposes, including contributing illegally to a political candidate, buying a portrait of trump and settling a lawsuit. “when you ran the state department, $6 billion was missing. how do you miss $6 billion? you ran the state department. six billion was either stolen, they don't know. it is gone. $6 billion.” — donald trump “well, first of all, what he just said about the state department is not only untrue, it’s been debunked numerous times.” — hillary clinton clinton is right: trump is repeating a falsehood. short version: there was missing paperwork, not missing dollars. the washington post has the long version. “[trump] held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough… to be assaulted.” — hillary clinton “i did not say that.” — donald trump while trump has not said that explicitly, he has repeatedly suggested it over the last week. regarding people magazine reporter natasha stoynoff, who recently alleged trump forcibly kissed her in 2005, trump said last week in cincinnati: “take a look. look at her. look at her words. and you tell me what you think. i don’t think so.” during a rally in north carolina last friday, trump said of jessica leeds, the woman that accused him of groping her on an airplane in the 1980s: “believe me, she would not be my first choice. that i can tell you. you don’t know. that would not be my first choice.”      separating fact from fiction on clinton's fbi statements aleppo is in crisis, but it hasn't 'fallen' the pew study trump cited isn’t as clear-cut as trump suggests trump misleads on obamacare premium increases will clinton’s plan add to the federal debt? is clinton encouraging violence at trump's rallies? trump didn't oppose the iraq war, if anything... trump misrepresents clinton’s position on 'open borders' true: trump has advocated more countries getting nuclear weapons yes, trump used foundation money to buy a self-portrait trump is wrong: $6 billion didn’t go missing in clinton’s state dept. fact: trump suggested the women accusing him of sexual assault aren’t attractive      
__label__0 in an exchange that began about trade and economic growth and ended with donald trump’s claim that clinton has been fighting the islamic state for decades, trump repeatedly peppered clinton – running through polished responses – with interjections, a study in miniature of his disruptive challenge to her practiced presidential run. the action began when trump said clinton had taken 30 years in public service to begin thinking about productive solutions to the nation’s problems. “well, not quite that long,” clinton responded. “i think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. i think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again.” story continued below trump interjected, “he approved nafta which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.” clinton continued with an extended, number-filled defense of her record on trade, touting her ability to create jobs and boost exports. trump responded, “well you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or ...“ “i've been a senator and i have,” clinton edged in. “you haven’t done it,” trump retorted. clinton tried to regain her train of speech, but trump wouldn’t have it. “excuse me,” he shot back. “your husband signed nafta, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.” “well, that's your opinion,” clinton said. then trump unloaded on the decline of manufacturing, channeling the same anxiety and outrage over decay of the former backbone of the american economy that has fueled his insurgent campaign. “you go to new england, ohio, pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, secretary clinton,” he said. “and you will see devastation where manufacturing is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.” the exchange rumbled on, trump peppering clinton all along the way. the former secretary of state touted the virtues of her economic plan. “but you have no plan,” trump interjected. “oh, i do.” “secretary, you have no plan.” “in fact, i have written a book about it. it's called ‘stronger together.’" “that’s about all you’ve done,” trump ribbed her. clinton plowed through it: “you can pick it up tomorrow at the bookstore or at an airport near you.” after clinton urged viewers to go to her website for a real-time fact-check of trump’s claims, trump ribbed her for publishing her plan to combat the islamic state online. “you go to her website — she tells you how to fight isis on her website. i don't think general douglas macarthur would like that too much,” he said. “at least i have a plan to fight isis,” retorted clinton, a reference to her opponent’s stance that discussing his plan to combat the islamic state would only tip off the enemy and his subsequent promise to order military leaders to draw up a plan to defeat the group on his first day in office. “no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. no wonder you've been fighting isis your entire adult life.” moderator lester holt tried in vain to wrestle control of the exchange. “folks, let me --,” he began “go to — please, the fact checkers, get to work,” said clinton.      the instance when decorum went south for clinton and trump      
__label__0 “donald supported the invasion of iraq” — clinton “wrong.” — trump trump was supportive of the iraq invasion as far back as 2002, according to interviews the donald did with howard stern, which were first uncovered by buzzfeed. stern asks trump if he agreed with the bush administration trying to sell the war. he said, “yeah, i guess so.” the argument between clinton and trump then spilled over into a clash of words between trump and moderator lester holt. holt insisted trump had supported the war, referencing the stern interview. trump then claimed he'd had arguments with fox news televsion host sean hannity, in which he argued against the war. he also said the argument that he supported the war was a media "lie." he also cited a 2004 esquire interview that mentioned his criticism of the iraq invasion as proof of his opposition. that interview took place after the start of the war, and esquire has since attached a note to the article arguing that trump is misrepresenting its contents.      trump [again] says he opposed the iraq war. that's still false.      
__label__0 hillary clinton warned about cyber-threats from vladimir putin. but donald trump is just as worried about obese, couch-bound hackers. story continued below clinton called recent cyber-attacks on various democratic campaign arms, which are widely thought to be at the hands of russian intelligence, “the most recent and most troubling” infiltrations from state actors. “i know donald’s very praiseworthy of vladimir putin, but putin is playing a very tough, long game here,” clinton said. “that’s why i was so shocked when donald publicly invited putin to hack into americans'” systems, clinton said, adding that such comments make trump “unfit to be the commander in chief.” but trump said he’s not convinced that putin is behind the attacks. “she said russia, russia, russia, maybe it was. could also be china,” trump said. “could also be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.” regardless, trump didn’t miss an opportunity to highlight one of the most notable findings from the hack of the democratic national committee’s emails: that members of the party leadership were working against sen. bernie sanders’s primary challenge against clinton. “we learned that bernie sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by debbie wasserman schultz,” trump said, before referring to her subsequent ouster as the party chair. “whether that was russia, whether that was china, we don’t know.”      trump not convinced of russian hacking      
__label__0 donald trump defended his long-running questioning of president barack obama's birthplace during monday's presidential debate, while hillary clinton called it a "racist lie" that "can't be dismissed that easily." during a segment on racial healing, trump repeatedly praised himself for pushing the president to produce his long-form birth certificate in 2011. the document proved obama was born in hawaii. story continued below "i think i did a great job and a great service not only for the country but even for the president in getting him to produce his birth certificate," trump said. as moderator lester holt tried to ask trump what he would say to americans worried about the racial dimensions of birtherism, trump cut off the question and said: "i say nothing, because i was able to get him to produce it." the republican nominee also insisted that it was clinton associates who first tried to peddle false rumors that obama was born in kenya. he further pointed to clinton's tough democratic primary clash with obama in the 2008 presidential race in claiming that she had treated the president with disrespect. clinton used the exchange to raise reports of how, back in the 1970s, some of trump's properties were sued for racial discrimination because they would not rent apartments to african americans. "he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. and the birther lie was a very hurtful one," clinton said. "barack obama is a man of great dignity. and i could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him is that this was being touted and used against him." trump retorted by saying his company had settled "the suit with zero -- no admission of guilt." he also insisted that he's formed strong relationships with african americans "over the last little while."      clinton on trump's birther claim: a 'racist lie'      
__label__0 donald trump on monday again wrongly claimed that he opposed the iraq war before it started. "i did not support the war in iraq," trump said at the first presidential debate when asked how his judgment differed from that of his opponent, hillary clinton, who initially supported the war. "that is mainstream media nonsense put out by her." story continued below moderator lester holt of nbc noted that "the record shows otherwise." indeed, in september of 2002, before the u.s. invasion of iraq, trump said, "yeah, i guess so," when asked by radio host howard stern whether he supported that move. "when i did an interview with howard stern, very lightly, first time anybody's asked me, i said, 'i don't know,' essentially," trump said, going on to add that he would soon have arguments with sean hannity of fox news, who did support the war, and that there was an article from 2004 in which he appeared strongly opposed to the war. the u.s. invaded iraq in 2003. "if somebody would call up sean hannity, this was before the war started," trump said. "he and i used to have arguments about the war. i said it's a terrible and a stupid thing. it's going to destabilize the middle east. and that exactly what this has done." "my reference is to what you said in 2002," holt pressed, going on to ask how his judgment differed from clinton's. i have better judgment, i also have a much better temperament than she does, you know?" he said, going on to add, "i think my strongest asset, maybe by far is my temperament. i have a winning temperament. i know how to win. she does not." clinton, who was smiling through trump's remarks, opened with a "woo! ok," when the questions turned back to her.      trump repeats incorrect claim he opposed the iraq war from outset      
__label__0 hillary clinton didn't hold back in her attacks on donald trump monday night, but donald trump intimated that he pulled a key punch — passing on making a reference to bill clinton's past infidelities. “i was going to say something extremely rough to hillary, to her family, and i said to myself, i can't do it,” trump said in reply. “it's inappropriate. it's not nice.” story continued below trump's veiled reference followed a tough attack from clinton, who referenced his past comments about women being “pigs” and “dogs” and said trump “loves hanging around beauty contests” during monday night’s debate. “he tried to switch from looks to stamina. but this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,” clinton said. trump also said that clinton has been hitting him “with tremendous commercials. some of it's in entertainment.” trump added that rosie o’donnell, the focus of some of his comments has “been very tough to me.” clinton has spent “hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads ... many of which are untrue, and they're misrepresentations, and i will tell you this, lester, it's not nice, and i don't deserve that, but it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done,” trump added. “i’m very happy that i was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to bill clinton,” trump told reporters after the debate. “because i have a lot of respect for chelsea clinton and i just didn’t want to say what i was going to say.” and what exactly, a reporter asked, was that going to be? “i’ll tell you maybe at the next debate, we’ll see,” he responded.      trump: 'i was going to say something extremely rough' to clinton      
__label__0 hillary clinton drew applause monday night for taking a shot at donald trump over having prepared for the first presidential debate – and similarly preparing “to be president.” trump talked about his visits to “the inner cities” during a debate segment about race and policing but couldn’t resist also taking a shot at clinton, who spent multiple days preparing for the debate in recent weeks. story continued below “i just left detroit, i just left philadelphia. you've seen me, i've been all over the place. you decided to stay home and that's okay. i will tell you, i've been all over,” trump said. “i think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. and yes, i did. and you know what else i prepared for? i prepared to be president. and i think that's a good thing,” clinton said in reply.      clinton snark: preparing to be president 'a good thing'      
__label__0 you can choose one or more of the explanations for what has happened to hillary clinton in recent weeks as donald trump has closed in on her in the polls. the “fundamentals” of this year—economic and political data—have pointed to a close race for more than a year; trump has (until his recent birther nonsense) offered a more temperate version of himself; clinton has been haunted by her emails and her health; republican holdouts have been returning to the fold, another sign that the electorate will vote more and more along lines of party preference. but what is especially bedeviling the clinton campaign is that, at least until now, constituencies most critical to her campaign seem to have no sense of urgency about keeping the donald trump out of the white house. while hispanics, who backed obama in 2012 by a more than 2-1 margin, support clinton by a similar margin, they seem far less inclined to vote than they did four years ago. story continued below that is what could change now that trump threatens to actually take the white house. younger voters, who not only backed obama by landslide margins but turned out in record percentages in 2012, have until now expressed relative indifference to the campaign or have turned to the alternatives: libertarian party nominee gary johnson and the green party’s jill stein. if last week’s quinnipiac poll is right, the race among 18-to-34-year-olds looks like a four-way split: she wins only 31 percent to trump’s 26 percent. in fact, johnson runs second, with 29 percent; stein, running in low single digits nationally, pulls in 15 percent of 18-to-34 year olds. and remember: without massive support and a heavy turnout among younger voters, obama’s margins in florida and other key states would have been wiped out. yes, support for minor party candidates tend to fall when the leaves do; yes, the clinton campaign has a get-out-the-vote machine whose reputation—yet untested—is formidable. but what may be their most powerful weapon is the clear possibility that trump could win, which is why clinton’s very bad few weeks could, in the end, be very good for her. trump’s climbing numbers could finally motivate her complacent democratic base and other voters who have never been crazy about her and not especially motivated to come out to the polls, especially if she were running away with the race. here is where hillary clinton might think about channeling the arguments of two historical figures you might not normally think of in the same paragraph: oliver cromwell and john mcenroe. back in 1650, the first (and last) non-royal ruler of britain tried to dissuade the scots from declaring charles ii as king. saying, in a famous appeal: “i beseech you, in the bowels of christ, consider it possible that you may be mistaken.” three hundred and eighty one years later, in the midst of another british field of battle—wimbledon—john mcenroe saw one of his serves ruled a fault and screamed incredulously: “you cannot be serious!” somewhere between cromwell and mcenroe lies the clinton campaign’s most plausible argument to its wavering voters: get real, folks. “you’re looking at johnson and stein as a way of rejecting a corrupt, unresponsive two-party system,” england’s lord protector might say to millennials, sounding a lot like bernie sanders, “because there’s no difference between the two parties. but please be willing to consider that you might be mistaken. look back 16 years, and see what a similar vote—for ralph nader—did. his 94,000 voters in florida would have wound up giving gore a net of about 20,000 votes—more than enough to make butterfly ballots and hanging chads irrelevant. now, between launching the iraq war and the two supreme court justices bush appointed, did it really make no difference?” mcenroe—looking and sounding remarkably like elizabeth warren, who’s now out there stumping for hillary—might then chime in: “you cannot be serious if you think you have the luxury of a ‘protest’ vote for johnson or stein. if you vote as a libertarian for johnson, you will materially increase the chances of a trump presidency. look at the list of potential judges. on everything from gay rights to abortion to his own views of the first amendment, trump is on record as rejecting core libertarian principles. if you vote for jill stein as a progressive, you are helping to put in power a president whose tax plan makes the rich richer, who thinks climate chance is a hoax, who wants to abolish whole swaths of environmental protection laws. so voting for johnson or stein means you’re voting for a label—a ’libertarian,’ or a ‘progressive’—without realizing that the consequence of that vote could lead to a president who rejects everything you claim to hold dear.” there’s no guarantee that any of these arguments will work. they come, after all, at the end of a 15-month-long trump campaign that was guaranteed to collapse at countless moments (i’d list them, but anyone following this campaign has likely committed them to memory). and it still requires, as its ultimate point, an insistence that these voters summon themselves to vote for a candidate for whom they have little or no enthusiasm. obama’s supporters turned out in significant numbers because they were hungry and saw in his presidency a feast; the voters clinton must summon are being told “eat your peas because you have to.” that’s an emotional detachment that a dozen speeches heavy on policy, like the one she delivered monday, won’t repair. of course, it’s possible that trump’s own character and temperament, revealed on the debate stage or in his bizarre-world campaign appearances, will convince voters that in the end , he is a risk they are not prepared to take. but for voters unsure about clinton, relying on trump to self-destruct after what he has survived is a risk they cannot take. so, even though the scottish presbyterians rejected cromwell’s plea, and even though the officials at wimbledon did not change their call, their pleas still suggest that trump’s rise in the polls could be a powerful argument for clinton.      how hillary’s very bad september could be very good for her in november      
__label__0 president barack obama and israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu are holding what is expected to be their final meeting as heads of government on wednesday—and there is every reason to expect that this one in new york, at the united nations general assembly, will be as fruitless as previous encounters. it is no secret that u.s.-israel relations have become volatile and tense over the past eight years, with obama and netanyahu sparring over israeli settlements and the all-but-moribund peace process, iran’s nuclear program, and the uprisings of the arab spring. but the likelihood of a sputtering end to the barack-and-bibi relationship does lead one to ask: which of the two candidates who are running to replace obama next january—hillary clinton or donald trump—might do somewhat better in restoring the u.s.-israel relationship and pushing for peace? story continued below trump surrogate and former new york mayor rudy giuliani claimed at the republican convention that netanyahu and other government ministers favored trump. our sources say the israeli security cabinet is divided but on the whole views clinton as the safer course. there is, in any event, no doubt that the governing likud party has become closely aligned with republicans in recent years, and that netanyahu was betting on a mitt romney victory four years ago. “the notion that they don’t intervene in our politics and we don’t intervene in theirs is pure nonsense,” as aaron david miller, a middle east negotiator for successive u.s. administrations, has put it. “netanyahu has clearly made his preferences clear on the republican side.” but netanyahu is himself often second-guessed by israel’s national security elites. and the answer to the question of who really would be better for a future u.s.-israel alliance, a president clinton or a president trump, requires starting with a more basic issue: what does it mean to be a good ally to israel? the current israeli government seems to think that a good american ally would stop nagging jerusalem about west bank settlements, forget about the israel-palestine peace process, provide a blank check for security assistance, use military force in the region more readily, tear up the nuclear deal with iran, and also supply weapons for israel to strike iran unilaterally if it thought it was necessary at some point. hillary clinton certainly would not follow this agenda to the letter; in that sense, her administration might well share some of obama’s priorities. she clearly values the u.s.-israel alliance highly, she is committed to israel’s security, and she has credibly promised to fend off diplomatic efforts that israelis see as “delegitimizing” the jewish state whether at the u.n., through sanctions, boycotts or punitive disinvestment. at the same time, she has confirmed that the peace process and a two-state solution will be central to her israel policies. and she promises to safeguard, not tear up, the nuclear deal with iran. safeguarding means holding iran to its terms and being prepared, as obama promised in spring 2012, to use military force if needed to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. many israelis derided obama’s commitment—wrongly, in our view. but clinton’s credibility regarding the use of force should not be in doubt. on balance, we think, she would be a better president in the long run for israel. here’s why. if jerusalem hopes for an american president to renege on the nuclear deal, trump may well be their man. he has certainly bragged about his history of walking away from agreements. what happens then, however, is a question for which trump has no convincing answer. some of his advisers point to richard nixon’s “madman” theory of how to frighten rivals with the unpredictability of american leadership. but nixon, whatever his other faults, was a shrewd geo-strategist (and he had henry kissinger by his side). trump, judging by his erratic and impulsive behavior on just about any given day of this campaign, seems far too close to the madman template for anyone’s comfort—least of all a small middle eastern state that depends on a steadiness of commitment from its american protector. steadiness is one of the last words that come to mind when thinking about trump’s various statements about israel and the palestinians. he could embrace something resembling neutrality and demand a return on u.s. assistance—signature trump foreign policy themes—or, alternatively, as he put it, he could be "the most pro-israel president ever.” this uncertainty about his instincts does not bode well for alliance management. indeed, his innate isolationism and nativist demagoguery portend two kinds of trouble for u.s. relations with israel. first, trump would enter office as the only genuinely isolationist president since the 19th century—an unsettling prospect for israel, which depends heavily on u.s. internationalism (and an experience that israel, which is only 68 years old, has never had). although not, as a rule, philosophically inclined, trump has expressed a coherent view of international relations as fiercely transactional and zero sum. this view extends to alliances, as he made clear in a new york times interview in which he explicitly disavowed america’s article 5 guarantee to defend nato allies including estonia, latvia and lithuania. “if we cannot be properly reimbursed for the tremendous cost of our military protecting other countries, and in many cases the countries i’m talking about are extremely rich … then yes, i would be absolutely prepared to tell those countries, 'congratulations, you will be defending yourself.”’ in the world according to trump, alliances such as nato are inherently bad arrangements for the united states because the country is defending european allies who have little capacity to reciprocate, and who are unwilling to adequately pay for their protection. likewise, maintaining a nuclear umbrella over south korea and japan seems to be a foolish and dangerous entanglement when those countries could just as well develop and deploy nuclear weapons themselves. and, of course, ”isolationism” is a mild term for what trump conceives as the proper relationship between the u.s. and its southern neighbor. perhaps trump will make an exception to his expectation of a “return on investment” for commitment to allies, and he will stand by israel no matter what it can or cannot do for the u.s. in return. if so, however, it would be out of character. second, trump’s invective against muslims and other immigrant communities might appear in sync with israeli hard-liners—the gop nominee has indeed pointed to israel’s security barrier and security profiling of muslims as models for his own great wall on the mexican border and promised ban on muslims entering the country. but if israel’s government really prefers trump on this basis, this will drive another wedge between israel and american jews. most american jews are politically liberal, and they are particularly allergic to fear-mongering rhetoric against minorities. the experience of millennia has taught them that security for diaspora communities depends on a general climate of liberal tolerance. when demagogues single out minorities, jews have to ask themselves—are we next? so, to take a small but telling example, when trump has said that “my jews”—presumably his employees—used to say “merry christmas,” and implies that his presidency will usher in a new era in which “happy holidays” will be a euphemism of the past, american jews are not amused. the fact is, the u.s.-israel alliance needs to be nurtured for the long haul, which means facing up to its real problems and reinforcing its moral foundations. it is wrong to think that the problems between obama and netanyahu have been determined by the personalities of the two leaders. generational transformation on both sides has deepened strategic differences over the best way to manage a fragile regional balance of power, palestinian political aspirations, and the increasingly anarchic conditions in the region. israel is becoming more religious and less democratic. the united states is becoming more diverse—this, after all, is what trump’s followers are angry about—and, arguably, more liberal. surveys of young israeli jews show a sharp decline in support of israel’s identity as a democratic state, from 26.1 percent in 1998 to 14.3 percent today. the growing religious nationalist population is becoming increasingly powerful in israeli politics and society, including the israel defense force. in 1990, 2.5 percent of officer candidates self-identified as religious, compared with 26 percent in 2008. young americans, in contrast, are more liberal than their parents on matters related to israel-palestine. a recent pew survey indicated that 57 percent of self-styled “liberal democrats” sympathized with palestinians more than israel—at a time when younger democrats are more and more likely to call themselves liberal. politics in both countries appear to be tracking these trends. last may, netanyahu fired defense minister moshe yaalon for defending a senior officer’s right to criticize the government. rather than seek to shore up his coalition by replacing him with a center-left figure, netanyahu opted for the far-right wing avigdor lieberman as defense minister, creating what israeli columnist nahum barnea has called “the most radical government … in israeli history.” meanwhile, as guiliani has contended, it may well be right that the democratic party’s leftward movement could bring additional tensions to relations with israel. bernie sanders supporters on the democratic platform committee failed in the effort to include language more harshly critical of the israel occupation of the west bank. there is little doubt, however, that this represented the views of many of his younger supporters. *** what can be done to revive the u.s.-israel relationship, under either a president clinton or president trump? in our recent book on u.s.-israel relations, we suggest that one approach would be to negotiate a formal alliance enshrined in a treaty that would specify mutual responsibilities. the u.s. would undertake a legally binding commitment to defend israel from attack, particularly by iran. although the white house has already declared this commitment publicly, a solemn treaty obligation would inject it with greater credibility in iranian as well as israeli eyes. to underscore the depth of obligation, the u.s. could deploy a tripwire force—as it long did in the asia and europe—to ensure that israel’s adversaries understood that an attack on israel would be tantamount to one on americans that would bring the united states into any military conflict. in return, israel would agree to a final status accord with the palestinians along the territorial lines that the u.s. has long endorsed: the 1967 borders with mutually agreed swaps. the u.s., working closely with israel and jordan, would not only help secure the parties’ safety, but work with european donors to put the new palestinian state on a firm footing to reduce the possibility of revanchist violence. under this arrangement, the u.s. would contemplate a military assistance package that came closer to israel’s vision for the one that has just been signed, while israel’s withdrawal from the west bank would ensure robust trade ties with europe well into the future. many on both sides will say that this program entails too many risks for too uncertain a gain. israelis for whom past is prologue will argue that the practical benefits of a treaty is available at no cost. it certainly doesn’t fit with donald trump’s purely transactional view of international relations. but in an increasingly violent middle east, it behooves both countries to reconsecrate a relationship based on a shared moral and strategic vision. as a matter of moral temperament and strategic vision, hillary clinton would appear far more likely to make this happen.      barack and bibi—goodbye to all that?      
__label__0 new york — the clinton global initiative has alerted dozens of employees that their jobs will be eliminated at year’s end, even as it plans to retain some staff to continue working with donors, according to two former clinton foundation officials who remain in communication with staff. the winding down of cgi after this week’s glitzy gathering and the resulting layoffs stem from concessions made by the clinton foundation to controversies swirling around hillary clinton’s presidential campaign. story continued below but the recent moves to sunset the project have prompted controversies of their own around the clinton foundation, which administers cgi. and they presage the difficulties the clintons can be expected to face if hillary clinton wins the presidency and they move forward with plans to scale back the rest of the foundation. some foundation allies grumbled that the announcement of cgi’s elimination — and of many of its positions — was handled in an insensitive manner, according to the former officials. others predicted that retaining some staff to work with deep-pocketed government, corporate and nonprofit donors on existing programs would only feed criticism about whether some of the businessmen, companies or foreign governments that donated to the global charity got preferential treatment from hillary clinton’s state department. it’s a “bad idea” to retain cgi staff, said one of the former officials, adding, “i really think they should make a clean break, and apparently so do most staff.” cgi at its peak employed around 200 full-time staffers. many of those have sought — or accepted — new jobs in recent months as the fate of the initiative became uncertain. it’s not clear how many remain employed, precisely how many jobs are being eliminated at the end of the year or how many would be retained in 2017. a clinton foundation spokesman would not answer those questions, but he defended the foundation’s handling of cgi’s wind-down. “all full-time cgi employees will have their jobs with benefits at least through the end of the calendar year,” said the spokesman. the foundation is providing departing staff with “a wide range of resources that include career coaching, access to job leads in a variety of fields, and resume and job search strategy,” the spokesman said, explaining, “we informed cgi staff of this transition more than four months before the end of the year, and have provided information about cgi-related roles that will continue.” remaining staff will be working with government, corporate and individual partners that have pledged assistance for ongoing humanitarian projects around the world, the spokesman said. “staff will be performing a number of roles, including continuing to provide advice with respect to commitment development and commitment improvement, based on our commitment database and experience having previously developed over 3,600 commitments with our members, and continuing to facilitate introductions and partnerships between members,” the spokesman said. he added that not all of those partners give directly to the clinton foundation. the spokesman pointed to an open letter written by former president bill clinton in which he announced the sun-setting of cgi, while also crediting its partnership model for changing the face of modern philanthropy and corporate social responsibility. “it’s been one of the great honors of my life to be part of this special community, and i hope the hard work and benefits of cgi’s great staff and its members’ creative cooperation will keep rippling out into the world,” clinton wrote. in his opening remarks on monday, bill clinton said, “i think the way to end this is not on a nostalgia trip, but doing what we set up to do. which is just keep working to push the ball forward.” since clinton launched cgi in 2005, its members have made more than 3,600 commitments in areas including housing, education, workforce training sustainable energy and food systems, according to the foundation’s website. it says the commitments “have improved the lives of over 435 million people in more than 180 countries.” this is the 12th and last cgi conference, regardless of whether hillary clinton or her republican opponent donald trump win the presidency. the foundation hasn’t provided details on how cgi’s programs might continue, though many of the commitments made by cgi partners are to multi-year projects, and it is unlikely that all would wrap up at the end of this year. the foundation has provided more detail on other changes that the clinton foundation will enact if hillary clinton is elected. it will no longer accept new contributions from foreign or corporate donors and will formally change its name from the “bill, hillary and chelsea clinton foundation” to the “clinton foundation,” while bill clinton will step down from its board. cgi originally was intended as a 10-year program of the foundation. but it continued for longer, partly because it attracted so much interest — and money — from the corporate and ngo worlds and partly because it became bill clinton’s favorite showcase, according to sources who worked with the foundation. its annual meeting is a see-and-be-seen event featuring a mix of swanky parties and high-minded discussions about finding solutions to global problems ranging from climate change to childhood obesity. this week’s final gathering includes panels and parties featuring heads of state, fortune 100 ceos, hollywood actor ben affleck and world-class athletes. but it also has prompted teeth-gnashing among foundation staff and allies who are concerned that it’s an easy target for trump supporters. those concerns were exacerbated monday when bill clinton conceded that some donors may have given money to the foundation to build a relationship with the clintons or to gain access to the state department during hillary clinton’s tenure as secretary of state. trump campaign spokesman jason miller responded tuesday, asking, “doesn’t this validate claims of pay-for-play within the organization?” sponsors also seemed less eager to affiliate with cgi this year than in the past. the final meeting lists 23 sponsors, down from 33 last year and 46 at the annual meeting’s height, in 2011. notable dropouts this year include coca-cola, which sponsored the event the last three years, and barclays, a sponsor since 2010. longtime sponsor goldman sachs also declined to participate this year. some staffers grumbled after being told that they couldn’t leave after the meeting and receive severance through the end of the year, so that they could hunt for jobs full-time, said the former foundation official. instead, the former official said they are “being asked to stay until the end of december to update data into a database.” few staffers were informed about the move before it was announced in an august staff meeting by foundation ceo donna shalala and bill clinton, said the former official. since then, they’ve learned their fate on a piecemeal basis, according to two people with knowledge of the process. “it was poorly managed, treated too glibly, patronizingly, completely lacking empathy at the fact that so many young people were going to be laid off,” said the former official.      clinton foundation to lay off

__label__0 williamsburg, va. — mike pence stood with no umbrella before about 650 die-hard supporters in an at times torrid rain tuesday night, and delivered his stump speech over the chants of protesters less than 100 yards from the stage. it was a dramatic scene here in this colonial village/college town, as the skies opened up but did not deter donald trump’s running mate. story continued below “you people are awesome,” pence told the crowd as he took the stage while a steady rain poured down. he acknowledged it was a “moist evening.” when he prepared to leave the stage just over 20 minutes later to work the rope line, he conceded the night was “soggy.” “tonight, we’re showing the media and showing the world this is a movement that’s going to elect donald trump as the next president of the united states,” pence told the crowd. the outdoor rally meant vulnerability not only to the weather, but also to local permitting ordinances. a throng of about a dozen protesters with clinton-kaine signs stood just behind the press pen and sought repeatedly to disrupt the speech. “pro women, pro choice!” the group chanted at one point. “monica!” a man yelled at them. at another point the group shouted, “we are all immigrants!” “you’re all idiots!” a man nearby retorted. a chant of “you are racist!” morphed seamlessly into an “america’s already great!” chant. but whenever pence, in a soaking wet suit, hit his applause lines, the crowd drowned out the protesters. pence stuck to the message he has been hammering since the weekend, accusing hillary clinton and barack obama of a foreign policy that opened the doors for the kinds of terrorist attacks that hit new york, new jersey and minnesota on saturday. “you know, theirs is narrative of denial,” pence said of the administration and the democrats. “truth of the matter is we need a president who understands we are in a real fight against terrorists, against radical islamic terrorism, against the isis caliphate. and when donald trump becomes president of the united states, we will take the fight to the enemy, we will destroy isis at its source and we will defeat radical islamic terrorism wherever it emerges.” after the speech, pence got a change of clothes and delivered towels to damp reporters on the back of his plane. he spoke with trump by phone after the rally, he said. “six hundred and fifty people standing in the pouring rain,” pence said. “i told him, we’re going to win virginia.”      at 'soggy' pence speech, insults rain down      
__label__0 hillary clinton and her allies extended their financial lead over donald trump in august. the trump campaign raised $41.8 million and spent $29.9 million, ending the month with $50.2 million on hand, according to its report to the federal election commission. together with supporting super pacs and the republican national committee, he had almost $96 million in the bank. story continued below the clinton campaign, the priorities usa super pac and the democratic national committee raised a combined $112.3 million and started september with $121.4 million stockpiled. great america pac and make america number 1, two super pacs supporting trump, raised $3.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively.      trump trailed clinton with $50 million in cash in august      
__label__0 when donald trump took his campaign to high point, north carolina, tuesday, his topics ranged broadly from trade to immigration to terrorism. in other words, none of the hot-button issues that are currently roiling the political landscape in the battleground state that’s looking increasingly essential to his hopes of winning. unlike the presidential contest in nearly every other swing state, north carolina’s is framed this year by two local battles overshadowing almost everything else. story continued below there is house bill 2 — the so-called bathroom bill which has energized young liberals and older conservatives in what’s viewed by many as a battle for the soul of the state. then there is the furor over voting rights, which has provided democrats with a major organizational and energy boost among african-americans. “the intensity that you see on the national level is on steroids in north carolina, because not only do you have this presidential race where they’re both here all the time, you also have a highly-charged governor’s race and senate race with the issues of hb2 and voting rights litigation all rolled up into one,” explained bruce thompson, a raleigh attorney and a longtime, high-profile hillary clinton supporter in the state. “there cannot be another state that has that kind of intensity. it comes up in every conversation. it’s not just the insiders talking about it. it comes up on the sidelines of my daughter’s field hockey games." the two issues form a unique backdrop in a place that suddenly occupies a pivotal role on a hardening electoral map. top clinton aides can’t envision a scenario in which trump loses north carolina but wins the white house. in a memo circulated to donors on monday evening, clinton campaign manager robby mook framed the state’s 15 electoral votes as something close to a must-win for trump. the trump campaign is acting accordingly, with three straight weeks featuring visits to the state from the gop nominee, including his rally tuesday. his allies are hoping the polarizing politics surrounding hb2 and roughly 35 legal showdowns in raleigh this month about voting rights will rally conservatives to his side, putting a gop-leaning state squarely in his column, and stamping out democrats' southern advances in one of clinton’s most frequently visited states. democrats believe the local fireworks provide clinton with an unprecedented chance to juice up enthusiasm among young voters, college-age whites and african-americans — the groups she’s relying on to capture the state. the contentious governor’s race has set the tone, with gop gov. pat mccrory and democratic attorney general roy cooper locked in a contest that’s been so defined by mccrory’s signing of hb2 that democrats have mulled how to saddle trump with the governor’s baggage — a twist on the mechanics of the presidential race in other swing states, where democrats have framed trump as drag on down-ballot candidates. “it may be that what’s keeping north carolina in play is that hillary could be getting cooper’s coattails,” said one veteran democratic operative in the state. the trump campaign did not respond to several requests for comment. the “bathroom bill” issue — which is controversial largely because of its provision that individuals may only use government-funded restrooms corresponding to their gender at birth — has become a defining one for clinton, whose campaign has made a habit of seizing on local controversies in whichever state she’s visiting since the early days of her primary. north carolina has seen businesses and some local entertainment staples flee since the bill’s passage in march, with few departures as politically stinging as the atlantic coast conference’s decision to pull its college football championship game from charlotte or the ncaa's move to ax seven in-state events — including men’s basketball tournament games. wired magazine this week estimated that the bill had cost north carolina nearly $400 million already. "they are huge things that are happening within the state and i think not only is it going to help us,” added clinton’s states director, marlon marshall. “it’s going to help democrats up and down the ticket.” according to an elon university poll released tuesday, 60 percent of likely voters said north carolina’s national reputation is worse as a result of the passage of hb2. clinton’s in-state forces have used the headlines to highlight what they say is republican-led intolerance that has led to economic harm — a case that’s animated the highly educated white voters in the research triangle area who could carry her to victory. speaking last week in greensboro, where some of the basketball games would usually be played, clinton hammered the message home: “look at what’s happening with the ncaa and the acc,” she said. “this is where bigotry leads, and we can’t afford it." the democratic nominee has also weighed in on the voting rights fight that’s been raging since the state implemented rules eliminating same-day registration and requiring an id in 2013, calling such regulations “a blast from the jim crow past” in early september as she campaigned in charlotte. clinton’s in-state team has four lawyers working on staff to bolster her voter protection program, and democratic attorneys there have been engaged in this fall’s fight since 2014. but the dispute returned to the forefront earlier this month after a series of legal rulings about the state’s voting laws — including one from the supreme court that restored one-stop early voting — pushed the onus onto the state’s counties to construct plans for approval by the republican-led state board of elections. democrats then piled lawyers in to work with the local proposals, guaranteeing they had legal representation in each of the more than 30 counties where there was a fight over the plan. ensuring that voters can take advantage of one-stop early voting could help clinton enormously with the state’s large population of rural african-americans who are not registered voters. and it gave the clinton campaign a chance to rally black voters in the cities around the idea that the restrictions were racially motivated in the first place. “there will be more early voting in north carolina than there was in 2012,” explained marshall, making the case that the very presence of more early voting will be a motivator. “that’s a way to energize our base, and get them to show up to the polls." trump, for his part, has also drilled down on north carolina. the attention has paid off: he’s within 1 percentage point of clinton according to the politico battleground states polling average. according to the new elon poll, when including voters leaning toward one of the candidates, trump and clinton were deadlocked at 45 percent, with libertarian gary johnson pulling 7 percent of the vote. unlike clinton, trump's focus in north carolina has been on an anti-trade deal message that especially resonates among older, white working class voters who have lost jobs in industries like textiles. "hillary clinton supported nafta, she supported china's entrance into the world trade organization, and she supported the job-killing deal with south korea that she helped to push through," he said at his high point rally.      trump puts a boiling battleground in play      
__label__0 their distaste for donald trump was no secret. but they saw no point in publicizing it. from miami to houston, crawford to kennebunkport, members of the republican party’s first family remained quiet for months, avoiding cameras and questions about presidential politics and focusing their few fundraiser appearances on assisting the gop candidates who would be forced to share the november ballot with a nominee they detest. story continued below but given the bush clan’s proximity to public life, and their progeny’s desire to one day return the family to power, it was only a matter of time before they could hold their tongues no longer. over a 24-hour span that began with jeb bush's surprising and sardonic cameo in sunday's emmy awards broadcast and monday night’s reports that his father, former president george h.w. bush, had told a family friend privately that he intended to support hillary clinton, the bushes returned to the headlines, and are giving trump just the establishment foil he so capably exploits. "he probably loves that former president bush isn't backing him because it underlines his whole case against the establishment," one former jeb bush campaign staffer said. "i bet he's highlighting it in his stump speech before long." george w. bush, who is headed to washington this weekend to headline a fundraiser for senate republicans and attend the opening of the national museum of african american history and culture, has shared in private settings for months his fear that he will be “the last republican president.” and while bush family loyalists say they do not know whether he is joking, they are certain he cannot support trump. “when you have a republican nominee who supported john kerry in 2004 and implied that president bush was responsible for 9/11 and has repeated the worst lies of the michael moore liberal democrats, how in the world would the bushes support that?” said one longtime gop operative close to the bush family. george h.w. bush, at 92 years of age, is the freest to disavow allegiance to the party’s nominee. although sources close to the former president indicate he would have preferred his vote remain confidential, he harbors a deep disgust for trump, who mocked and insulted his son throughout the primary and whose life of shameless self-promotion and a coarse approach to politics are an affront to the cultivated gentility and pragmatic, big-tent conservatism he and his sons personify. “forty-one instilled a duty and service mentality in the dna of his boys,” said slater bayliss, an alumnus of jeb bush’s administration in tallahassee and a supporter of his 2016 campaign. “i don’t think jeb ran for president because it was best for him, but thought he could make a difference with a positive, policy-focused agenda. the fact that we would expect a guy who was a republican president to support every future republican presidential candidate is silly, especially when you have one like donald trump.” for george h.w. bush and george w. bush, who has demurred on questions about how he’ll vote in the presidential race and focused on assisting down-ballot republicans, there is also the consideration of the bond they share with the clintons as members of an exclusive presidential fraternity and the disaster relief work they have collaborated on as ex-presidents. “there is a mutual regard that exists, despite their obvious political differences, between the families,” one source close to the bush family said. “and also a mutual disregard, a shared disgust for trump as someone so far outside of that club.” those close to the family also doubt that any of the bush women will privately cast a vote for trump. barbara bush campaigned for jeb in new hampshire and lamented trump’s foul language and desecration of the political norms her family always abided by. laura bush and her daughter jenna bush hager have similarly expressed worries about trump’s effect on the political discourse and pleaded the fifth when asked whether they’d be voting for trump. jeb bush, who prosecuted the case against trump to little avail throughout the primary, has said publicly that he doesn’t plan to cast a ballot for trump or clinton — a reasonable position for someone who may hold out hopes of another presidential run or a position in a gop administration down the road, should trump lose in november and allow the party to reset itself for 2020. “i don’t know if it’s part of his thinking or not, but it would be a tough sell to the party to accept him if he’s on the record as having cast a vote for a democratic nominee.” interestingly enough, jeb bush’s son george p. bush is the only family member publicly backing trump. after watching the gop nominee disparage, dismiss and eventually defeat his father, the texas land commissioner, a telegenic latino who has made no secret of his own ambitions for higher office, fell in line behind the party’s nominee, even though he acknowledged it being a “bitter pill to swallow.” “donald trump’s candidacy has divided republican families around the country, and it sounds like this one’s no different,” said one republican bundler who is close to the bush family. the elder bush’s admission that he plans to vote for clinton occurred during a board meeting for the former president’s thousand points of light foundation. kathleen hartington kennedy townsend, the former maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late robert f. kennedy, asked bush about his choice during a receiving line and got a frank answer — which she then posted to her facebook page, prompting news reports monday and tuesday, confirming that bush indeed plans to vote for clinton. several sources close to the former president expressed frustration tuesday with the notion that townsend would publicize what she heard while visiting a 92-year-old man’s living room, calling it a breach of privacy. but the former president himself issued no statement denying the reports of what he said. even before news of bush’s backing, clinton’s campaign was running a television ad highlighting a number of republicans criticizing trump. and she has already won endorsements from many republicans who worked in one or both bush administrations. but just as early forecasts of a possible bush-clinton matchup were met with frustration and fatigue in the run-up to this year’s campaign cycle, confirmation this week of some sort of alliance between the families may only serve to harden the electorate’s obvious antipathy to dynastic, establishment politics. “the reality is, if all of this meant something, donald trump would not be the nominee,” said bruce haynes, a gop consultant in washington. “in raleigh and des moines, people don’t give a damn about what the bushes say or do. if anything, they see the establishment politicians closing ranks around clinton and are more emboldened to do the opposite.”      the bush family’s lament      
__label__0 democrats have some advice for hillary clinton at her first presidential debate: let trump be trump. donald trump’s more tightly scripted campaign of late could backfire on him when he squares off against clinton on monday in hempstead, new york, democrats believe. he won’t be able to rely on the teleprompter he’s been using of late, they say, and trump’s only recent extended interview with the washington post showed that, left to his own devices, he’s apt to stumble back into controversy on issues like barack obama’s birthplace. story continued below “he’s going to say some cockamamie stuff,” said democratic senatorial campaign committee chairman jon tester (d-mont.). “give him the rope.” indeed, the best strategy for clinton, lawmakers advised, is to let trump do most of the talking. “inevitably, he’s going to say enough dumb things to dominate the headlines,” said sen. chris murphy (d-conn.). “he’s gonna make mistakes; the question is, how big are the mistakes? and i’m certain there are things she can do that would cause his mistakes to be bigger.” clinton will have to parry when trump comes directly at her, but a more restrained rope-a-dope strategy is preferable to an aggressive posture right out of the gate, democratic senators said. trump showed in the republican debates that he’s best as a counter-puncher, leveling spontaneous one-liners at his attackers that left them reeling. in one debate alone, trump dubbed sen. marco rubio a “choke artist” and sen. ted cruz a “basket case.” rubio notoriously jumped in the sandbox but lacked trump’s talent — if you want to call it that — for making his zingers stick. those moments should be instructive to clinton, democrats say, and serve as a warning that she should not rush into a war of words with the pioneer of put-downs. “she has to be unafraid,” said senate minority leader harry reid of nevada. “he’s a bully; he can’t help himself. i don’t know how he’s going to use a teleprompter in a debate situation. and he can’t control himself. his attention span is nonexistent.” yet implicit in reid’s comments is what is expected of trump by democrats: very little. and low expectations could be damaging on a debate night that will set the tone for a six-week sprint toward election day. though trump has been less bombastic over the past month, he’s still making headlines on a daily basis, whether by suggesting that clinton’s secret service detail be disarmed or taking credit for predicting recent terrorist attacks in new york. given the freewheeling nature of presidential debates, democrats hope voters will see the vintage trump that’s been partly concealed in recent weeks. “expectations have been exceptionally low for trump. i think that’s why in large part he has gotten away with it,” said sen. bill nelson (d-fla.). “if 150 million people are suddenly glued to their tv sets … they are going to be expecting to see the conduct of who they would want in a future president.” “he’ll do it himself,” said sen. claire mccaskill (d-mo.). “there’s never been a time where he’s talked for longer than 30 seconds where he’s managed to say anything. he just says nothing. he’ll say the same empty phrases over and over again, and i think it will become obvious after an hour and a half.” the debate performances of clinton and trump are the subject of much chatter among democrats on capitol hill, who have watched the race tighten after a summer surge by clinton. when clinton last visited with senate democrats in july, she remarked to the room that she has gotten more advice on debates than any other topic. “everybody in the room laughed, because most of us had given her advice on what to do,” recounted senate minority whip dick durbin (d-ill.). there’s no constituency that will benefit more from a strong clinton performance than democrats desperately trying to take back the senate this fall. they probably need a healthy clinton victory to flip a minimum of four seats needed to recapture the chamber. and clinton needs a strong debate performance to reassert the clear upper hand in the race. “of course it’s important; she’s the head of the ticket. the better she does, [the better] we do,” reid said. “she’s been a successful debater in the race we had with obama. and she’s been good in the primaries with [sen. bernie sanders] screaming and yelling at her all the time.” democrats are counting on clinton to not just wait for trump to stumble; she also has to make an affirmative case to undecided voters, they say. that means contrasting her detailed plans for health care, the minimum wage and immigration with trump’s more broad-brush stands on many issues. “i don’t think that the question is about attacking trump at this point. it’s about pointing out her vision for the country,” said sen. jeanne shaheen (d-n.h.). “people vote not only on who they oppose, but they want to vote for something.” trump bragged on fox news this week that he has the “strongest” temperament. but democrats are betting the 90-minute showdown will reveal the opposite. “it’s important for people to see this side of him that is very much unpresidential and out of control,” said sen. martin heinrich (d-n.m.). “it’s temperament, as much as anything. people want to trust that their president … is in control.”      democrats' debate advice to clinton: let trump screw up      
__label__0 that donald trump’s campaign has had more returns from the dead than a soap opera villain is hardly a novel observation. what is noteworthy is the manner in which he’s bounced back. time and again, trump has survived what only a few years ago would have been considered career-ending gaffes—from calling women “pigs,” to boasting about his sexual prowess, to repeatedly insulting war heroes, to offending mexicans during his off-the-cuff announcement speech, to misspelling basic vocabulary words like “lightweight” and “honor” on his twitter feed. this is a man, after all, who forged his political identity by questioning loudly, without any real evidence, on multiple occasions, and in defiance of every rule of politics, the place of president obama’s birth. and yet here he stands—one or two battleground states away from the white house. this defies all the rules of public life as we’ve come to understand them. for decades, a single spontaneous outburst (john kerry’s “i was for it before i was against it”), a pompous proclamation (whatever al gore intended to say about his role in the internet), a cuckoo pronouncement (george romney’s claim to have been “brainwashed” about the vietnam war), or even an embarrassing misspelling (dan quayle’s infamous attempt to correctly write the word “potato” on a blackboard), caused irreparable, often campaign-ending damage. trump has done all these things—some of them multiple times in the same day. the gaffe hasn’t destroyed trump; it’s made him stronger. the reasons for this are instructive, and they will change the way politics is practiced forever. story continued below at one level, trump’s survival, so far, is less a testament to his shrewdness—though it is a disservice to claim he hasn’t been shrewd—than it is to washington’s studied cowardice. trump is not only making gaffes, he’s brashly owning them, daring the political gods to smite him in what has become an epic rebuke to the dull, predictable, cautious political culture that everyone outside the beltway has learned to recognize and abhor. in terror of the gaffe, candidates have increasingly immersed their true selves behind carefully vetted talking points, anodyne scripts, and cynical consultants, all with the primary purpose of suffocating in its cradle anything approaching a cavalier statement, never mind a surprising or provocative thought. the culmination of this effort is before us: the enthusiasm-starved campaign of hillary clinton, who over her decades in politics has perfected the talent of making even the most cutting-edge idea immediately sound like a cliche. set against this apotheosis of safe, gaffe-free politics, millions have delightedly embraced a man who seems to recognize their appetite for something recognizably real, even if it’s vulgar and offensive. his gaffes aren’t a sideshow: they’re integral to his pitch. for this cohort, a vote for trump is a vote to make the safe, protected, consultant-scripted lives of everyone in d.c. miserable every single day, because they’ve earned it. the larger explanation for the trump phenomenon is even more unsettling for washington’s political class, especially the media. they have lost their power. only a decade or two ago, the media world was confined to a group of people in d.c. and new york—a group that largely knew each other, mingled in the same places, vacationed in the same locales. the most influential members of the group routinely defined what constituted a gaffe, others echoed that view, and it became the conventional wisdom for the rest of america. in the age of the internet, with bloggers spread out across the nation, and multiple platforms across the political spectrum, that’s no longer possible. the growing divergence between these “insiders” and the new “outsiders” has played to trump’s benefit, every single time he made what was once conceived as a “game-changing” error. the first test of this new dynamic arrived on trump day one, when the candidate tossed aside a prepared announcement speech that would have made him sound, well, normal, in favor of a stream-of-consciousness ramble that began with an anecdote about candidates “sweating like dogs,” who were somehow incapable of beating isis to claiming that mexico, in some diabolical frenzy, was shipping rapists and ax murderers to america by the dozens. commenting that “the u.s. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems,” he quickly trained his ire on the influx of illegal immigrants across the mexican border. he claimed that mexico, presumably the government of mexico, was “sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. they're bringing drugs. they're bringing crime. they're rapists. and some, i assume, are good people.” most candidates, of course, know as a general rule that it’s rarely a good idea to include the name of an ethnic group and the word “rapists” in the same sentence. trump either didn’t know this rule, didn’t appreciate what he was saying in the midst of a full ramble, or didn’t care. the “insider” media went to work, claiming that trump had insulted not only all mexicans, but all immigrants. (this was an exaggeration.) boycotts ensued. trump lost his deals with macy’s and nbc. the “outsider” view was very different. time and again, republican voters have told their political leaders that illegal immigration was a major concern. the issue led to a rare uprising against george w. bush during his second term when he pushed what many of his base considered “amnesty,” almost derailed john mccain’s presidential campaign in 2008, and haunted marco rubio throughout 2016. but most gop leaders, believing “comprehensive immigration reform” was the key to attracting hispanic voters, didn’t get it. they ignored their core voters on the issue. trump sounded as perplexed and angry as they were. what he said wasn’t a gaffe, not to them. it showed he was listening—a skill washington lost many election cycles ago. this pattern has repeated itself ever since. if you were a campaign consultant looking to the future, it would be worth studying trump’s “gaffes”—not to avoid them, but to figure out just why they work so well. if you list them and pick them apart, you could start to see them as a playbook for a new kind of anti-washington politics, one in which the candidate speaks right past the old “insider” audience of media and beltway elites, and delivers an outsider electorate exactly what it had been waiting to hear. here’s how it works, in three examples: 1. ben carson the “psychopath” on the campaign trial, trump cites ben carson’s acclaimed memoir, which discusses carson’s violent temper during his youth. (carson is currently threatening trump’s front-runner status in polls.) “it's in the book that he's got a pathological temper," trump tells an interviewer. "that's a big problem because you don't cure that ... as an example: child molesting. you don't cure these people. you don't cure a child molester. there's no cure for it. pathological, there's no cure for that." insider: trump destroys himself and permanently alienates carson and his supporters by comparing carson to a child molester. (which trump, arguably, didn’t exactly do.) outsider: trump is a fighter, willing to use carson’s own words directly against him. the media does this to politicians all the time. what’s the big deal? outcome: trump overtakes carson in polls. carson ultimately forgives trump, endorses him for president and serves as a surrogate for him—except when carson needs to find his luggage. trump win 2. mccain the “captured” war hero at an iowa event in june 2015, trump outrageously questions john mccain’s war hero status (after mccain went after trump supporters as “crazies.”) “he’s not a war hero,” said trump, before immediately reversing himself. “he was a war hero because he was captured. i like people who weren’t captured.” insider view: we all know john mccain—great guy, war hero, very quotable. who in their right mind would take on a pow who endured torture for more than five years in his nation’s service, especially a guy who never served in uniform himself? proof positive that trump’s nuts. outsider view: trump probably went too far on this, but many of us don’t like amnesty-supporting mccain all that much anyway. besides, mccain was taking cracks at trump. why shouldn’t he respond? outcome: eventually, after much resistance, trump quasi-apologizes by claiming he didn’t say what he obviously meant to say. mccain endorses trump for the presidency. trump win 3. bush the warmonger fresh off of his victory in new hampshire, trump heads to south carolina, the alleged bush “firewall” where his brother, george w. bush, is going to campaign for his brother jeb. during a televised debate in the veteran-thick state, trump says w. “lied” about weapons of mass destruction in iraq in order to go to war: “they said there were weapons of mass destruction, there were none. and they knew there were none.” he is greeted with boos from the audience. insiders: south carolina veterans will not forgive trump for insulting the bushes or repeating the left’s claims that bush lied the country into war. we’ve been assured all year long by bush campaign people that jeb was going to win in south carolina, a state with nostalgic love for the bushes. trump made a huge miscalculation with his latest outburst. outsiders: the bushes are yesterday’s news. and, come to think of it, why did we go into iraq? outcome: trump wins the south carolina primary by about 10 points. bush comes in fourth and drops out of the race. trump win care to continue? i didn’t think so. and i still haven’t gotten to how trump wondered aloud whether ted cruz’s dad may have been in or near the grassy knoll the day of the kennedy assassination—nor to trump’s brilliant response when called on his epic troll: “they didn’t deny it.” by the time trump gaffed his way to the republican nomination, furious and frustrated media outlets had been grappling for months with how to hold him to account, as they’ve managed with other candidates in the past. a journalist asked trump to identify the “five sources” that he claimed had told him mexico was deliberately sending criminals across our border. the brilliance, of course, was in the number. not one. not two. but five people. who would make up a number like that? in any event, trump refused to disclose their names. were they business colleagues? informants from the mexican government? did all of them have the last name trump? we’re left to wonder. most people didn’t seem to care. he’s probably making it up, they think, but whatever. multiple web pages and assorted news articles have devoted themselves to chronicling trump’s habit of making an outrageous statement, and then later denying such statement was ever made. examples abound: that marco rubio was the personal senator for mark zuckerberg, that the pro-free-market trump had supported health care mandates, that he ever told supporters to “knock the crap” out of protesters, after some did just that. trump’s infuriating ability to wiggle out of all sorts of statements has left fact-checkers—who have labeled him among the biggest fibbers in recent political history—in a state of distress. after all, a decades-long pattern of denying clear and unequivocal statements is the kind of audacity usually reserved for the clintons. which, come to think of it, may be why trump’s dalliances with deception hasn’t seem to outrage people who don’t work in the media. the latest effort is the instant fact check—in which cable news channels, such as cnn, note in real-time whether a candidate is making a truthful claim, as in “trump (falsely) claims x.” one doesn’t get the impression that these “instant” fact-checks have been applied quite so forcefully to hillary clinton. and this, too, seems to have blown up in their collective faces, signaling to outsiders that the mainstream media, as they suspected, is just in the tank for the democrats. in the years-long battle between trump and his javert-like media interlocutors, nothing has led to more perfectly justified hysteria than his pirouette over the obama birther business. as far as conspiracy theories go, the rock-solid contention that barack obama was not born in the united states was always of the nonsensical variety. after all, even if he had been born someplace else, no fault of his own, the president still would have been born to an american citizen, his mother. that alone would qualify him for the presidency, just as much as it does cruz, or mccain, or george romney (all of whom were not born in the u.s.) but the dark and daffy corners of the so-called alt-right is no place for logic. last week, as he began passing clinton in many polls, trump seemed to have fallen prey to the “birther” gaffe again by refusing to say whether he believed the president was born in the united states. media outlets could not believe their luck—trump was stepping into it again. or was he? at a news conference devoted to promoting his new d.c. hotel, trump finally announced his (latest) position: “hillary clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. i finished it. president barack obama was born in the united states, period.” this was trump at his most fiendish. not only had he repudiated his own long history as a “birther,” not only had he lured the national news media into giving wall-to-wall coverage of a hotel opening, he blamed his opponent for the whole thing. no other activity in recent political history engendered as much of an outcry from the insider media, with the possible exception of sarah palin’s nomination for the vice presidency of the united states. to the insiders, no single moment in the campaign was more appalling, or revealing of trump’s singular mendacity. his pirouette not only made fools of the press by getting them to cover an infomercial disguised as a news conference, it was a brazen effort to shift blame for a controversy that trump did more than any other prominent american to promote. surely, the press assumed, the public would see this? they saw it, all right—but not in the same way. to an outsider, a savvy businessman had just engineered a brilliant ad for his latest venture, while efficiently backing away from a controversy he probably didn’t take all that seriously anyway. and as he did it, he left the media caught just a bit in a trap of its own. as they rushed to attack trump on his latest “lie,” most outlets conveniently omitted to mention that in fact there was some truth in trump’s contention. the clinton campaign may not have “started” the birther controversy. but it was circulated by her supporters, and clinton world definitely had a hand in it. according to a former editor with the mcclatchy news service, one of clinton’s closest confidants, sidney blumenthal, personally spread the “birther” story himself. (blumenthal flatly calls this “false,” leaving the story in “his word against mine” territory.) what an unbiased observer might conclude from all of this is that many mainstream media outlets, so blinded in their distaste for trump and so determined to unmask him as an unprecedented liar, have now compromised themselves in the process. which is one more lesson from the trump playbook: if you make enough gaffes, pretty soon your crazed critics will start making gaffes of their own.      trump’s guide to winning through gaffes      
__label__0 even as donald trump and his allies ramped up their fundraising and political infrastructure in august, their combined monthly fundraising haul lagged $42 million behind that of hillary clinton’s forces, according to a politico analysis of reports filed tuesday with the federal election commission. the trump campaign, two supportive super pacs and the republican national committee pulled in a combined $70 million, relying largely on small donors, during the tumultuous month of august, when his campaign shook up its leadership in an attempt to reboot after a chaotic nominating convention in july. story continued below by contrast, the clinton campaign, an allied super pac and the democratic national committee, leaning heavily on major donors, raised a total of $112 million in august, as her campaign rode a strong bounce from its tightly choreographed, star-studded convention. trump’s forces entered september with almost $96 million in the bank, while clinton’s started the month with $121.4 million, according to politico’s analysis. the analysis does not include fundraising tallies for the joint fundraising committees the rival candidates created with their respective parties, nor does it include the fundraising hauls from some supportive super pacs. all of those committees disclose their finances on a quarterly basis, meaning they won’t be required to file detailed financial reports until oct. 15. but the analysis provides revealing hints about the contrasting strategies employed by the presidential candidates and their allies. the joint fundraising committee that trump created with the rnc appears to be sitting on a significant sum of cash — perhaps as much as $47 million at the end of last month — while distributing only $12 million to the rnc itself and $20 million to trump’s campaign. that transfer to trump accounted for nearly half his august total — the first time he’s received such a large portion of his cash that way. clinton, on the other hand, received $31.4 million from her own joint fundraising vehicle, and the democratic national committee received $12 million. an additional $12 million appear to have gone to state parties but been rerouted to the dnc, repeating a pattern from previous months. (the dnc also transferred out some $14 million to various state parties in august.) trump’s campaign, which had largely eschewed spending on the trappings of political tactics, showed early signs of implementing a more conventional operation under its new leadership. it spent serious money — $5.3 million — on paid media in august, most of which went through rick reed media, though $718,000 went through jamestown associates, the firm of his then-new senior communications adviser jason miller. that was dwarfed by the $32.7 million that clinton paid her media buyer, gmmb, in august. trump spent almost $1 million on field consultants, up from $432,000 in july. and his campaign’s staff grew to 140 people, with a total payroll of $643,000, up from $392,000 for 84 people in july. but that still trailed clinton’s 789-person, $3.3 million payroll. trump more than doubled his spending on field consulting in august to $973,000. the campaign also paid for polling, something it had been reluctant to do, directing $128,500 to the firm of kellyanne conway, who took over as campaign manager late in the month. and it spent $250,000 on data services provided by cambridge analytica, a firm owned largely by the influential mercer family, which played a pivotal role in trump’s campaign shakeup and is spearheading one of the super pacs backing the campaign. still, the campaign continued devoting serious cash to bankroll the former reality tv star’s traveling show: $2 million went for rally-related expenses including facility rentals, audio-visual services, and event staging and consulting. then, of course, there was the spending on trump branding, which included $420,00 on hats and $1.7 million on t-shirts and other merchandise. and the campaign spent $547,000 on services provided by trump’s own companies, including $170,000 for rent at trump tower and $319,000 on tag air inc. by contrast, trump spent only $80,000 on strategy consulting, with the firm of fired campaign manager corey lewandowski receiving $20,000 of that. and the campaign’s largest expense continued to be online advertising and fundraising payments to the austin-based digital firm of trump’s digital director brad parscale, who is running the campaign’s online fundraising and advertising efforts, despite having no prior political experience. his firm reaped $11.1 million in august — up nearly $3 million from july and good for a third of all the campaign’s spending. although the online fundraising effort overseen by parscale helped produce an impressive small-dollar haul in which 65 percent of the campaign’s contributions came in amounts of less than $200, the payments to giles-parscale suggest the campaign has spent heavily on list rentals, email solicitations and online advertising to round up those small contributions. the percentage of cash that clinton raised from small donors was half of trump’s. about 31 percent of her cash came in checks of less than $200, which actually marked a slight improvement over her average across the cycle. clinton and running mate tim kaine focused in august on big-dollar fundraisers in exclusive summer destinations. likewise, the main super pac supporting clinton, priorities usa, drew more than half of its $23.4 million august haul from its top five donors: slim-fast founder daniel abraham and newsweb chairman fred eychaner ($3 million each), billionaire financier george soros ($2.5 million), investor donald sussman and laurene powell jobs’ emerson collective (both with $2 million). trump received some good news this week about the fundraising of his own high-dollar super pacs. las vegas casino mogul sheldon adelson, who had been sitting out the cycle so far, and his wife, miriam, reportedly committed $5 million to a pro-trump super pac effort, but the group to which he has pledged the cash hasn’t launched the effort and it won’t disclose its finances until next month. the other super pacs supporting trump have continued to lag in fundraising. make america number 1, the pro-trump super pac run by the mercer family, received $1 million from cherna moskowitz, a miami philanthropist, and $50,000 from erik prince, who founded the defense contractor blackwater. but it didn’t receive any other big checks and didn’t get a dime in august from the mercer family, which had donated $2 million to the pac in july. another pro-trump super pac, great america pac, appears to have the campaign’s blessing after eric trump, the candidate’s son, attended one of its events. but it raised only $3.6 million in august, including $250,000 from rhs investments, a texas company that appears to be tied to banking executive robert h. seale, and $200,000 from martin harmon of rocklin, calif. the committee to restore america’s greatness and rebuilding america now — other pro-trump super pacs — won’t disclose their financials until next month because they report on a quarterly cycle. the same goes for pro-clinton groups american bridge and correct the record.      trump forces lagged clinton in august money race      
__label__0 democrats are starting to show cracks in their support for legislation that would allow families of 9/11 victims to sue saudi arabia — suggesting white house opposition to the bill may be resonating with lawmakers preparing for the first veto override vote of barack obama’s presidency. but to sustain his expected veto, obama will need to persuade 34 senators to change course and oppose the bill — a very difficult task. the legislation sailed through both chambers with no opposition. and the white house now has scant time to make its case to capitol hill, with a veto override vote in the senate expected this month. story continued below still, there are glimmers of hope for the administration. key lawmakers are now making it clear they remain undecided on overriding obama’s presumed veto — a notable departure from the overwhelming show of support behind the legislation when it unanimously passed both chambers earlier this year. california sen. dianne feinstein, the top democrat on the intelligence committee, indicated this week that she was rethinking her support for the saudi arabia legislation amid renewed arguments against the measure from the obama administration. “i do have some second thoughts with respect to that,” feinstein said. “i think it could bring on a whole host of unintended consequences.” house minority whip steny hoyer of maryland, the no. 2 house democrat, said tuesday that “this is not a bill without complex ramifications” and he wanted to see obama’s formal veto and his rationale for opposing the legislation before making up his mind on overriding it. “i think it would be incorrect for any member to think this is a very simple issue, that it may not have ramifications for the united states in other venues around the world,” hoyer said. “having said that, i will reiterate, i share and there is great sympathy among the senate, the house, bipartisan, to assure that the american families who have suffered great grief and loss have an avenue to address their grievances.” but their public trepidation is going up against relentless lobbying from family members of the sept. 11 victims, who have proved to be a powerful force. when republican sens. bob corker of tennessee and lindsey graham of south carolina began expressing their qualms with the legislation and suggesting that a veto override should be held off until the end of the year, the families fired back, saying the republicans are asking “far more than the families and survivors should ever be asked to accept.” that ferocious push continued into tuesday, as senate majority whip john cornyn (r-texas) met privately with 9/11 families in his office and sen. richard blumenthal (d-conn.) held a news conference outside the capitol with victims of the terrorist attacks. another enemy working against the white house is simple: time. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) said tuesday he plans to hold the override vote before senators leave washington to campaign, dramatically cutting down the time the white house has to coax enough senators to sustain obama’s expected rejection of the 9/11 legislation. mcconnell said he assumed the veto will be overridden. the president has yet to formally issue a veto, but he is required to do so by friday. because the legislation originated from the senate, that chamber will move first on an override. speaking to reporters in new york, where obama was attending the u.n. general assembly, white house press secretary josh earnest acknowledged that the administration faces a “steep hill” in addressing their own concerns about the 9/11 bill. yet earnest suggested that more lawmakers are on their side than public comments would indicate. “as we’ve made this case, members of congress in both parties have indicated that they are open to the concerns that we’ve expressed. in many cases, they share them,” earnest said. “and the real question for members of congress will be whether or not they’re prepared to cast a vote that is consistent with the views and feelings that they expressed in private.” the white house has repeatedly listed several concerns with the measure, including its view that the 9/11 bill could open up u.s. officials to legal retaliation in foreign courts. earnest has also argued that the legislation could lead to different judges in different courtrooms coming up with varying terror designations about the same country. illinois sen. dick durbin, the second-ranking democrat who sits on the judiciary committee, said he still had not decided whether he would support overriding obama’s presumed veto. “i certainly agree with the premise” of the bill, durbin said. but “some colleagues, in this case graham and corker have raised questions about whether or not there ought to be some modifications. i’ve talked with sen. [chuck] schumer, there already have been modifications made.” the legislation, formally known as the justice against sponsors of terrorism act, amends the foreign sovereign immunity act to prevent countries involved in terrorist attacks on u.s. soil from invoking sovereign immunity, a legal principle that shields foreign nations from legal action. that would pave the way for 9/11 families to pursue lawsuits related to the attacks. it’s not a new measure in capitol hill; it cleared the senate last congress and then resurfaced in the chamber earlier this year. this time, proponents of the legislation note that changes have already been made to the legislation to accommodate concerns from the obama administration, and in their view, there’s little room left for a compromise. still, other influential democrats show signs of taking pause. “i certainly don’t want to shield those who are supporting terrorism,” said maryland sen. ben cardin, the top democrat on the foreign relations committee. “on the other hand, i understand the importance of sovereign immunity as it relates to international activities. so i’d like to understand the president’s concerns, whether there are alternative ways to handle this before i make a judgment.” late tuesday, graham said he has been in touch with the white house and saudi officials but said he was pessimistic on any prospects to come up with revisions to satisfy both the victims’ families, as well as ease the obama administration’s diplomatic concerns. “it’s either/or politics now,” graham said. “you’re either for 9/11 families or you’re for saudi arabia. it shouldn’t be that way.” other key republicans also stressed they were also undecided. “i’m willing to hear [the white house’s] concerns,” said sen. jeff flake (r-ariz.), a member of the judiciary committee, which crafted the bill. the two top senators on the judiciary committee — chairman chuck grassley (r-iowa) and ranking member patrick leahy of vermont — both said they firmly backed the legislation, which emerged from their committee earlier this year before passing the full senate in may. “it should be 100-0, but i don’t expect that it will be,” grassley said of a vote to override a veto of the 9/11 bill. “if people don’t want to override the veto, they should’ve expressed their opposition earlier.” sarah wheaton contributed to this report.      democrats waver on override for 9/11 bill      
__label__0 protests erupted overnight tuesday into wednesday in charlotte, north carolina, after a police officer shot and killed an african-american man while looking for another person who had an outstanding warrant. according to local reports, police officers saw keith lamont scott getting out of his car while holding a gun. the charlotte-mecklenburg police department said scott posed an imminent danger to officers, and officer brentley vinson, who is also african-american, shot the man. story continued below "as is standard procedure with any officer involved shooting, officer vinson has been placed on paid administrative leave," the police department said in a statement tuesday night. protesters gathered near the scene of the shooting, an area near the campus of the university of north carolina at charlotte. footage from the protests showed people shouting “black lives matter,” “hands up, don’t shoot” and “no justice, no peace.” a reporter with a local nbc affiliate posted a video of a journalist injured by a rock hurled in her direction, as the police department deployed its civil emergency unit. at 10:46 p.m., the department’s official twitter account said that an officer “sustained injuries in an attempt to deescalate agitators during demonstration.” approximately 12 officers were injured during the protests, according to a later tweet from the department early wednesday morning. the latest incident comes on the heels of another police-involved shooting in tulsa, oklahoma, last friday that claimed the life of terence crutcher, an unarmed 40-year-old man.      12 police officers injured during north carolina protests      
__label__0 as opponents of the trans-pacific partnership trade agreement look to prevent congress from voting on the deal in the lame-duck session later this year, they have increasingly focused on one controversial section of the pact to make their case: the investor state dispute settlement system, or isds. isds allows foreign investors to sue host countries over regulations that affect their businesses. the cases are heard outside national courts by ad hoc tribunals that are empowered to award taxpayer-funded compensation. on the right, critics like donald trump claim the tpp would "give up congressional power" and cost america its "economic independence." left-wing critics like bernie sanders are equally dour, claiming the pact "undermines our sovereignty and subverts democratically passed laws including those dealing with labor, health and the environment." trump and sanders overstate the novelty of this part of the tpp. isds has been included in thousands of pacts, including dozens involving tpp countries, most of which allow investors to pick the most favorable rules in a host state's treaty network. tpp didn't create the system, and rejecting it won't end it. but the critics have cause for concern. isds, as currently designed, allows investors to launch billion-dollar claims against governments for sometimes little more than making good on campaign pledges to their citizens. from egypt to el salvador, buzzfeed's chris hamby reports, investors have invoked isds threats to obtain sweetheart settlements from governments. some of those deals have put severe strain on national budgets. "shadow courts," a new book by time magazine's haley edwards, shows how isds threats have strained support for free trade around the world. fixing isds should be a high priority for the next administration. in fact, such a fix would require just a few sentences of legislation to rein in the worst abuses of the system while upholding investor rights. in 1990, now-tpp advocates sen. chuck grassley (r-iowa) and rep. dan glickman (d-kan.) helped enact the administrative dispute resolution act. this legislation allowed would-be legal disputes between american citizens and u.s. government agencies to be routed into binding arbitration. to address constitutionality concerns, a vital safeguard was built into the mix: third parties could appeal to u.s. courts to overturn an arbitration award if broader social interests were at risk. that legislation provided a template for my proposal to fix isds, which i presented at the american political science association meetings earlier this month in philadelphia. it leverages a little-appreciated aspect of the investment rules. unlike weaker areas of international law, isds awards are enforced ultimately in national courts. under current supreme court precedent, u.s. judges are instructed to defer to arbitral decisions. in other words, if a country loses a case in arbitration, it cannot appeal to national judges to overturn that decision because it was wrong or shortsighted. under my proposal, this wouldn’t be the case. i proffer a so-called equitable investment act. just a few sentences long, this would give third parties a new right to petition u.s. courts to vacate arbitration awards that affect broader social interests. here's how it would work in practice: say a french bank sues argentina under a bilateral franco-argentine treaty, alleging that a new argentine administration's signature financial regulation plan cut into profits more than under a previous lighter-touch regime. under the current isds system, the company could sue argentina under the isds system and benefit from the possibility—however remote—that arbitrators would side with it and order cash payment. and under current federal arbitration laws, the bank would enjoy the near certainty that national courts would help enforce the award—with no review of the policy merits of the underlying claim. under the equitable investment act, in contrast, a u.s. court would be empowered to set aside the arbitrators' award if argentine consumer groups showed it would harm their interests in a stable financial system back home. the legislation would presume that the u.s. has jurisdiction to review the award. while innovative, the proposal builds on existing practice. already, u.s. courts can be asked to help attach argentina's u.s. assets in such a dispute with french investors. the reform would simply expand their mandate and move up the timing of their involvement. even if argentine activists never used these rights, the possibility that they could would deter investors from challenging popular public interest policies. my proposal is doable in the first 100 days, even without a shift in the composition of congress. already, both parties have critiqued isds. moreover, in a separate scuffle, a bipartisan coalition is poised to override president obama's veto of a bill shredding the sovereign immunity in u.s. courts of foreign states linked to terrorism. with this standoff, legislators have shown themselves willing to strain diplomatic ties and risk loss of foreign sovereigns' investment in the u.s. in comparison, the relatively modest equitable investment act would incentivize that money to return, as sovereigns facing overreaching isds claims would enjoy new protections for their assets. the impasse over isds points to a bigger problem: we lack a global governance system for investment that is coherent and fair enough to command popular support. hillary clinton has pledged to invent a "new paradigm" on investor-state dispute resolution, and trump advisers have also called for change. but both clinton and trump are short on policy details. in the short term, they should take up this proposal. but in the long term, my stopgap measure will not be enough. new treaty rules are needed to put global governance on a more sustainable footing. among other things, investors will be eager to move toward a system in which treaty outcomes are more certain. as part of a one-two punch with the changes to domestic arbitration law, the next administration should propose a global equitable investment convention and call on other countries to sign up. my convention proposal would separate investor gripes into two tracks, which would better mirror our national laws' balance of property rights and democratic decision-making. first, states that expropriate property will have to compensate investors promptly and fairly. instead of isds legal proceedings that take years to resolve and often deliver only pennies on investors' claims, teams of accountants would work to precisely tally the value of what investors sunk into their projects. states would then get a bill, which they could pay or challenge in a fast-tracked arbitration. alternatively, if a state harmed an investor in less severe ways, arbitrators could still rule on whether and how the government fell short of its obligations. but unlike the current system, arbitrators would produce an advisory decision in six months. this document would not only find faults, but recommend specific reforms governments could make to come into compliance. states would accept or reject the advice, but they would be required to explain their choice and make all of the correspondence public. most important, the convention would fix isds' double standard. instead of foreign investors enjoying rights that domestic investors, unions and environmental groups don't, the pact would level the playing field. just as an investor can now ask a tribunal to determine whether capital controls violate a state's obligations, a union would be able to request a second opinion on collective bargaining rights. an environmental ngo could shine a spotlight on weak carbon emissions plans. and domestic investors could complain about preferential treatment received by wealthy foreign companies. these rulings will allow citizens to name and shame bad governments without compromising sovereignty. this proposal would accomplish what neither side of the tpp debate has promised: a path toward systemic reform of the over 3,000 isds pacts that already exist. countries that joined the convention would spare their investors from being dragged into u.s. courts under the act. for any two countries that joined the convention, their past deals would be automatically superseded—without time-consuming country-by-country negotiations. in a global economy, international and domestic law can check and improve each other. from trade wars to climate change to tax avoidance, we need to ensure that countries don't solve their problems at each other’s expense. international rules have a role to play, and independent adjudicators can be referees when the rules are in doubt. but the dialogue needs to be more dynamic—from arbitrators, to states, to the public, and back—if it's going to lead to better and more legitimate governance. todd tucker is a fellow at the roosevelt institute, where he researches international economic law and politics."      how to fix the most controversial element of trade deals

chanted slogans and held signs reading ‘black lives matter’ and ‘stop killing us.’ the scene was sometimes chaotic and tense, with water bottles and stones chucked at police lines, but many protesters called for peace and implored their fellow demonstrators not to act violently. ‘accountability!’ one man shouted repeatedly at cmpd officers. ‘you don’t get to murder us and get away with it!’ yelled

__label__0 election day is more than a month away, but voters are already casting ballots to pick their next president. voting opened on monday in wisconsin rapids, wisconsin, making the town's voters among the first in the nation to do so. so far, voting is limited to a smattering of counties and municipalities in states that allow local governments to set their own schedules. on friday, however, voters statewide in south dakota and minnesota will be allowed to cast early ballots. and other states are joining soon: new jersey starts early voting on saturday, and vermont plans to start early voting as soon as the ballots are ready. (state rules say no later than saturday.) story continued below in total, 37 states and the district of columbia will allow early voting in 2016. some of those states allow voters to request mail ballots and send them in, while others open physical polling places weeks or even months before the election. in the 2012 presidential election, approximately 30 percent of the votes cast came via mail or early balloting, meaning many voters will weigh in before the candidates have had a chance to make their closing case. typically, democrats lead in early voting, especially in-person early voting, because their voters are not as likely to go out to the polls as republicans, said michael mcdonald, an election expert and associate professor at the university of florida. the gop, however, tends to make up ground through mail in absentee ballots, mcdonald said. here’s when early voting begins in each state. (note, the below dates represent the earliest date that voters statewide can send for a ballot or vote in person without a special exemption.) alabama — there’s no universal early voting in alabama, as voters need a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. alaska — oct. 24. arizona — oct. 12. local counties are still finalizing the locations where voters can vote in-person, but ballots for mail-in voting begin going out on the 12th. arkansas — oct. 24. california — early voting opening dates are set by the county/municipality. oct. 10 is the first day to vote early in los angeles county. colorado — oct. 24. connecticut — there is no early voting in connecticut, as voters need a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. district of columbia — oct. 22 at one judiciary square, oct. 29 for all other locations. delaware — there is no early voting in delaware, as voters need a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. florida — all counties are required to allow voting from oct. 29 to nov. 5. some have the option to start earlier. georgia — oct. 17. voters can sign up for an absentee ballot starting sept. 20. hawaii — oct. 25. idaho — sept. 23. counties must send out absentee ballot requests no later than the 23rd, but are allowed to offer early voting. early voting opening dates are set by the county/municipality. illinois — sept. 29 to nov. 7. starting sept. 29, voters can only cast their ballots at their local election authority or a temporary location, but early voting expands to permanent polling places starting oct. 24. indiana — oct. 12. early voting starts at the local county election board office or another designated location, but with an excuse, voters can cast a ballot by mail. iowa — sept. 29. kansas — oct. 19. counties are allowed to set earlier extended early voting dates. kentucky — there is no early voting in kentucky, unless voters have a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. louisiana — oct. 25 to nov. 1. maine — oct. 9 is the general opening date, but the state allows you to vote as soon as the ballots are printed, and some people have already cast their ballots. maryland — oct. 27 to nov. 3. massachusetts — oct. 24 to nov. 4. michigan — there is no early voting in michigan, as voters require a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. minnesota — sept. 23. mississippi — there is no early voting in mississippi, as voters need a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. missouri — there is no early voting in missouri, as voters need a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. montana — in-person early voting begins as soon as ballots are ready, which is expected to be around oct. 11. nebraska — oct. 3. the counties mail out requests starting on the 3rd, but the first day to vote early in-person is oct. 7. nevada — oct. 22. new hampshire — there is no early voting in new hampshire, unless voters have a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. new jersey — sept. 24. in-person early voting may begin sooner (it starts as soon as ballots are available), but mail-in ballots are sent out beginning on the 24th. new mexico — oct. 11 to nov. 5. voters can apply for an absentee ballot on oct. 11, but starting on the 22nd they can vote early in person. new york — there is no early voting in new york, as voters require a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. north carolina — sept. 9, oct. 20 to nov. 5. absentee ballots have already been sent out, but the formal early voting period does not start until october. north dakota — sept. 29. absentee and mail ballots can be sent out by county officials starting on the 29th, but the exact date might vary from one location to the next. ohio — oct. 12. oklahoma — nov. 3 to nov. 5. oregon — oct. 19. pennsylvania — there is no early voting in pennsylvania, as voters need a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. rhode island — there is no early voting in rhode island, unless voters have a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. south carolina — there is no early voting in south carolina, unless voters have a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. the state does, however, give voters more absentee leeway than many. south dakota — sept. 23. tennessee — oct. 19 to nov. 3. texas — oct. 24 to nov. 4. utah — oct. 25 to nov. 4. virginia — there is no early voting in virginia, unless voters have a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. vermont — sept. 23 to nov. 7. early voting could start before the 23rd, but it will not begin any later than that date. washington — oct. 21. some voters may receive their ballot earlier, but this is the latest counties can mail them out. west virginia — oct. 26 to nov. 5. wisconsin — early voting opening dates are set by the county/municipality. wisconsin rapids began voting sept. 19. wyoming — sept. 23 to nov. 7.      when does early voting start in every state?

capital’s ambition to become a candidate to host the 2024 olympics. raggi, a member of the anti-establishment 5star movement and the first female mayor of rome, argued that hosting the olympics would leave rome more indebted than it is now and that the infrastructure built for the olympics would turn into “cathedrals in the desert” after the event. “it is irresponsible to approve this candidacy,” raggi told reporters in rome wednesday. with rome out of the contest, three cities, paris, los angeles and budapest, remain in the race to host the olympic games eight years from now. during her election campaign, raggi had expressed doubts whether rome, a deeply indebted city which has been struggling with waste management problem for months, should host the sporting event. also on politico hortense goulard also on politico francesco guerrera, jacopo barigazzi and silvia sciorilli borrelli she had stopped short of saying she would withdraw rome’s candidacy if elected mayor, raising hopes among supporters of the project, including prime minister matteo renzi, that she could change her mind the international olympic committee will choose the city that will host the 2024 games in a

__label__0 his wife’s operatives are hunkered down in debate prep, but bill clinton is waging a campaign of his own, trying to clear the name of a foundation that has caused controversy in the 2016 race. the former president views the final glitzy meeting of his clinton global initiative — which he will address on wednesday in an emotional farewell — as his last big opportunity to counter accusations that the philanthropy served as a vehicle for wealthy foreign donors to curry access with his wife’s state department. story continued below between his appearances on stage this week, clinton was still writing the speech; it will be a “personal reflection” on his 15 years at the clinton foundation, according to a person familiar with his thinking. he aims to explain how “cgi helped redefine philanthropy.” he also is expected to make an impassioned argument that the foundation has improved lives around the world — a statement he hopes will serve as a powerful rebuke of the controversy that has turned his post-presidential work into a political obstacle for hillary clinton, adding to the damaging perception that the democratic nominee is untrustworthy. bill clinton is not expected to mention donald trump or even his wife’s campaign, the source said. instead, he will aim for an optimistic tone and tell the audience that “when you appeal to the best in people, you get the best. and when you appeal to the worst in people, you get the worst.” but with 48 days left in this contest — and voters in focus groups still expressing concern about what they view as inside dealing for foundation donors seeking special access — many democrats said they were baffled by the former president’s decision to carry on with the conference at all. trump has seized on the foundation, accusing the clintons of selling access. and on monday, the republican national committee said the foundation’s “continued acceptance of foreign contributions while [hillary clinton] runs for the white house is an unprecedented and unacceptable conflict of interest that undermines her ability to serve.” the foundation in august announced it would no longer accept corporate or foreign contributions if hillary clinton wins the white house and that cgi would come to an end regardless of the election outcome. but even allies worried that this year's conference was an unforced error that served only to cede the spotlight to the wrong clinton just as the democratic nominee needs to promote her own case to voters. “they would have been better off postponing it this year,” said one member of the democratic national committee and a clinton ally. “the foundation has been a negative this year, with concerns about donors seeking influence and access — why shine light on it right before the debate?” one source close to bill clinton said putting it off simply wasn’t an option. "they had no choice,” the ally said. “these things are set up long in advance and usually get good press. they never thought it would be such a problem.” the former president seemed determined to turn it into an opportunity to change the narrative. bill clinton, close allies said, has been furious about what he sees as the “smearing” of his life’s work, the aids relief and the global fight on behalf of women’s rights overshadowed by questions of where the foundation gets its money. and both clintons, sources said, have been frustrated that hillary clinton's brooklyn-based campaign has not done enough to explain the philanthropic work the charity does at home and abroad, or that its mission is moral, not financial. throughout the week, the former president was determined to use what may be his final solo spotlight to regain the moral high ground. "in real life, if somebody tells a lie about you, and i find out it is [a lie], i like you more and them less,” bill clinton told npr earlier this week. “in political life, if they just keep on smearing you — even if it all comes to nothing — people will like you less and won't hold anybody accountable for what they say." sitting down with cnbc in the middle of the day tuesday, he added: “i've learned already in this election, some people were just subject to a presumption of guilt just because they were participating.” hillary clinton’s campaign went on offense too; it highlighted a washington post report that trump used $258,000 of his foundation’s money for his personal legal defense. “today has provided a stark contrast between the potentially illegal activities of the trump foundation and how the clinton foundation is improving millions of lives here in the u.s. and around the world,” said clinton spokesman josh schwerin. “that's a debate we'll have anytime." the showcase gathering, held annually at the sheraton near times square, typically brings together fortune 500 ceos, world leaders, celebrities and nonprofit leaders — a high-wattage assembly that, this year, runs counter to the current populist mood across the country. even the snacks served catered to the limousine liberal set; vegan “energy squares” made of fig, hazelnut and cacao nibs, and multigrain crisps smeared with almond butter and maple syrup, were served between “breakout sessions.” while bono and former victoria’s secret model doutzen kroes took the stage on the opening day alongside leaders like italian prime minister matteo renzi, the event seemed slightly more toned down than in previous years — and in some ways more like a clinton friends-and-family reunion. some of the participants from previous years, including goldman sachs ceo lloyd blankfein and coca-cola ceo muhtar kent, declined invitations this year, a source familiar with the planning said. but former clinton aide doug band attended the opening plenary session. marjorie mezvinsky, whose son is married to chelsea clinton, flashed iphone photos of her grandchildren to friends. stalwart allies including former secretary of state madeleine albright, planned parenthood ceo cecile richards and longtime clinton friend melanne verveer gamely participated in panels, and expressed regret that the organization was winding down. “the decision has been made,” verveer, a former clinton white house aide who now heads up the georgetown institute for women, peace and security, said of shutting down cgi. “it’s really bittersweet. there's a sense of nostalgia.” democrats, meanwhile, have been increasingly incensed at what they see as a double standard applied to the two presidential candidates — especially as more revelations come to light about how trump ran his own foundation. “no one is saying, ‘why don’t you put your hotels aside, or your money-making enterprises aside,’” said dan pfeiffer, a former top aide to president barack obama. “for hillary clinton, for some reason, helping deal with aids in africa is something that should be put aside.” from the stage, at least, bill clinton was careful not to go down the political, or defensive, road. when london mayor sadiq khan tried to bait him into discussing trump — “it’s no coincidence that some of those involved in the brexit campaign are involved in another campaign taking place somewhere else this november,” khan said — clinton smiled but kept his mouth shut. instead, he spent most of his time on stage doing what he can’t do at campaign rallies for his wife: talking at length about his own presidency and his own views of the world. “in my home, i have two beautiful, highly unique samples of large rocks that came out of bosnia,” he said during one panel. “it’s one of the most geologically interesting places on earth.” even if the discussion was about old rocks, there was a sense of anxiety hanging over the conference. when asked how she felt about the tightening polls, verveer winced. “fingers crossed,” she said.      bill clinton preps his defense      
__label__0 egyptian president abdel fattah al-sisi has no qualms about the strength of donald trump as president of the united states. sitting down with cnn’s erin burnett in an interview set to air wednesday night, sisi had two words when asked whether he thought trump would make a strong leader: “no doubt.” story continued below asked whether he and trump discussed the republican nominee’s past proposals and remarks about muslim immigration, sisi made note of the u.s.’ existing “very strict security measures for everyone who wishes to visit it which has been in place for quite a few years.” “it’s also important to know that during election campaigns many statements are made and many things are said, however afterwards governing the country would be something different,” sisi told burnett. “and will be subject to many factors.” burnett pressed, asking whether sisi meant to say that trump “is saying what he needs to say to be elected but that he might not follow through with the plan.” “i don’t want to be unfair to anyone here. during election campaigns there is a perception based on a certain vision and a point of view,” sisi remarked. “then that vision or point of view gets corrected and develops as a result of experience, reports and advice from experts." as far as his separate meeting with hillary clinton, sisi suggested the democratic nominee would make a good president as well. “political parties in the united states would not allow candidates to reach that level unless they are qualified to lead a country the size of the united states of america,” sisi replied. asked about clinton’s comments in a past debate in which she referred the “army dictatorship” under sisi, the egyptian leader hedged his response. “i will answer this question in two ways. i believe that that statement was not made after our most recent meeting between myself and mrs. clinton,” sisi said. “but also in egypt there will not be a chance for any dictatorship because in egypt there is a constitution, there is law, and there the will of the people which will refuse to allow any leader to stay in his position for any period longer than his term which is four years."      egypt's president: 'of course' trump would make a strong leader

in heidenau, germany | matthias rietschel/getty images by hortense goulard 9/21/16, 12:35 pm cet updated 9/21/16, 12:45 pm cet violent acts targeting foreigners and migrants have sharply risen in the eastern part of germany in recent years, the german government warned in a report to be published on october 3, marking the country’s national unity day. the report cites “countless attacks on refugees and their shelters” in the past year as well as outbursts of violence in heidenau and freital, two cities located near dresden in the state of saxony. such attacks are “symbols of a growing hate of foreigners.” excerpts of the report were published on wednesday in the handelsblatt newspaper after the business daily obtained a copy of it. the “worrying trend” could “threaten the peace of the eastern german society,” said iris gleicke according to handelsblatt. gleicke is a member of the government in charge of the country’s former eastern bloc that was under communist rule. areas in former east germany remain poorer than former west germany, with a gdp about a quarter lower than in the west, the report said, adding that differences have largely disappeared since the reunification in 1990. according to statistics, hate crime in the east is well above the rest of the country. in the state of mecklenburg-vorpommern, where the far-right alternative for germany registered an unprecedented electoral success earlier this month, attacks on foreigners and migrants reached 58.7 per million inhabitants. the average for the western part of the country is 10.5, according to handelsblatt. also on politico hortense goulard also on politico hortense goulard also on politico ivo oliveira authorities started tracking violence against foreigners in 2001. it reached its peak in 2015, according to the report. the report also warned that far-right groups have been gaining strength from rising hatred against foreigners, saying that one such terror organization known as the national socialist underground has killed 10 people in recent years. the report noted that there are fewer foreigners in eastern germany than in other parts of the country, underlining the fact that violence and hatred are not the result of the influx of migrants, but rather due to emigration from the east to other, richer parts of the country and a lack of social structures. the report also noted an increase in violent incidents from left-wing radicals in the former east. left-wing militants “misuse demonstrations [against the far-right] and committed a number of criminal acts, sometimes associated with extreme violence, especially against the police,” it said.  © 2016 politico sprl log in to access content and manage your profile. if you do not have a login you can register here.

__label__0 lingering questions about hillary clinton, her email arrangement and alleged pay-for-play with the family foundation during her four years at the state department are not a distraction, spokesman john kirby emphasized wednesday. during a sit-down on "fox & friends," kirby faced off with questions about the situation on the ground in syria and the issue of vetting refugees to the united states before co-host brian kilmeade posed a question about clinton and then took a step back to ask the rear navy admiral what he thought about such questions. story continued below "how much harder is your job being that you had all these things to handle as well as trying to justify what hillary clinton did over the last four years? most of your job is questions about her four years," kilmeade asserted. and it must be -- you must be saying to yourself -- can i just do this job? how much of a distraction has this been?" "look, the job’s hard enough, being a spokesman is tough in any environment. and there's a lot going on in the world," kirby responded. "what we've tried to focus on with respect to this particular issue is our responsibilities at the state department and explaining the policies and regulations that were in place then, the ones that are in place now, and how we're trying to improve going forward." noting that secretary john kerry "has been very, very open and forthright about admitting we can do a better job with our records management at the state department," kirby added, "we want to be more transparent." "you sure? i mean, just don't jump to conclusions," kilmeade said. "we know we can do a better job with records management. and he's hired a former ambassador to come in and do nothing but help us be better at transparency," kirby continued. "look, i don't view it as a distraction. it's part of my job. when you stand up there every day, that's what you gotta do."      state spokesman on clinton questions: 'i don't view it as a distraction'      
__label__0 president barack obama and donald trump are alike in at least one regard, according to former cia director michael hayden. "you know, last week i mentioned there was difference in language between mr. trump and president obama. you know, there's not a whole lot of difference between the obama administration's retrenchment and mr. trump's america first. there are common themes there," hayden said wednesday on msnbc's "morning joe" during a discussion of obama's final united nations address. story continued below hayden, who served as cia director under george w. bush from 2006-2009 and briefly under obama, remarked on msnbc's "morning joe" that the last republican president "probably would have been challenged to make a speech so eloquent as president obama’s yesterday," while adding that bush "would have done so much behind the scenes." "i sat in the oval office. we had a meeting and he would just turn over his shoulder and say, ‘get me [former pakistani president pervez] musharraf.’ he actually worked on the issues and invested his personal energy and i should add personal prestige and political capital in risking that in order to make things different in the world," hayden said. "and sadly, i just don't think we're seeing much of that in the last half a dozen or eight years." former bush aide nicolle wallace offered her own criticism of obama's speech, noting that she heard from middle eastern leaders would likely describe the president's address as "probably decent and perhaps elegant analysis, but he's not an analyst." "what they heard was the complete lack of any connection to any world leaders. he didn't give a speech in that room as though he were in constant contact with anybody else in the room," wallace said. "he gave a speech as if he never talked to these people, as though the only contact were public ones and that that was so different not just from george w. bush, who had better private relationships than some of the conflicts that erupted in public, but ... there hasn't been an american president with fewer or weaker relationships with world leaders." as co-host joe scarborough went on to say that history would judge obama to be a president with few friends on capitol hill regardless of party, wallace chimed in, "he didn't have any friends."      former cia chief: obama's 'retrenchment' like trump's 'america first'      
__label__0 even though donald trump finally acknowledged last week that president barack obama was born in the united states, one of the republican nominee's most prominent allies in law enforcement is not dropping the case. “i don’t care where he’s from,” joe arpaio, sheriff of maricopa county, arizona, told the surprise tea party patriots group on tuesday, according to the arizona republic. “we are looking at a forged document. period.” story continued below arpaio also appeared to dismiss the notion that trump's disavowal of his past birtherism played any role in his determination to keep investigating obama's birth certificate, an inquiry that began in august 2011, four months after the white house released the document. “i know all the politicians say, ‘sheriff, don’t talk about it,’” arpaio said, according to the report. “but how can i back down when we started it? i’m not going to just forget it.” the surprise tea party patriots asked arpaio to look into obama's birthplace in august 2011. “i had nothing to do with trump on the birth certificate,” arpaio said. “we did it on our own, because of you guys.” arpaio also added, "i’m not going to give up, and we’re looking into it ... i don’t know how it’s going to turn out.”      sheriff arpaio on obama birth certificate: 'i'm not going to give up'      
__label__0 hillary clinton campaign manager robby mook drew the ire of the hosts of msnbc's "morning joe” on wednesday when he repeatedly refused to be drawn out on clinton’s views on syria, with an exasperated joe scarborough at one point asking, “we love you, buddy, but what are you here for if you can't answer basic questions?” mook deferred to clinton when asked about the former secretary of state's biggest regret with respect to the handling of the situation in syria. noting, as panelist willie geist had, that clinton was already out of office in 2013 when syrian president bashar assad crossed the white house's "red line" by using chemical weapons on his own people, mook also acknowledged that clinton was in office when the conflict began in 2011. story continued below "well, right, but, you know, she — i think she's well regarded for her leadership as secretary of state. she came out of that office with a 70 percent approval rating. she, in contrast to donald trump, has released a clear and decisive plan to defeat isis. donald trump has said that he thinks he knows more about it than the generals and refuses to tell us what his secret plan is," mook continued. pressed about the red line, mook declined to respond as to whether clinton was "disappointed" about president barack obama's lack of action. "i think you'd have to ask her about that question, how she would characterize it," mook responded, to which geist said, "well, you're here to speak for her, robby. you haven't discussed that at all?" laughing, mook remarked, "look, what matters is what she is going to do as president. as i said, she has a clear plan to defeat isis. donald trump does not. it's a secret. he won't tell anybody what it is and he says he knows more than the generals. i think the choice is clear." asked what clinton would do on day one in syria, mook rehashed clinton's talking points and directed viewers to the campaign website. panelist mike barnicle, while acknowledging that mook is not the candidate herself, posed a hypothetical debate question for clinton at next monday's debate, asking what the former secretary of state would do to provide aid to the people of eastern aleppo after the bombing of a relief convoy, differently from the obama administration. "again, i think you're going to have to ask her that question. that's a matter of policy, and i'm going to leave it for her to determine that," mook said. scarborough then snapped, "we love you, buddy, but what are you here for if you can't answer basic questions? i mean, i don't know if there's a — i mean, we may be tiptoeing into gary johnson territory here if you don't know the answer to that basic of a question. ... then why do we have you here?" (the libertarian presidential nominee stumbled on the same show earlier this month when he asked, "what is aleppo?" in response to a question about the conflict.) "i think — look, you're asking new policy questions. you would have to ask the secretary for that," mook said. "my job's not to set policy." "new?" scarborough responded incredulously. "aleppo's been around for — syria's been around for some time. the red line being drawn has been around for some time. i'm not being difficult here at all. these are basic questions." "and i'm not being difficult either. i'm simply saying that she has laid out a plan to defeat isis, and if there are new questions pertaining to aleppo, i'm going to need to let her answer those, and she will answer those in the debate, and we look forward to her having the opportunity to do that," mook said. "and as i said, donald trump has been able — unable, rather, to release a plan, and we hope that he will reveal what his plans are in the debate." as the interview drew to a close, geist asked mook about clinton's current thinking on no-fly zones in syria, given her past support. "i'm going to let her statements speak for themselves," mook said, smiling and laughing. geist followed up, "robby, aren't you here representing her point of view?" "i am, indeed, and i'm gonna let her language speak for itself," mook said, to which geist responded that the clinton aide was saying that trump would not clarify his policy at the same time he would not address questions about his own candidate's. "you are quoting secretary clinton's plans as she's laid them out. i'm going to let them speak for themselves," mook repeated. "donald trump has not laid out a single plan." moments after concluding the interview, scarborough remarked to the panel, "so what's going on? i don't understand that. i'm completely flummoxed by that interview." "i mean, first of all, are they pleased, and openness with the press," he said, referring to mook's comments earlier in the same interview to that effect. "i heard after the pneumonia deal they all were chastened and changing their relationship and trying to be more open with the press. won't respond into aleppo. won't respond to the no-fly zone. what's going on here? better not to come on." brad woodhouse, president of the pro-clinton super pac correct the record, ripped into the show for its line of questioning. woodhouse retweeted the los angeles times' mike memoli, who asked, "how much time does @morning_joe crew think a campaign manager is spending on syria policy 50 days out?"

__label__0 donald trump’s former campaign manager, corey lewandowski, will continue to be paid severance by the campaign through the end of 2016, prolonging concerns of a conflict of interest for cnn, which controversially hired lewandowski in june to serve as a political commentator. in addition, cnn shot down reports on wednesday that lewandowski was being suspended by the channel. “corey lewandowski, who is no longer involved in the campaign, continues to receive monthly severance payments,” trump press secretary hope hicks told the washington post wednesday. “the campaign will continue to honor its contract with mr. lewandowski, which stipulates he will be paid through the end of the year. these payments are in no way compensation for services rendered.” politico reported on tuesday evening that the trump campaign had paid lewandowski's firm $20,000 in august, according to campaign filings, for "strategy consulting." as the washington post pointed out, the description of the payment as "strategy consulting" appeared to contradict cnn’s claim that lewandowski was being paid by the trump campaign only for severance. campaign employees being paid severance for so long after their departures is unusual, and it's not entirely clear why on the fec forms the trump campaign continues to call payments to lewandowski as "strategy consulting" (we've reached out to the campaign for clarification and will update here accordingly). in an appearance on fox news radio, campaign manager kellyanne conway stressed that the payment is still part of his severance and pointed out that cnn also employs as commentators people who work for pro-clinton super pacs. "he is not part of the campaign, he is a paid adviser on cnn and i think he's excellent in his job, frankly. corey does not have a formal or informal role with the campaign whatsoever," conway said. mediaite on wednesday reported that lewandowski was being suspended by the channel following the new statement, but a spokesperson for the cable channel said the report was false, and that lewandowski would be appearing on air later today. cnn president jeff zucker had for months defended the cable channel’s decision to hire lewandowski. on tuesday, the cable network head said at a company town hall for staff that the network "needed to bring in voices supportive of the republican nominee to balance its commentary ranks," the huffington post reported. lewandowski has signed a non-disclosure agreement with the trump campaign, and as part of that agreement agreed to a non-disparagement clause, according to the associated press which extends beyond his time working for the campaign. as politico reported earlier this month, lewandowski has been playing a wider role in the campaign recently, even if he technically is not an official part of it.      corey lewandowski to be paid severance by trump campaign through 2016

__label__0 donald trump on wednesday suggested that oklahoma police officer betty shelby may have choked when she shot dead terence crutcher on the side of a highway last week in tulsa. speaking at a church in cleveland heights, ohio, the republican presidential nominee said, "this young officer, i don't know what she was thinking. i don't know what she was thinking, but i'm very, very troubled by that. i'm very, very troubled by that. and we have to be very — we have to be very careful." story continued below he added, "now, did she get scared? was she choking? what happened? but maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, okay? they can't be doing what they're doing." on crutcher, he said, "i watched the shooting in particular in tulsa. and that man was hands up. that man went to the car, hands up, put his hand on the car. i mean, to me, it looked like he did everything you're supposed to do, and he looked like a really good man." trump called, via twitter, for an "immediate end" to the unrest in charlotte, north carolina, that broke out after a police shooting of a black man on tuesday, the latest in a string of such fatal shootings that also included last week's shooting of crutcher. "hopefully the violence & unrest in charlotte will come to an immediate end. to those injured, get well soon. we need unity & leadership," trump tweeted on wednesday morning, also writing, "the situations in tulsa and charlotte are tragic. we must come together to make america safe again." violent protests have rocked charlotte in the past 24 hours, as demonstrators demand answers as to why keith lamont scott was shot dead by police tuesday night in a parking lot of an apartment complex. police said scott was holding a gun, while his family said he was sitting in his car reading a book. that shooting follows the fatal incident in tulsa, in which crutcher was shot dead by shelby on the side of a highway, after she claimed he was behaving strangely and feared he was reaching for a weapon. trump, who has positioned himself as the "law and order candidate," has been criticized in the past for what some see as opportunistic reactions to tragic events. last month, he sparked outrage when he tweeted in response to a chicago shooting which killed nykea aldridge, dwyane wade's cousin. he was accused of being insensitive, and using the incident to further his political agenda, tweeting, "dwayne [sic] wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in chicago. just what i have been saying. african-americans will vote trump!" the republican presidential nominee has, in recent weeks, been trying to appeal to black voters. many denounced his comments tuesday in kenansville, north carolina, when he said that black communities in the united states are "in the worst shape ever." he raised similar controversy last month in another appeal to black voters when he said "what the hell do you have to lose?" by trying something new like trump. democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton, who on tuesday called crutcher's shooting "intolerable," also weighed in on wednesday morning, tweeting, "keith lamont scott. terence crutcher. too many others. this has got to end. -h."      trump suggests tulsa officer was 'choking' in fatal shooting      
__label__0 i was a democrat all my life. i came to washington to serve president john kennedy and attorney general robert kennedy. when the president was murdered and his brother struck off on his own, i joined his senate campaign and staff as his legislative assistant and speechwriter, until his presidential campaign ended with his own assassination. i ran on a (losing) democratic ticket in the new york state elections of 1970. when i was working to enact my own program of police reform in the 1980s and 1990s, then-governor bill clinton was chairman of my national committee for the police corps. this year, i will vote to elect donald trump as president of the united states. story continued below so profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision. here it is. john and robert kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. to them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. but today’s democrats have become the party of war: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. we have american military bases in 80 countries, and there are now american military personnel on the ground in about 130 countries, a remarkable achievement since there are only 192 recognized countries. generals and admirals announce our national policies. theater commanders are our principal ambassadors. our first answer to trouble or opposition of any kind seems always to be a military movement or action. nor has the democratic party candidate for president this year, hillary clinton, sought peace. instead she has pushed america into successive invasions, successive efforts at “regime change.” she has sought to prevent americans from seeking friendship or cooperation with president vladimir putin of russia by characterizing him as “another hitler.” she proclaims herself ready to invade syria immediately after taking the oath of office. her shadow war cabinet brims with the architects of war and disaster for the past decades, the neocons who led us to our present pass, in iraq, in afghanistan, syria, libya, yemen, in ukraine, unrepentant of all past errors, ready to resume it all with fresh trillions and fresh blood. and the democrats she leads seem intent on worsening relations with russia, for example by sending american warships into the black sea, or by introducing nuclear weapons ever closer to russia itself. in fact, in all the years of the so-called war on terror, only one potential american president has had the intelligence, the vision, the sheer sanity to see that america cannot fight the entire world at once; who sees that america’s natural and necessary allies in this fight must include the advanced and civilized nations that are most exposed and experienced in their own terror wars, and have the requisite military power and willingness to use it. only one american candidate has pointed out how senseless it is to seek confrontation with russia and china, at the same time that we are trying to suppress the very jihadist movements that they also are attacking. that candidate is donald trump. throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with president putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. on this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election. it must also be said: mr. trump is an imperfect candidate, and he would surely be an imperfect president. he is crude, often vulgar. he has areas of great ignorance. he insults people and inflicts unnecessary harm. he would be twice the candidate he is if he used half the words. he is often intemperate; though it is not trump but his opponent who is so intemperate as to compare putin’s moves in ukraine to what hitler did—an insult that throughout all the cold war and to this day, no american president has ever offered to any soviet or russian leader, not even the enormous butcher josef stalin, with whom in fact we joined to win the second world war. and it is not mr. trump but michael morell, a former cia director now high in the councils of the democratic candidate, who has publicly suggested, without rebuke from anyone, that we should begin “killing russians,” a doubly illegal act of war. moreover trump marks himself as a man of singular political courage, willing to defy the hysteria of the washington war hawks, the establishment and the mainstream media who daily describe him as virtually anti-american for daring to voice ideas and opinions at variance with their one-note devotion to war. *** john kennedy admired political courage. he began his first campaign for congress at the height of the cold war by saying, “above all, day and night, with every ounce of ingenuity and industry we possess, we must work for peace. we must not have another war.” years later, in the cuban missile crisis of 1962, he and his brother had to overcome great opposition from their own military commanders, government officials and other public leaders, to prevent a war with the soviet union: there were 13 men in the excomm room, and robert kennedy said that had any 1 of 8 of them been president, the crisis would have exploded in nuclear war. but within a year thereafter, deeply affected by the barely-averted catastrophe, president kennedy had forged a close working relationship with soviet leader nikita khrushchev, spoke all over the country to promote peace policies, and delivered his historic american university speech of 1963. our “strategy of peace,” he said, was “not a pax americana enforced on the world by american weapons of war.” rather it must be founded on negotiation, cooperation in areas of mutual interest, and recognition that “our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. we all breathe the same air. we all cherish our children’s future. and we are all mortal.” as to our great adversary the soviet union, he said, “we must reexamine our own attitude—as individuals and as a nation—for our attitude is as essential as theirs.” six months later he was dead; and it was robert kennedy who must resume the effort. robert kennedy made ratification of the nuclear test ban treaty the early centerpiece of his senate career. but as president lyndon johnson escalated the war in vietnam, it was that war which forced robert kennedy to make his doomed race for the presidency. wherever he campaigned in 1968, to virtually every audience, he spoke of the loss, the horror, the infinite tragedy of that war, in words that could be and must be repeated today, after 15 consecutive years of wars all over the world. “our brave young men,” he said, “are dying in the swamps of southeast asia. which of them might have written a poem? which of them might have cured cancer? which of them might have played in a world series or given us the gift of laughter from the stage or helped build a bridge or a university? which of them would have taught a child to read? it is our responsibility to let these men live ... it is indecent if they die because of the empty vanity of their country.” he also urged that we consider the vietnamese mother, desperately trying to shield her baby from the fire from the sky, sent by machines from a country she could barely understand. he demanded of his colleagues, on the senate floor, to answer what gave us the right to destroy remote villages on the other side of the world, to arrogate to ourselves the power of god, the rule of life and death over others. “all this is our responsibility,” he said, “not just a nation’s responsibility but yours and mine.” john and robert kennedy were no pacifists, nor ignorant of the realities of power. but they required that great power be used with great precision and restraint, and with humility. both knew that their own lives were hostage to the possibility of assassination, yet they kept trying to guide us toward peace up to the moments of their death. the legacy of jfk & rfk is “being abandoned by today’s democratic party.” theirs is the legacy that is being abandoned by today’s democratic party. we have broken one middle eastern nation after another. hundreds of cities and villages lie in ruins, hundreds of thousands are dead, millions are refugees; and, for all the press and political thundering against the menace of isis, al qaeda, or islamic terrorism generally, our military leaders offer no prospects of victory. they cannot tell us what victory would require or mean; though they are quick to assure us, as in libya today, that this conflict will go on indefinitely. they cannot even explain how some of our current allies (example turkey) are bombing and shelling others of our purported allies (example the kurds). so a democratic administration, carrying on the work of the bush presidency, without thought and without question, year after year, has kept sending more young men and women into the grinder. scores of democratic elected officials once spoke and worked tirelessly to end our disastrous war in vietnam. today there is only the voice of the marvelous democratic member of congress tulsi gabbard, a reservist who has twice deployed to iraq and knows of what she speaks. and it is a democratic president who sends an endless parade of drones to nations all over the world, flaunting for all to see america’s unique military technology, coupled with our seeming complete carelessness in how that technological prowess destroys people and nations. most amazing of all, however, is that as we proclaim that the terrorists threaten europe, threaten the united states, threaten western civilization itself—as we face all this, we do not concentrate our military might against this unique threat. where are we sending our warriors, our ships, our planes? why to russia, which the u.s. general who commands nato has announced is the prime “existential” threat to america. as you read this, ground, air and naval forces of nato, led and largely paid for by the united states, have been moving about the western borders of russia, carrying out the largest military maneuvers since world war ii. at the same time, our most powerful carriers and naval air forces have been steaming about the south china sea, there perhaps to find encounters of unknowable potential with the rising forces of china, our second said to be “existential” enemy. there are no russian terrorists ravaging france or italy or america. isis is not to be found on russian soil. the only russian terrorists who have attacked the west are the islamists whom president putin first asked us to join in the fight against in 1999. the only chinese terrorists are uighurs who are attacking not us but china itself. it would seem elementary common sense that america would have long since sought, not to fight with russia and china, but to cooperate with both to suppress the terrorists and the terrorism that have plagued us for over a generation, including the isis that is terrorizing europe today. former defense secretary william perry, a democrat, warns that we are now, today, “on the threshold of a new cold war. ... a new nuclear arms race. ... the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe is actually greater than it was during the cold war.” surely the wars and threats of war already on our horizon would be more than enough for any empire; and our empire, as every thoughtful person knows, is already staggering under the immeasurable loads of debt piled up by america, by our governments, our corporations, our households, our students, and our promises of unlimited benefits in the future. the years of constant combat have exhausted our military. false hopes and vain promises of victory have burnt up the caches of idealism and patriotic commitment with which we began the wars a generation ago. our forces are worn out, especially the elite warrior units that have been constantly deployed for more than a decade. but, ominously, there is more to come, more that already stares us in the face. the dire events of this summer have shown us the true danger that lurks here at home. this is not a danger imported from syria or iraq or russia. our greatest menace is the danger of our own history, our inheritance to the latest day. for the fact is that while we chased a chimera of peace and justice in lands far from our own, imposing ourselves and our concepts on strangers who rejected our teachings, we were neglecting our own country and our own people, our own neighbors, our own children and our own friends. and now we can see the result. the violence we took to other countries bounces back to our own. the money we squandered on bombs in iraq was not available for our own schools. the brilliant young men and women, who gave up their bodies and their lives on distant battlefields, were not here to teach and mentor and guide the young people of the ghetto. they were not here to police the mean streets, to suppress and eliminate the crime that is the greatest cause of poverty. they were not here to bring the protection and the blessings of the american constitution to the least among us. they were not here to protect american cities and enrich american lives. and they were not here to keep americans and american children from murdering american police officers. this is our true present danger. *** so my hope for america is this. first, we must begin immediately to end our involvement in endless, unnecessary and therefore murderous wars. we need our best young people to help us here at home. we need to stop the reckless military spending on more destructive armaments. we need to breathe free again. we must and will defend civilized order against its deadly enemies. isis and its brethren must be eliminated: no quarter, no hesitation. but we will need to engage all civilized peoples in our mutual defense. we must abandon foolish skirmishes and petty jealousies. we must end our reflexive efforts to dominate other developed nations, especially russia and china. president kennedy told us over and over that our own peace and security, in this dangerous world, would depend upon peaceful and cooperative relations with russia and the russian people; indeed, at the end of his presidency, ronald reagan said the same. fools in washington, intent on world domination, would have us ignore that wisdom now. but it is the wisdom that we need to preserve the world and our children’s future. second, we must at the same time begin to recover our domestic peace. there are many ills to be cured, many shortcomings to be righted. but nothing can be accomplished in the midst of a war against police, an insurrection against the constitution itself. our clear priority is reinforcement of our police and police departments. we need many more and better police. we need them to be better trained, not as warriors but as shepherds, as leaders and teachers of the young, as peacemakers in communities that have not known real peace for many years. we need our very best young people, not getting their legs blown off by ieds in afghanistan, but saving all of our lives in st. louis and chicago and detroit and baton rouge and all the other wasted places in our own land. donald trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, “america first.” but to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of american statesmen from the founders on. only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond. finally, our president has told us we must lower our voices. of course we do not hope for domestic discord. but the people of the united states have perhaps stood silent for too long. the elites of opinion and government have not hesitated to offer us instruction, from the heights of their power and eminence. these are the people who have led us into useless foreign war and limitless domestic disaster. this president tells us that we must now spend another trillion dollars on new nuclear weapons systems, and when we ask who will be the target for these world-destroying weapons, says only, “there can be no business as usual with russia.” surely he must have misspoken, for anyone can see we are on a course of madness. we simply cannot fight the entire world, russia and china and all the nations of the mideast, and fight a war at home all at the same time. and therefore we citizens must not be silent, we must speak as with one great overwhelming voice, a voice as powerful as washington, as jefferson, as lincoln, as martin luther king: return to the wisdom of the founders, who fought necessary wars to defend the union, but sought no foreign conquests. do not step over the threshold of a new cold war, a new nuclear arms race with russia and china, but seek to enlist them in common ventures to resist the forces of terror and chaos that threaten all civilization. commit to our own domestic peace and security, rather than persist in a vain effort to control the lives and affairs of 200 foreign nations. this, as i understand it, is the platform of donald trump. it was not the republican party platform, and he had to overcome much opposition within his party to gain the nomination. but it is his platform. it is the platform he has restated again and again, with determination, and with the courage and persistence to outlast his critics. it is a platform that, even in these troubled days, could fulfill the hopes of the greatest americans of all parties. well may we seek reassurance whether mr. trump has the kind of cool judgment and self-possession that the presidency requires; the judgment that comes to the fore in crisis, that saves a nation or perhaps a world. no one can ever truly know how a future president will react to such enormous pressures. but trump has given some evidence. he set himself a unique course toward the office, disdaining conventional wisdom, speaking more truth about politics and about america than any conventional consultant or adviser thought prudent or wise. and yet it is his independence, his willingness to name facts however unpleasant, together with his great political courage, that can give us hope and even some confidence that he may be up to the job. perhaps most important, he has proven that he is not intimidated by the generals and admirals who have up to this day had their unimpeded way with our wars and our budgets, to the immense loss of both. flawed as he may be, trump is telling more of the truth than politicians of our day. most important, he offers a path away from constant war, a path of businesslike accommodation with all reasonable people and nations, concentrating our forces and efforts against the true enemies of civilization. thus, to dwell on his faults and errors is to evade the great questions of war and peace, life and death for our people and our country. you and i will have to compensate for his deficits of civility, in return for peace, we may hope as lincoln hoped, among ourselves and with all nations. truly, america first, last and always; for ourselves and for our posterity. these are the reasons why i will vote for donald trump for president.      i was rfk’s speechwriter. now i’m voting for trump. here’s why.

"i don't find that a heavy lift at all to do the work i have to do to tell people hillary’s story," kaine added, drawing on their biographical parallels as midwesterners who "both grew up in republican families ... in small business families" and "in religious households." kaine added, "i kind of know the vibe. i know that for example, for her it’s not easy for her to talk about herself, that’s just not the way we were raised, but it’s easier for me to talk about her so that’s something i like to do is to tell stories about things she’s done that really show who she is as a person and the kind of president she’ll be."      kaine doesn't feel bad for pence      
__label__0 when it comes to the trump campaign's allegations of "inaccuracies and omissions" against a washington post story, running mate mike pence struggled late tuesday night to account for specific examples. appearing on msnbc's "the 11th hour with brian williams" after an evening rally in williamsburg, virginia, the indiana governor backed up the trump campaign's statement against the post's reporting earlier in the day that donald trump spent $258,000 from his charitable foundation to settle legal issues. story continued below "well, i think what we found is that there is a number of factual errors in that story as there were in previous stories about the trump foundation. i'm confident they'll be able to address those and demonstrate that they fully complied with the law," pence told brian williams, adding that the "larger issue" is the clinton foundation. williams tried to button up the issue, pressing pence specifically for "what the factual errors are that the campaign is alleging" from the latest post story. "well, i think the foundation will be able to lay those out. there were errors in the previous washington post stories, and, you know, look, you know me a while, brian. i strongly support a free and independent press. people are entitled to ask questions, and i'm sure the trump foundation and the trump family will continue to be able to answer those questions." pence's comments and the trump campaign statement came hours after the latest article from the post into the republican nominee's charitable foundation.      pence gives no specifics on why trump foundation story is inaccurate      
__label__0 the man charged with bombings in new york and new jersey will be taken to federal court in manhattan soon to face federal criminal charges, attorney general loretta lynch said wednesday. while federal court complaints against ahmad rahami were filed in new york and new jersey tuesday evening and he also faces state charges in new jersey, federal prosecutors in new york are set to take the lead in prosecuting rahami, lynch signaled in her remarks to an international bar association conference. story continued below "in the near future, it is our intention to bring the defendant to the federal district court for the southern district of new york, which has jurisdiction over the manhattan neighborhood where more than 30 innocent people were wounded—and countless others were gravely endangered – by his bombs," lynch said in prepared remarks released by the justice department. "i have full confidence that the u.s. attorney's office for the southern district of new york, led by preet bharara, will succeed in bringing the defendant to justice for his heinous actions. and i know that the u.s. attorney's office for the district of new jersey, led by paul fishman, will also seek to hold the defendant accountable for his deplorable actions in their district," lynch added. the head of the office that handles indigent defense in federal courts in new york wrote to the federal magistrate judge assigned to rahami's case there late tuesday, urging that the accused be brought to court wednesday. the letter suggested that rahami was being subjected to protracted questioning by investigators without the benefit of legal counsel. rahami has been under guard at a newark hospital where he was taken after a monday morning gun battle with police that left the suspect and two police officers wounded. during her speech wednesday to the international lawyers' group, lynch also called for calm in the wake of recent shootings of african-american motorists by police in tulsa and charlotte. she said the justice department's civil rights division has already opened an investigation into the tulsa shooting and officials are assessing what happened in charlotte. protests overnight in charlotte blocked an interstate highway there and turned violent, with 16 officers injured as well as several demonstrators. “these tragic incidents have once again left americans with feelings of sorrow, anger and uncertainty. they have once again highlighted – in the most vivid and painful terms – the real divisions that still persist in this nation between law enforcement and communities of color. and in charlotte, they have once again led to widespread protest. unfortunately, we saw several instances of violence," lynch said in her prepared speech. lynch noted an american tradition of protest against perceived injustice, but she warned that resorting to violence is counterproductive. "protest is protected by our constitution and is a vital instrument for raising issues and creating change. but when it turns violent, it undermines the very justice that it seeks to achieve and i urge those demonstrating in charlotte to remain peaceful in their expressions of protest and concern," the attorney general added.      lynch: bombing suspect will be taken to new york in 'near future'

"and somehow that resonated." "some people didn't like it. but i said, what difference does it make? i mean, it's true," he said, to laughter.

__label__0 speaker paul ryan said on wednesday he expects the house will vote to override any presidential veto of a bill that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue saudi arabia, despite his concerns that the measure could touch off a wave of retaliatory lawsuits. “i really don’t know the answer to that question,” ryan (r-wis.) said when asked if the house would take up a veto override this month before congress prepares to leave until after election day. but ryan did not say exactly when he expected the override vote to happen. story continued below “it depends on how long it takes for us to get our other work done. i heard that the senate majority leader said they’re going to stay so if we’re in and they pass it, then it’s going to come over here and we’ll pass it,” he added. president barack obama has said he will veto the measure, which passed both chambers unanimously, in part over concerns that the bill could open up u.s. officials to legal retaliation in foreign courts. he has until the end of the week to issue his veto. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) said his chamber will take up the veto override vote before leaving for recess. ryan said he has concerns with the bill, listing many of the same complaints voiced by the white house, but that shouldn’t stop the veto override from coming up for a vote. “i worry about legal matters. i worry about trial lawyers trying to get rich off of this. and i do worry about precedence. at the same time, these victims need to have their day in court,” ryan told reporters. “i do have concerns about the legislation but i’m going to let congress work its will because that’s what congress does. i do think the votes are there for the override.”      ryan says house will vote to override any veto of 9/11 bill      
__label__1 target garnered intense criticism for a christmas sweater that seemingly mocked people who suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder. the store received backlash from customers who felt the sweater, which had the phrase “obsessive christmas disorder” written on the front, belittled and mocked a serious mental disorder.  “as someone with ocd i’d really appreciate it if you didn’t sell my illness as a fashion statement,” twitter user reign murphy tweeted alongside a photo of her holding up the sweater.   others reacted similarly to the controversy, with several blasting the retail giant for mocking a “serious mental illness.” "today at target i saw a sweater that said 'ocd obsessive christmas disorder'…why is trivializing a mental disorder so widely accepted?” one tweet about the sweater read. target ultimately responded to the backlash with an apology, but stopped short of removing the item from its stores. “we never want to disappoint our guests and we apologize for any discomfort. we currently do not have plans to remove this sweater,” spokesman josh thomas said in the statement.  target was previously the center of similar controversy regarding a sign that referenced “building sets” and “girls’ building sets” for sale. it was also criticized for selling a women's t-shirt with the word “trophy” on the front, which inspired a successful petition for its removal. “the truth is that millions of women and young girls are taken as ‘trophies’ every year in war, sex trafficking, slavery, and rape,” the petition said, fortune reported. “labeling any person as a ‘trophy’ is demeaning their humanity and objectifying them as a tangible object that can be bought, used, and disposed of.” target responded to that controversy by apologizing for offending customers. “it is never our intention to offend anyone,” the company’s statement read. “these shirts are intended as a fun wink and we have received an overwhelmingly positive response from our guests.” sources: usa today, fortune / photo credit: reign murphy/twitter via spectacular photo wonders       ocd sweater at target sparks controversy (photo)      
__label__1 a hardworking farmer went on abc's reality show "shark tank" to pitch his product, which simply exists to improve the lives of other farmers, and was mocked for his lack of business expertise (video below). but by the end of his pitch, he had an investor and had won over the hearts of all the sharks on the panel. johnny georges, a farmer and the inventor of the tree t-pee, brought his invention to "shark tank," seeking an investment to help sell his product nationwide. as he explained his product to the panel of sharks and revealed that he had only sold within five counties of his florida farm, the sharks were stunned. they began nearly mocking him for his lack of business experience and questioning how the company was expected to succeed.  georges tried to explain that he wants to do what is right and to help other farmers, so he only makes $1 per tree t-pee. the judges were shocked he hadn't expanded his market or raised his prices, but he remained faithful to the greater cause. finally, georges' character won the hearts of the panel and john paul dejoria, co-founder of hair care product company paul mitchell, offered to give him exactly what he asked for. the moral of this story is certainly to stay true to who you are and what you believe in. watch georges' "shark tank" pitch below.        naive farmer dismissed during 'shark tank' pitch (video)

__label__1 the weiner is back, yet again, in the news and if you thought he couldn’t get any more disgusting, well you would be stupid…i mean, come on. it’s anthony “douche” weiner…i like the sound of that. anyways, back in january, anthony weiner, 51, who at the time wasn’t in the process of divorce with top hillary clinton aide huma abedin, supposedly engaged in a months-long online sexual relationship with a troubled 15 year-old girl whose name is being withheld for obvious reasons.  “i have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people i have communicated with online and the things i have sent,” stated weiner as he was interviewed on foxnews online. the details are this. back in january of 2016, weiner had developed a knowing online sexting relationship with a 15 year-old girl. we know that he knew she was 15 because using the kik, a popular social media app, he had asked the girl what high school she went to. yeah, that kind of drains all doubt that he didn’t know she was underage. let’s not forget, this man is married. so sexting with anyone but his wife still reveals that he’s just as horrible a person as ever…except now we know just how disgusting and evil this piece of turd is. both the girl and weiner sent sexually charged pictures and texts back and forth. weiner also eventually ended up at the girl’s home when her father wasn’t there. the girl claims that he prodded her into deeper sexual conversation until she stated she wasn’t comfortable with where it was heading and he immediately stopped.   the girl’s father is justifiably enraged by what has transpired and claims his daughter’s mental health is in jeopardy. “if there’s anybody out there that has a similar story that they can come forward, maybe use my daughter’s example to have the courage to come forward, i agreed because her mental health is in jeopardy and i didn’t want to exacerbate anything that she has mentally going on,” he continued. she’s gone through some depression, we’ve sought counseling and been able to help her work through it, he said. she’s a bright girl, very smart, so this has somewhat dulled the light that she had previous to this…it’s gut-wrenching to see somebody take that away.” alright dad. wiener is a scumbag and he is a sexual predator, no doubt…but let’s give some sense of responsibility to where it’s due. your daughter engaged in the relationship. she is not some innocent angel you believe she is. how the hell does weiner end up inside your home? did he break in? just be honest about it. weiner’s a sick piece of trash that most likely will serve jail time. about time.       weiner gets caught again! this time with a 15 yr-old!?

__label__1 obama has known from the very beginning that there are terrorists among the unvetted refugees he is bringing in. that was a certainty. he just doesn’t care. when he first said he wanted to bring in 10,000 refugees, i laughed. i told people he was planning on 250,000 and people laughed at me. now he says 110,000 and i’m telling you, it will be way more than that and many of them will be isis connected. obama is not only terraforming the us into a muslim nation, he is deliberately bringing terror and chaos to our streets to destroy us. just as he has done with race wars. it’s been the plan all along. now they have the chutzpah to actually admit they know it, but they are still defending their actions. they have no intention of slowing down, much less stopping the influx. this is one of those areas that i agree with donald trump on… this must be stopped until we can adequately vet these people. obama now knows that hillary could lose, so he is doubling down on this and violence and death will follow.  from the daily caller: islamic state terrorists have tried to pose as refugees in order to gain admittance to the u.s., department of state spokesman john kirby admitted wednesday. “i wouldn’t debate the fact that there’s the potential for isis terrorists to try to insert themselves,” kirby said on fox news. “and we’ve seen that in some of the refugee camps in jordan and in turkey, where they try to insert themselves into the population.” he was defending president barack obama’s plan to bring in 110,000 new refugees in the next year, a huge increase from the 70,000 the u.s. typically admits, saying the vetting process is “good.” any sane leader after having their country hit with numerous terrorist attacks, many of which are directly traceable to refugees, would back off and consider their actions and the consequences. but not obama. we got hit by at least three terrorist attacks last week and he went to the un and went all out for bringing in far more refugees. obama hates america and he is a traitor to this country. every action he has taken while in office screams that he is an enemy within. yet, we are doing virtually nothing to stop him. terrorism and dead americans are the result of our apathy and complacency. obama and his administration admit that this will end in terrorism. we know it will too. why are we just letting this happen? has america lost her will to fight and survive?        state department admits terrorists are posing as refugees – obama moves to increase intake…      
__label__1 nascar is under fire like never before, quite like this nation. earlier this week we reported that nascar was getting sued $500 million after being accused of having unfair advantages for race car drivers. specifically white race car drivers. terrance cox iii, who is the ceo of diversity motorsports, filed the racial discrimination claim due to minorities being denied basically any chance in the sport of nascar. nascar quickly came out with a statement explaining why all of that was wrong.  here’s what cox stated: “in 2016, motorsports remain the most racially segregated sport in the united states. [nascar has] been complicit in, and supportive of, the racially discriminatory environment that virtually excludes african americans from meaningful participation in motorsports racing in the united states.” nascar however completely disagrees seeing that they have programs designed specifically to end racial discrimination in the sport. “diversity both on and off the track continues to be a top priority for nascar and its stakeholders. we stand behind our actions, and will not let a publicity-seeking legal action deter us from our mission.” whether we believe it or not, racial discrimination is still present here in america. nascar may not be guilty of it, but america as a whole is. recently police in charlotte, nc shot a black man and killed him. keith lamont scott was approached by police when they were searching for a man under warrant. scott was not the man they were looking for, but police stated that he appeared to be holding a gun. according to onlookers and family, scott was reportedly holding a book that he was reading beforehand, and it looked like that was enough to lead policemen to believe it was a weapon.  because of this act, people of charlotte were completely outraged. they began protesting on that day and have not stopped protesting since. just last night, protesters went wild and violent. one person was shot while multiple shops and buildings were looted. one of those buildings was the nascar hall of fame in charlotte. they have closed down for now, according to bob pockrass, reporter at espn. “nascar has closed its charlotte office for normal business today. during the unrest wednesday night in charlotte, windows were broken on the ground floor of the building tower where nascar offices occupy several floors.” here’s a news video of the past 24 hours in charlotte.  we are praying not only for the members of nascar but for this nation. that we would see the love of god prevail throughout these horrible times.      breaking: nascar shuts down after protests

[…] the protest leaders are encouraging the community to fight back. after keith scott came after a cop with a gun and was shot dead. […] keith scott wasn’t holding a book. he was holding a gun and had a holster strapped to his leg. currently, one protester is hanging on to life in critical condition after a second night of rioting. he was shot in the head by another protester. cops and protesters have both been sent to hospitals and the violence is getting worse. the governor has now declared an emergency in charlotte and the national guard have been called in. a curfew is being considered as well. scott charged those officers before he was shot and killed. chief kerr putney told reporters on wednesday that officer brentley vinson saw scott with a handgun and that scott would not drop it after being ordered to do so. the officer that shot him followed procedure and did the right thing here. but it hardly matters… any excuse will do… any lie will do to start a race war and a riot. charlotte exemplifies that. in the meantime, the riots continue and it is only a matter of time at this rate until someone is killed. looting is rampant and the media have been attacked and brutalized. a photographer was shoved to the ground and then protesters tried to throw him into a fire. this is the chaos and violence obama has been fomenting in our streets. it’s about to explode massively.        breaking: dash cam footage released – shows keith scott coming at police with gun in hand…      
__label__1 rioters have taken over charlotte, north carolina. the situation has become so bad that governor pat mccrory has declared a state of emergency and called in the national guard. one person isn’t having it though and that’s sheriff david clarke. nicknamed “america’s sheriff,” clarke is known for his commonsense approach to controversial issues and his politically incorrect devotion to telling it like it is. sheriff clarke was on stuart varney’s show on the fox business network and weighed in on the riots in charlotte, and he hit the nail right on the head. clarke completely rejected the idea that the rioters were actually protesters trying to combat racial injustice. “this has become a political construct and i said that four months in december of 2014 after ferguson,” clarke said. “i know these people, i know what they’re up to, i know their mode. these are anarchists! the anarchists are exploiting these poor people in these urban ghettos to be the riot starters so until the police commanders start to understand what this movement is – all they have to do is go back to the war on cops in the 60’s.”  riots in charlotte. @sheriffclarke: these are anarchists… a soft approach from police just won't work. #varneyco pic.twitter.com/brfsecoh4b — varney & co.

__label__1 some athletes have taken to pulling ridiculous stunts during games to show their solidarity with the black lives matter movement. but not cam newton — the carolina panthers quarterback lives in charlotte and is seeing firsthand the damage these “protests” are causing his community. the riots have caused widespread damage, multiple police officers have been injured and at least one person has been killed. and newton has had enough. he held a press conference to comment on the riots in charlotte and criticized the black community’s response to the recent shooting of a black man by police, which is what spawned the riots. “i’m an african american. i’m not happy what or how justice has been dealt with over the years — the state of oppression in our community,” he said. “but we also as black people have to do right by ourselves, we can’t be hypocrites.” he also slammed the violence of the rioters. “when you get a person who does some unjust things or killing an innocent person, killing fathers, killing people who have actual families, that’s real,” he explained. “i have a son. and a daughter i’m responsible for. and how they feel if one day they come home and there’s no more daddy? we need people to be held accountable is that’s all.” newton also criticized the black lives matter protesters for focusing too much on race. “it doesn’t matter the race,” he said. “i don’t see that through a black/white lens. i could look at you and be around you and i can tell if you’re a good person. there’s good people that doesn’t have a badge on, there’s good people that has a badge on.”   police aren’t all bad, newton also claimed, something that likely infuriated the black lives matter protesters. “we all know people who are in the police department. and we also know bad people that’s civilians, and just bad people who are police officers. that’s just life as a whole,” he said. “we all have to as united states citizens, just have to [be] accountable for what we do.” but it was what he said about the black community that likely truly infuriated the rioters. “when you look at the most dangerous cities in america. you know atlanta, birmingham, chicago, miami, louisiana,” he explained, “i know from being a black person there’s a lot black people who don’t do right by black people, so you can’t be a hypocrite and say, ‘oh well, a white man or a white police officer just killed a black man.'”   it’s the kind of common sense outlook that more people need to have.       carolina panther cam newton speaks out on violent riots in charlotte: “we can’t be hypocrites” [video]      
__label__1 the united kingdom began construction on what is being called their “great wall” near the border at calais, france. the wall is being built to prevent illegal migrants from jumping onto vehicles preparing to cross the english channel. the wall will cost an estimated two million pounds — about $2.5 million — and will be approximately 13 feet high.   there is a nearby migrant camp called “the jungle” that has been attacking vehicles in an attempt to climb aboard lorries and cars in order to enter the united kingdom. the wall will be made out of concrete, which is more difficult to climb and will be extended by fences. the “jungle” now has more than 10,000 migrants and it has become a hotspot for violence. police have called that area of calais a “no-go” zone after dark, due to the endemic violence in the area. the migrants have been known to cause car crashes, leave debris on the road, thrown rocks off of bridges and started fires. they have also physically attacked drivers with bats, stabbed them with knives and even threatened people with chainsaws.   it is these attacks that encouraged calais port chief executive jean-marc puissesseau to support the wall. “this wall is going to prevent migrants from getting onto the road every night,” he said. “we can no longer continue to put up with these repeated assaults.” liberals in the united kingdom predictably opposed the construction of the wall, comparing it to the policies of donald trump. however, they don’t offer any other alternatives to deal with the problems. thankfully, the british government, along with the french, are not going to allow this kind of violence to continue.       uk begins construction on “great wall” – meant to keep illegal migrants out (video)

__label__1 it takes a lot of courage to tell the world that one of your family members has been radicalized to the point that (s)he is willing to injure and/or kill people. it takes courage because a lot of people would feel horrible “turning” on their family like that and would avoid doing it, believing that they could take care of it within their own home. so, to finally gather that strength and go to the american fbi with the information that your son is engaging in suspicious/potentially terroristic activity, and then to have the very people who are slated with the safety of the american people tell you that your child is not a danger as per their guidelines, has to be a huge relief. until you flip on the news one day and figure out that they were dead wrong.  terrorist suspect ahmad khan rahami’s father, mohammad rahami, went to the federal bureau of investigation in august of 2014 with serious concerns about his son. he says that they investigated ahmad for two months before coming to the conclusion that he is “clean.” mohammad took them at their word and accepted their findings. and then, on an innocent day in september, rahami flipped on the news like millions of other americans and saw the name of a bombing suspect scroll across the screen; his son’s name. “two years ago i go to the f.b.i. because my son was doing really bad, o.k.?” he said. “but they check almost two months, they say, ‘he’s o.k., he’s clean, he’s not a terrorist.’ i say o.k.” he added: “now they say he is a terrorist. i say o.k.” after several weeks of interagency checks, interviews and database reviews, the fbi had determined that ahmad did not pose a terroristic threat to america. then, after being taken into custody, authorities found a blood-stained notebook with a bullet hole in it. in this notebook were writings about “killing the kuffar” and passages that appeared to be sympathetic to the jihadist cause. this, according to a leo who wished to remain anonymous during the interview. in this notebook, which is believed to belong to rahami, there were writings that celebrated lone wolf attacks on american soil, as well as former al qaeda propagandist anwar al-awlaki. keep in mind this whole “my son is a terrorist” bit started with ahmad stabbing his brother in the leg with a knife during an argument. whatever his punishment is determined to be will be too good for him.       father of ahmad khan rahami: i told the police my son was a terrorist & they did nothing      
__label__1 i love a story with a happy ending! when a palestinian teenager attempted to lure an israeli soldier into an ambush, the last thing he probably expected was to be shot down before he could carry out his fatal plan. it makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.  if there’s one thing you need to know about israeli soldiers, male and female, it’s that they are trained to know the moves you are going to make before you even think about making them. they are faced with life and death situations every single day, because they live in the most dangerous area in the world and have been targeted by palestinians and muslims around the world for as long as anyone can remember. apparently this 16 year-old didn’t know what you and i know, and it was the very last mistake he ever made. a surveillance camera captured the 21-second event where issa tarayra – as identified by the palestinian health ministry – approached an idf soldier before attempting to stab him. forces responded to the threat immediately and put the young man down. luckily nobody but tarayra was harmed, as the soldier that was targeted had managed to duck out of the way of the knife just in time. watch the video below, but be aware that while it’s not extremely graphic footage, it may be considered shocking to some. viewer discretion is advised:   according to the daily mail, this is the ninth attack of its kind since the end of the muslim holiday eid al-adha and ahead of october’s jewish holidays. i can’t say i feel too terribly bad for the kid, who decided to risk his life on one stupid act. one less scumbag in the world and good riddance.       video: dramatic moment palestinian lures israeli soldier for knife attack – but is then shot dead

__label__1 make no mistake: the political differences ripping america apart are not merely political ones, but cultural ones as well. we are a culture at war with ourselves. we are separated into the “victim” role and the supposed “oppressor” role. straights, whites and christians are alleged to be the oppressors of all others and a new breed of radicalism has crept up to instill social warfare against these groups to further a self-pitying social and political agenda.   black lives matter is a domestic hate group that furthers hatred for whites and for police officers in a way that the kkk has fostered hatred for minorities. now, according to outspoken conservative milo yiannopoulos, it’s time to criminalize this hate group. “the left does this insane sleight of hand where they try to suggest not liking black lives matter is the same thing as hating black people,” he said during his visit to the university of houston for his “dangerous faggot” tour. “no one is stupid enough to believe that but they keep doing it,” he added. yiannopoulos admitted that there are problems plaguing black communities, but suggested that blm is not the solution, saying that a “violent movement that throws its toys out the pram and leaves black communities in ruins is [not] the answer to those problems.” “we are entering the black power phase of black lives matter existence and it is crossing over into a terrorist organization. it’s time to criminalize it,” he stated. while it would be unconstitutional and wrong to criminalize political speech of any kind, we cannot escape the precedent that is already in place. the kkk is (thankfully) a tattered shred of what it used to be in terms of organization after it was ruled that their urging of violence in the name of hatred was a conspiratorial enterprise to commit lawlessness. while any bigot – black or white – should be free to spout off their nonsense, it is time to delegitimize these racists by holding them responsible for the violent conduct they encourage and urge.         milo yiannopoulos: it’s time to criminalize black lives matter [video]

__label__1 a new crime show has revealed a shocking twist in the case of jonbenet ramsey's murder. on sept. 19, "the case of: jonbenet ramsey" aired on cbs, revealing a surprising suspect in the murder -- her brother, burke ramsey. in 1996, jonbenet, a child beauty queen, was found beaten and strangled to death in her family's cellar, just hours after her mother, patsy, called 911 to report that she had been kidnapped. to this day, no charges have been filed in the case and there has been much speculation about who may be responsible. in the new two-part cbs documentary, a team of experts reviews the evidence in the case and, in the final minutes of the special, reveal that they have reason to believe burke, who was 9 at the time, may be the suspect. the experts believe, however, that jonbenet's death could have been accidental.  it was revealed in the documentary that burke struck his younger sister with a golf club a year before her death after "losing his temper," according to the daily mail. james kolar, former chief of investigation for the district attorney in boulder, presented the theory that burke may be responsible for jonbenet's death. he noted that patsy had left a bowl of pineapple and some tea for burke and that when burke caught jonbenet trying to sneak some of the fruit later on, he lashed out and struck her with a flashlight, killing her. "my hypothesis was that i think the ramseys came home around 9:30, 10 o'clock," kolar said. "i think jonbenet was asleep. i think john did carry her upstairs, patsy remained downstairs with burke and served him the tea and the pineapple. i think that accounts for the physical evidence as well as the latent print. then she got jonbenet up to make sure she used the toilet, so she didn't wet the bed that night." kolar added, "jonbenet was up, she may or may not have brushed her teeth, that stuff was out on the counter, then i think she was up and awake enough that she was maybe still hungry and she went downstairs." "in the meantime, patsy continued packing for the michigan trip," he continued. "i think if burke was upset about circumstances or christmas presents, he probably would have been upset about her trying to snag a piece of pineapple -- out of anger he may have struck her with that flashlight." investigators believe that there was likely no intent to kill on burke's part, but that the ramsey family had intended to mislead the investigation. "the ramsey family did not want law enforcement to resolve this case and that's why it remains unresolved," former fbi profiler jim clemente said. investigators added that they do not believe burke was involved in the cover-up, but that both parents likely were, based on the conflicting motives in the ransom letter. it was also concluded that dna on jonbenet's underwear did not match any family member and did not prove that any sexual assault had taken place, notes us weekly. sources: daily mail, us weekly / photo credit: abc news via yahoo! news      crime show says jonbenet ramsey was killed by brother      
__label__1 police were called to a new jersey elementary school after a 9-year-old student said, "brownies," while talking about snacks, his mother alleged. another student reportedly misinterpreted the comment and thought it was said in a racist way, according to the philadelphia inquirer. a teacher subsequently called police. “he said they were talking about brownies,” stacy dos santos, the child’s mother, said. "who exactly did he offend?" dos santos added that the incident has made her think twice about sending her child back to the school in the fall. “i’m not comfortable with the administration; i don’t trust them, and neither does my child,” she said. “he was intimidated, obviously. there was a police officer with a gun in the holster talking to my son, saying, ‘tell me what you said.’ he didn’t have anybody on his side.” officers also spoke to the children’s parents, and the incident was reported to the new jersey division of child protection and permanency. collingswood police chief kevin carey stated during a meeting with school officials that they should report incidents to police, including cases “as minor as a simple name-calling incident that the school would typically handle internally.” police also said they were advised to refer almost every case to child protection and permanency. this policy was a shift from the previous one under the memorandum of agreement between the police and schools in new jersey, under which incidents were reported only when deemed serious enough. such action was typically taken in cases involving drugs, weapons or sexual assault. since the meeting, officers have been called to the school as often as five times per day. “some of it is just typical little-kid behavior,” teacher megan irwin said. “never before in my years of teaching have i felt uncomfortable handling a situation or felt like i didn’t know how to handle a situation.” the mayor, police and camden county prosecutor’s office ultimately arranged a meeting to discuss incidents.  “in our discussion today, you and your staff made it abundantly clear that our recent meeting was to reinforce the applicability of the memorandum of agreement, but not to expand its terms,” collingswood mayor jim maley wrote in a letter to the prosecutor’s office, the collingswod patch reported.  sources: philadelphia inquirer, collingswood patch / photo credit: google maps via daily mail      police officers called to school after 9-year-old says the word 'brownies'      
__label__1 according to barack obama, what is necessary for countries to defeat terrorism is not a steadfast resolve to decimate these savages with sophisticated military operations. it is not a steadfast resolve to bring the fight to radical islam. nope, according to barack obama, the answer for countering terrorism rests in submitting to a one-world style of government and a willingness to “limit freedom.”   speaking before the united nations general assembly on tuesday, obama told world leaders that our only hope is to rely upon collaborative bodies of government like the un and relinquishing our freedoms – our “freedom of action” as he put it. obama also stated that “powerful nations” like the u.s. will have to limit their freedom in order to submissively submit to the will of the international body – a belief for which obama acknowledges he has been criticized. “we have to put our money where our mouths are. and we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations like my own accept constraints. sometimes i’m criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions, but i’m convinced in the long run giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests but binding ourselves to international rules, over the long-term, enhances our security.” the un was a noble experiment, but one that has long been proven to be a failed one. the practical purpose of the un is nothing more than serving as an agency for redistribution of wealth and power amongst nations. in this body, the u.s. and other powerful nations do the heavy lifting and are only rewarded with limitations, cynicism and collectivist-inspired resentment from other nations. since america elected a president who prioritizes the needs of other nations over the needs of the one he has sworn to serve, we have fared poorly on the global stage and it is hardly surprising to see that our outgoing coward has remained true to his vision of one-world governance and limitations of freedom throughout the world. remember when america had presidents that believed in america so much that they stressed that the rest of the world should try to strive for our kind of ideals instead of the other way around?         submit or perish: obama demands limits on american freedoms at the un [video]      
__label__1 there is no law against burning the american flag. there is no law against stomping upon it either. however, that doesn’t mean that parents should have to accept a teacher teaching their kids to hate america.   hatred for america and her history and values is all the rage these days amongst the left. believing it to be chic and edgy, many liberals are apt to stomp upon the flag that greater americans than they fought and died to defend. one history teacher at a public school stomped on the american flag to prove some kind of point and now, unsurprisingly, people are upset. a teacher on monday at massey hill classical high school in fayetteville, north carolina – home of fort bragg and america’s special forces – stomped on the flag to prove a point about the value of the first amendment. the school district claims that they are investigating the incident. however, with teachers being fiercely guarded by union extortionists, it’s doubtful that this man will see any repercussions unless he dares to mention christ. “what that teacher did was a gut punch to all the military kids at that school,” one parent said. “more so to the ones with deployed parents and unforgivably so to gold star kids who lost a parent who fought under that flag. it is indefensible.” “clearly there are other ways to teach first amendment rights without desecrating a flag,” the superintendent said. students reported that the teacher had attempted to burn and tear the flag before stomping on it. several students were upset and some walked out in protest of the disgrace. this man should not be thrown into a gulag, but let’s not pretend that teaching kids to hate america and her symbols of freedom is some kind of educational opportunity. just another day in the far-left educational system…         history teacher stomps on the american flag in the classroom      
__label__1 it used to be in ancient times that soldiers that fought for their nations were respected. history doesn’t remember ancient hippies, or archaic anti-war activist groups…probably because they were all killed…anyways, today this kind of despicable behavior is the norm. it’s not uncommon to encounter these kinds of people in your everyday life. they saturate the planet. of course none of them have ever served their country and most likely would rather sacrifice the life of a human being (not their own) over an animal (harambe). not to say that bad soldiers don’t exit. they do. there’s bad guys in every walk of life and that should be expected.  but what happens when you have a memorial monument dedicated to a major battle in your country’s history totally desecrated by a disgusting excuse for a human being? kelly martin, 42, incensed public decency when she desecrated, and that’s exactly the word needed here, the monument in broad daylight in grays, essex… first in april when there were still remembrance wreaths that were set upon it. if that wasn’t bad enough, this beastly woman did it again back in june – the day before the 100th anniversary of the start of the battle of the somme. martin, who looked as disheveled as ever, shouted ‘f*** this’ as she was led down to the cells at basildon crown court, on her way to receive her sentence.  judge john lodge, the lucky duck that had the privilege of passing sentencing, said: ‘each of these offences is so serious that only a custodial sentence is appropriate. the two cases of outraging public decency involve urinating on a war memorial…inevitably war memorials were constructed at the center of towns and villages so on a daily basis people could be reminded of the sacrifices made by people who died…people use them as a place around which they congregate and that’s not wrong, but when people take that step further and abuse them by urinating on them that’s a matter the court needs to take very seriously indeed.’ speaking to the piss monster herself, judge lodge said this: ‘what makes your case particularly bad is having been caught doing it one time, when the nation was commemorating the worst battle of the first world war you were caught doing it again in the middle of the day.’ throw the book at her judge. she obviously hasn’t learned to be a human being.       jobless mom of 5 shouts ‘f*** this’ as she’s jailed for 7 months for urinating on war memorial twice      
__label__1 in today’s world, if you really want to ruin someone’s life, you attack them…digitally. it’s 2016 and the world is run by tech. everyone’s lives are written out on social media, in online banking, in cookies and in their history. hackers all over the world steal identities and assets and sell them.  everything is run by computers it seems and it’s generally a way to make human existence easier, convenient and safer in most cases. but when technology goes wrong, it can do a lot of damage. it truly is a chilling world with all the types of hacking that are out there and with the automated car becoming the transportation of the future, hacking is seeming to be a bigger concern. in the past, darpa researchers found weaknesses that would let a hacker shut down the brakes on some cars, while other research teams have found a simple text message can be enough to gain access to your car’s computer. now, a team of chinese researchers have figured out a way to hack into the car brains of a tesla.   the good news is that keen security lab are “white hat” hackers. meaning they are employed by tesla to find and report security vulnerabilities in order to make the stuff we use safer. so yeah…no need to worry about the chinese government hacking into american vehicles…yet. the remote access allowed the hackers to do just about anything they wanted with the car. they don’t seem to have been able to compromise the car’s autopilot feature, but what they can control is still worrying enough for potential consumers to put a hold on purchasing one of these bad boys. better to be safe than sorry. tesla owners have the ability to upgrade their cars by downloading the latest patches. that’s what makes tesla different than other vehicles out there. it’s pretty much a driving computer.       watch hackers hijack a moving tesla from miles away!

__label__1 it does not matter anymore. the truth. procedure. commonsense. with all the hatred and immediate blame thrown on police officers for anything ranging from shootings to sneezes, it’s no wonder so many police departments are suffering with recruits. who wants to be blamed for being a racist murderer when you are not one?  it just does not matter anymore. in this country, police are guilty until proven innocent in the eye of the public court of opinion. there have been police that have abused their power and those ones have been punished. but so many others along the way have been demonized by leftist media and terrorist activist groups like black lives matter and the new black panthers. we can’t even agree as a people what is proper procedure for police. for instance, if you are told by police to stop moving, to stop moving your hands, to stop reaching your hands into places… is it then credible for an officer to use deadly force? blm would say absolutely not. but why? could a suspect be reaching for a gun? yes. so many officers have been gunned down in exactly that type of scenario. yet blm and its followers demand that the officers talk their way out of situations like that. they demand that they use a taser. they demand that they shoot them in the leg. they demand a whole lot of stupid crap that they themselves would never demand of themselves. what is justifiable self-defense to sane folks is straight out murder to others. in tulsa, oklahoma, another shooting by a white police officer has led to another black man’s death. the activists are out demanding justice…but when you ignore the orders of an officer, walk away from them back to your vehicle, then proceed to try and reach into your vehicle…what do you think the officers are thinking? gun. that’s it. so, if you want to play dumb and ignore the warnings of cops, then your dumb ass deserves what’s coming.   a spokesman for the tulsa, oklahoma, police department says officers found pcp in the suv of an unarmed black man who was shot dead by a white female cop last week. sgt. dave walker told the tulsa world investigators they recovered a vial of the drug in terence crutcher’s vehicle after he was gunned down by officer betty shelby. police say crutcher, 40, did not have a gun on him or in his vehicle. video footage of the shooting also showed him walking toward his suv with his hands in the air. shelby’s attorney said tuesday morning that his client had suspected crutcher was high and opened fire after he reached through the window, perceiving it as a threat.       white female cop shoots and kills black suspect who reaches in vehicle…the activists call it ‘plain murder’ [video]      
__label__1 i watched both shootings of black men play out yesterday and i have something to say about each of them here today. the shooting in tulsa, where i live, is being portrayed as a white cop shooting an innocent black man. not quite. terence crutcher has a rap sheet a mile long. he had been arrested at least 12 times previously. they found pcp in his stalled suv. what the media would have you believe is that he was just standing by his stalled car when the evil cops showed up and shot him while he had his arms raised. he was indeed unarmed, but as you will see in the video below, he was walking with his arms and hands raised after being told repeatedly to stop by the police. he kept on going until he got back to his car and then he started to reach in the window for something. that is when a white, female officer shot him fatally. his attorney is claiming the window was up when he arrived… it is pretty clear that the guy was reaching inside that vehicle when he was shot. two officers fired simultaneously – one a taser and one a gun. it was a justified shooting – he was not shot with his hands up. from my viewpoint, the officer followed procedure. was she supposed to wait and see if he pulled a gun and fired on them before shooting the guy? no, that is not how they are trained. the guy was not obeying commands and he looked high to me. hundreds showed up in tulsa last night to protest… it was black lives matter again. originally, people said he was a pastor… not true, he was a criminal and the officers acted in a way to protect themselves as a last resort. now, onto north carolina, where the black man was armed, shot and killed as well… by a black police officer.  from gateway pundit: protests erupted in charlotte, north carolina tuesday after 43-year-old keith lamont scott was shot and killed by a police officer. the man was reportedly shot by a black officer. protesters attacked police, hit a reporter in the head with a rock and trashed a police cruiser. the shooting occurred around 4 p.m. at the village at college downs apartment complex in northeast charlotte. according to wbtv, officers said they were searching for a person with an outstanding warrant when they saw a man get out of a vehicle with a firearm. lamont scott got out of the vehicle “armed with a firearm and posed an imminent deadly threat to the officers who subsequently fired their weapon striking the subject.” black lives matter activists gathered tonight to protest the shooting. they’re hurling water bottles at police. twelve police officers were injured last night as hundreds of black lives matter protesters rioted and looted after keith lamont scott was shot and killed by a police officer in charlotte. his daughter is circulating a video claiming he was innocent of course… a father of seven, reading in his car and waiting for his son to get home from school and that he was unarmed. that’s touching, but it’s not reality according to the police and just as in tulsa, i’m far more willing to believe the police here than blm. according to officers, they were looking for a suspect when they came across scott in his car. they were in plain clothes and ordered scott out of his car. he got out with a gun and then got back in. he got out a second time still with his gun in hand and they took him down because he was an armed threat. a gun was recovered from the scene. several hundred rioters went to town last night in charlotte. they threw bricks and water bottles at the police. the police lobbed tear gas at the rioters. the blm asshats stole cargo off trucks and set fire to it in the middle of the street. they tried to loot a walmart and were pushed back by police. they destroyed two police vehicles and assaulted the media. they set trucks on fire as well. “we out like the taliban!” one rioter could be heard crying on a facebook live broadcast of the protests, shortly after tear gas canisters were fired into the crowd. after 11 pm, the situation grew more severe, with several people successfully trashing a police suv. the police also used flash grenades to disperse the crowds. i didn’t see any, but i’ll bet pepper spray was used as well. some protesters were heard yelling ‘black lives matter!’ and ‘hands up, don’t shoot!’. they held up a sign saying ‘stop killing us!’ and ‘it was a book!’, making reference to the object scott was reportedly holding when he was shot dead. officer brentley vinson – a former college football player – was identified as the officer who shot scott, wccb reports. officer vinson, who has worked at the department since july of 2014 and is also black, has been placed on paid on administrative leave, as is standard procedure in such cases. what you are seeing is a ginned up race war with cop-hatred for fuel. both of these incidents were justified and the police were doing their jobs. if you do not obey a police officer repeatedly, you are going to get shot. if you have a gun and brandish it at them, you are going to get shot. black lives matter is a radical, racist terrorist group and its members should be treated as such.       for context, the shooting of terence crutcher:                      chaos taking over charlotte after fatal shooting – police under attack, protesters rioting… [video]      
__label__1 we’ve never seen anything like this before in the sport of nascar… there are many people that don’t believe in things that nascar does. but those are mostly things like penalties and rules on the track. it’s not often that we say anyone complain about how the sport treats and includes people, simply because everyone for the most part thinks nascar does a pretty swell job. but it looks like there’s one person who disagrees. that one person is terrance cox iii, a georgia man who has operated diversity motorsports racing as well created a group to protest against nascar, alleging that officials, teams and owners are unjust towards the minority community.  this past friday, cox filed a $500 million race discrimination lawsuit against nascar and its race teams due to claims that the sanctioning body of nascar would never help him as he tried to make nascar more racially diverse. in cox’s complaint, he stated that “potential sponsors were encouraged by nascar to not work with him but instead go for drivers like tony stewart and dale jr.” they also allegedly refused to promote different programs that cox created in order to make nascar more diverse.  lastly, cox is claiming that nascar has “engaged in unlawful intentional racial discrimination by refusing to sanction african-american owned racing teams … and by refusing to hire african-american drivers for its racing teams.” has nascar responded to this? hell yeah! they’ve released a statement defending their drive for diversity program and have let cox and everyone know that they are going to fight this lawsuit. “nascar embraces all individuals interested and involved in our sport, whether as partners, fans, competitors or employees, and there is no merit to this lawsuit. nascar has a long-standing history of investing in diversity efforts including the nascar drive for diversity, nascar diversity internship and nascar diversity pit crew development programs. … we stand behind our actions, and will not let a publicity-seeking legal action deter us from our mission. nascar not only will defend our organization against these meritless allegations, but we will be asserting our own claims against mr. cox for his defamatory actions. we established these [diversity] programs to create opportunities for women and minorities, and embrace people of all backgrounds, within the industry. diversity both on and off the track continues to be a top priority for nascar and its stakeholders.“ there is one full-time african-american driver in nascar and his name is darrell wallace jr. wallace races for roush fenway racing and competes in the xfinity series. we will give further detail as the case unfolds.       breaking: nascar sued for $500 million, this could be the end      
__label__1 this is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the clinton health access initiative. anything with ‘clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many africans. they distributed “watered-down” hiv/aids drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. an indian drug manufacturer called ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the clintons know about it. i’m betting that they did. ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. the doj also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. so, one wonders why the clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this. “this is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the district of maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said us attorney for the district of maryland rod j. rosenstein when ranbaxy pleaded guilty.  from the daily caller: former president bill clinton and his clinton health access initiative (chai) distributed “watered-down” hiv/aids drugs to patients in sub-saharan africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by the daily caller news foundation. the congressional report, titled,“the clinton foundation and the india success story,” was initiated by rep. marsha blackburn, a tennessee republican and vice-chair of the house energy and commerce committee. the chai program to help aids victims is considered one of the clinton foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. the congressional report focused on clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial indian drug manufacturer called ranbaxy, which chai used as one of its main distributors of hiv/aids drugs to third world countries. it also highlighted the work of dinesh thakur, a former ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the u.s. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the indian firm. the company was vulnerable to u.s. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the u.s. market. ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. “the question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked blackburn in an interview with the dcnf. this could definitely bring further scrutiny to the clinton charities and to the clintons themselves. right when they need it least. a congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between bill clinton and the two indian-americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the fda and the sec. what is very troubling is the clinton foundation’s aggressive promotion of ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the fda. it is unclear at this juncture how many aids patients received the “watered-down” drugs. but that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. all for money. propublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the us agency for international development allocated $9 million to ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “substandard hiv medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from hiv-related infections,” roger bate, an economist at the american enterprise institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the dcnf. ranbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the us, but they are still selling and distributing hiv/aids drugs worldwide. the clinton foundation and clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either. companies that partner with the clinton foundation and charities make a ton of money. corruption is rampant. bill and hillary clinton obviously care nothing about black people or humans in general… their primary interest is monetary.        new clinton foundation scandal just broke – this is what hillary actually thinks about black people…
